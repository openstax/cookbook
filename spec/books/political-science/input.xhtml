The authors take a balanced approach to micro-and macroeconomics, to both Keynesian and classical views, and to the theory and application of economics concepts.

<li><strong>Supply and Demand</strong>, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.</li>

<li><strong>The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory</strong>, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics portion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different models of market structure, including some simple game theory.</li>
<li><strong>Microeconomic Policy Issues</strong>, Chapters 11 through 18, covers the range of topics in applied micro, framed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities.  Students explore competition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor market issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, as well as public economy.</li>
<li><strong>The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals</strong>, Chapters 19 through 23, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows.</li>
<li><strong>A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis</strong>, Chapters 24 through 26, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.  The model is then applied to the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives.  The expenditure-output model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary and Fiscal Policy</strong>, Chapters 27 through 31, explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary policy and financial regulation.  Then the discussion switches to government deficits and fiscal policy.</li>

<li><strong>International Economics</strong>, Chapters 32 through 34, the final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

In the case of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, we received a wealth of constructive feedback.  Many of the book’s users felt that consequential movement in economic data, coupled with the impacts of national and global events, warranted a full revision. We also took advantage of the opportunity to improve the writing and sequencing of the text, as well as many of the calculation examples. The major changes are summarized below.</p><ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-447"><li>Augmented explanations in chapters one through four provide a more comprehensive and informative foundation for the book. </li>
<li>A clearer explanation, using a numerical example, has been given for finding the utility maximizing combination of goods and services a consumer should choose.</li>
<li>The Theory of Production has been added to the chapter on costs &amp; industry structure.</li>
<li> A more complete treatment has been given to labor markets, including the theories of competitive and monopsonistic labor markets, and bilateral monopoly; and the labor markets chapter and the poverty and
economic inequality chapter have been resequenced.</li>
<li>Substantial revisions to the AD/AS model in chapters 24-26 present the core concepts of macroeconomics in a clearer, more dynamic manner. </li>
<li>Case studies and examples have been revised and, in some cases, replaced to provide more relevant and useful information for students.</li>
<li>Economic data, tables, and graphs, as well as discussion and analysis around that data, have been thoroughly updated.</li> </ul><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-318">Wherever possible, data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) was included and referenced.  In most of these uses, links to the direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged to explore the information and the overall FRED resources more thoroughly.

</p><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-594">Additional updates and revisions appear throughout the book.  They reflect changes to economic realities and policies regarding international trade, taxation, insurance, and other topics.  For issues that may change in the months or years following the textbook's publication, the authors often provided a more open-ended explanation, but we will update the text annually to address further changes. </p><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-204">The revision of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> was undertaken by Steven Greenlaw (University of Mary Washington) and David Shapiro (Pennsylvania State University), with significant input by lead reviewer Daniel MacDonald (California State University, San Bernardino).</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-27"><h4 data-type="title">Pedagogical foundation</h4><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-987">Throughout the OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, you will find new features that engage the students in economic inquiry by taking selected topics a step further.

It is broken up into two parts:  the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the intro module) and the second at chapter’s end, when students have learned what’s necessary to understand the case and “bring home” the chapter’s core concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Work It Out:</strong> This added feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them step by step to find out how its solution is derived. </li>
<li><strong>Clear It Up:</strong> This boxed feature, which includes pre-existing features from Taylor’s text, addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts with a question.  The rest of the feature explains the answer.</li>
<li><strong>Link It Up:</strong> This added feature is a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students’ understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.  </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-651"><h4 data-type="title">Questions for each level of learning</h4><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-454">The OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> further expands on Taylor’s original end of chapter materials by offering four types of end of module questions for students:
</p><ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-284"><li><strong>Self-Checks</strong> are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They “click to reveal” an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think beyond what is said in the text.  Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through the problem.  </li>
<li><strong>Review Questions</strong> have been retained from Taylor’s version, and are simple recall questions from the chapter in open-response format (not multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text. </li>
<li><strong>Critical Thinking Questions</strong> are new higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to <em data-effect="italics">demonstrate their understanding by applying</em> what they have learned in different contexts.

A year later, in 1986, Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland became the first female Senator to win a seat not by appointment but in her own right during a regular election cycle (Figure 8.1). Mikulski’s historic win was thanks in part to the efforts of those twenty-five women, who met and started a political interest group and PAC called EMILYs List <a href="#auto_376411b4-866d-452e-b769-0ae14fbab80a_rf-1" data-type="cite">

<p id="auto_bbfeed6b-4d1b-4c34-b593-168c1f6ff858_fs-idm222808512">In the early 1980s at the start of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in America, government response to the increasing need for medical research and assistance to HIV/AIDS patients was scant. In the absence of a federal or state-run public health response, public interest advocacy groups such as The Gay Men’s Health Project provided services for AIDS patients, gathering donations for food and securing shelter for those afflicted by the disease. Almost a decade later, with still no public health response on the part of the federal government, a group named the Lavender Hill Mob vocally criticized the Center for Disease Control’s handling of the epidemic, storming the agency’s planned convention on the epidemic and demanding research into drugs and treatment. Soon other groups such as ACTUP formed, calling on the government to respond to the need for more public education to prevent the disease and more resources for further research into ending it.<a href="#auto_bbfeed6b-4d1b-4c34-b593-168c1f6ff858_rf-2" data-type="cite">

</a> President Ronald Reagan ultimately created the Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic in 1987 in response to citizen activism and public calls for governmental involvement. The history of group mobilization around HIV/AIDS illustrates how interest groups can harness the cooperation and collaboration of individuals in pursuit of a common goal, but also how multiple groups can work in concert to pressure the government to act. </p><figure id="auto_bbfeed6b-4d1b-4c34-b593-168c1f6ff858_eip-idm24438112"><div data-type="title" id="auto_bbfeed6b-4d1b-4c34-b593-168c1f6ff858_1">Test title</div><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="auto_bbfeed6b-4d1b-4c34-b593-168c1f6ff858_eip-idm24933408" data-alt="Insert Alt Text">

How and why do interest groups such as the NAACP or the United States Chamber of Commerce form? Three major theories about interest group formation allow us to better understand how interest groups function within the political sphere. Pluralist theory posits that multiple and diverse interests compete for attention and resources and that political power is distributed amongst these various interests. Competition amongst interests allows for the representation of a diversity of views, rather than solely those of elite interests, and prevents single issues from dominating public discourse. David Truman’s work on Disturbance Theory suggests that interest groups form in response to the changing complexity of government and society. For example, as rapid advances in technology leave workers unemployed, groups form to rally for governmental response. <a href="#auto_bbfeed6b-4d1b-4c34-b593-168c1f6ff858_rf-14" data-type="cite">

Salisbury, in his work <em data-effect="italics">An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups</em>, argues that political actors are not influenced by groups that have mobilized to enact change so much as they are responding to the interests of narrowly focused elites, and that the relationship between interest groups and government is that of an exchange. <a href="#auto_bbfeed6b-4d1b-4c34-b593-168c1f6ff858_rf-15" data-type="cite">

</a> As argued by noted theorist Mancur Olson, this idea rests on the notion that, because of the idea of <span data-type="term">collective goods</span> and the <span data-type="term">free rider problem</span>, individuals will not exert extra energy to mobilize into groups. In other words, while an interest group works to provide its members with collective goods (goods or services that all members can share), there is no incentive for all members to work for those goods. Free riders gain the benefits of membership without action. </p></section><div data-type="note" id="auto_bbfeed6b-4d1b-4c34-b593-168c1f6ff858_fs-idm360682224" class="connecting-courses"><div data-type="title" id="auto_bbfeed6b-4d1b-4c34-b593-168c1f6ff858_5">Economics</div>
  <p id="auto_bbfeed6b-4d1b-4c34-b593-168c1f6ff858_fs-idm371308800">Political science and economics both fall under the umbrella of social science, which is the study of human relationships. Economics      examines the production, consumption, and distribution of goods, such as food or sneakers, and services, such as getting your lawn mowed or receiving a college education. In this chapter, the terms economic bias, collective goods, the free rider problem, and adverse selection all overlap with the study of economics. There are many reasons for the overlap. For example, our government is naturally concerned with production—how  much American companies are making and selling, and with consumption—are Americans buying cars? Fast food? Houses? Government redistributes wealth in the form of taxes, which naturally interests both political scientists and economists. Where can we see this? For example, with the recent pandemic, the U.S. government is interested in buying as many vaccines as it can for Americans. This illustrates one aspect of the relationship between economics and government. While some economics majors will never take a political science class, and vice versa, there is a natural alignment with the two fields that is worth understanding. </p>

  <p id="auto_bbfeed6b-4d1b-4c34-b593-168c1f6ff858_fs-idm245812080">An interest group is an organized collection of individuals who work to influence government and policy. There are several different types of interest groups. Economic groups can be divided into categories such as business groups, labor groups, agricultural groups, and professional groups. Non-economic groups include public interest groups, single issue groups, civil rights groups, and ideological groups. Various theories explain why interest groups form. Pluralism suggests that diverse interests represent a variety of views and demands, and that political powers are distributed amongst these various groups. Disturbance theory, on the other hand, asserts that interest groups respond and change to complex issues in society and calls on the government to react to these changes. Transaction theory refutes pluralism, arguing that government actors only respond to a narrow set of interests.</p></section>

</a> Interest groups form to influence political outcomes, and as this fast food example illustrates, there is probably an interest group for almost every issue. Should we encourage the Taco Bells of the world to organize and work to persuade the government to pass laws in their favor, or is this type of activity harmful to our political process? This section will discuss the pros and cons of interest groups, the role they play in government, and to what extent interest groups are regulated.

In <em data-effect="italics">Federalist no. 10</em>, Madison argued that while the threat of factions exists, a healthy representative government would ensure that no single interest monopolizes the government’s attention, and that competition amongst interests, (pluralism,) will ultimately enhance democracy. In this way, the model of interest group activity can be seen as an ideal way to serve the common good because it allows more voices to engage in the political process, which is part and parcel of self-governance.</p><p id="auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_fs-idm357538128">Ultimately, citizen participation in government is essential in part because political actors have difficulty discerning what is important to the public unless the public itself is involved in the process. In this way, interest group activity allows the government to understand the will of the people by seeing which issues are of concern. Additionally, the act of citizen mobilization is thought to produce <span data-type="term">social capital</span>, whereby relationships forged in political and other social networks help citizens resolve collective problems. Finally, like HIV/AIDS activists in the early 1980s, interest groups can take up issues that are marginalized by traditional political actors.

Theoretically, pluralism should work to protect the interests of the many: When multiple interests strive to be heard by governmental actors, multiple interests are also addressed. However, this can bring about problems of <span data-type="term">factionalism</span>, where small groups of people with shared interest work to have their wishes represented in government, despite majority interests.. In other words, and also addressed by James Madison in <em data-effect="italics">Federalist</em> no. 10,  while a multitude of interests may be represented, not all are heard or responded to equally, and a narrow interest may hijack political attention at the expense of the majority’s needs. Further, the more socially, monetarily, or institutionally resourced an interest, the more influence it enjoys, regardless of how narrow or seemingly obscure it might be. This latter problem, known as <span data-type="term">economic bias</span>, is a weakness of the interest group system. As Political scientist E. E. Schattschneider explains, "The flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper-class accent."<a href="#auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_rf-19" data-type="cite">

</a> Groups that represent business or professional interests tend to be better resourced, and though lower class interests can be represented, interest group membership itself is mostly skewed towards those who make up the upper-middle and upper classes, as individuals who make up these groups tend to have more time and resources to commit to this type of political activity. In addition, there is a “chicken or egg” characteristic in interest group membership in that, as long as upper-middle class and upper class interest are represented, these groups naturally attract individuals from these populations and not those in more disadvantaged groups. The theory of <span data-type="term">interest group liberalism</span> highlights another noted weakness of the interest group system. <a href="#auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_rf-20" data-type="cite">

The formal work of interest groups is referred to as lobbying, the attempt by a group to influence a political outcome. Lobbying can take on different forms, and groups often lobby different branches and types of government. Lobbying itself can be further divided into two categories, <span data-type="term">inside lobbying</span> and <span data-type="term">outside lobbying</span>.</p> <div data-type="note" id="auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_eip-idm249128416" class="meet-professional"><div data-type="title" id="auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_1">Blue Shield of California</div><figure id="auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_eip-idm225093680"><span data-type="media" id="auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_eip-idm223025328" data-alt="Insert Alt Text">

Examples of inside lobbying include lobbying the legislative branch of government, such as the United States Congress, in order to provide testimony, suggest items for consideration, aid in the crafting of legislation, or mobilize constituents to write their members of congress to support or vote against certain bills. Interests groups also lobby other parts of government, including the executive branch. They do so by working with federal agencies, executive appointees, and, in the case of the United States, even the White House, to do much of the same work they do when lobbying congress. This work includes identifying or introducing specific pieces of legislation that will further their cause, providing information for or writing drafts of policy proposals, and mobilizing constituent support. Interest group lobbying of the judicial system differs from lobbying of other branches because the courts do not write or pass legislation. As such, groups work to influence the judicial branch in other ways. The first is connected to ways groups lobby the other two branches in that interest groups can try to influence judicial appointments by suggesting possible appointees for the other two branches to nominate and confirm. Interest groups also use <em data-effect="italics">amicus curiae</em>, or friend of the court briefs, to lobby the judiciary. Using <em data-effect="italics">amicus curiae</em>, groups file official positions to make known to judges and justices their official positions on cases being heard before a court. Depending on the case and the group, interest groups can also use their resources to file cases in lower courts or have appeals heard in higher courts such as the Supreme Court. A recent example is the <em data-effect="italics">Sierra Club v. Trump</em>, where the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), acting on behalf of the Sierra Club, and Southern Border Communities Coalition, filed suit against President Trump in his use of executive power to fund and build a border wall on the southern border of the United States. <a href="#auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_rf-21" data-type="cite">

Interest groups also utilize tactics such as <span data-type="term">outside lobbying</span>, also known as <span data-type="term">indirect</span> or <span data-type="term">grassroots lobbying</span>, which entails rallying public support in order to pressure political actors to consider their causes. In outside lobbying, groups call upon their own members as well as the general public to take up the mantle of their cause through a show of public support. The recent movement to recall California Governor Gavin Newsom is an example of this type of grassroots lobbying. <a href="#auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_rf-24" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_rf-24">

 The latest attempt to reform lobbying practices, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, placed tighter restrictions on campaign contributions through PACs and on campaign travel and adjusted definitions of what constitutes a lobbyist, whether an “in-house” lobbyist who works within an organization or an “outside” lobbyist who is hired to represent interest groups. Among other changes, the act included so-called “Revolving Door Bans” that require elected officials to wait at least a year after serving in government before joining a lobbying firm, and also limits monetary value of gifts lobbyists can receive. <a href="#auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_rf-28" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_rf-28">

  <p id="auto_839eb105-4201-4d04-a413-90f5ed4e7dab_fs-idm224121008">Interest groups are important to the political process because they bring a diversity of views and demands before the popularly elected government. Interest groups also foster the development of social capital, or the maintenance of relationships and networks that allow citizens to solve collective problems. However, interest groups have their downsides. One is factionalism: while a multitude of interest groups may represent many problems, only a small number of them garner the government’s attention. This may be due to the economic bias in the interest groups system, where monied interests are more likely to be represented and catered to. Interest groups work to influence government through inside lobbying, which is when groups create formal relationships with governmental officials. When interest groups rally public support for policies or political candidates, they engage in outside lobbying. The last attempt to reform lobbying activity was in 2007, though in 2021 President Biden signed a series of Executive Orders limiting lobbyist involvement in the Executive branch.</p></section>

<p id="auto_df4e4ef8-c159-424f-b42a-e4a0fc505956_fs-idm355327824">In 1993, the United Kingdom Independent party (UKIP) formed with the aim of withdrawing England from the European Union. While its founder, Alan Sked, ultimately withdrew from his own party, citing its alarming movement towards overtly racist and ultra conservative ideologies, the party endured, electing three members to the European parliament in 1999, one of them named Nigel Farage. By 2014, UKIP held multiple seats in the European parliament and a seat in the English parliament, and in 2016, twenty-three years after the party’s inception, Farage led the party to securing its proverbial brass ring, winning a referendum vote on whether Britain should become an independent economic entity.<a href="#auto_df4e4ef8-c159-424f-b42a-e4a0fc505956_rf-31" data-type="cite">

  </div>
</a> On January 31st, 2020, Britain’s exit from the European Union (Brexit) marked the country’s independence from the European economic union. UKIP, once considered a fringe political party, had pulled off one of the biggest coups in England’s political history.

Political parties have a lot in common with interest groups. Like interest groups, political parties operate to influence policy makers. However, political parties differ from interest groups in one crucial way. While PACs donate to certain candidates, interest groups ultimately work with any elected official if they feel doing so will meet their policy ends. In contrast, political parties seek to control government from within by getting as many of their party members elected as possible. 
</p><p id="auto_df4e4ef8-c159-424f-b42a-e4a0fc505956_eip-175">Like interest groups, parties form in response to the need for collective action. Their activities allow candidates to reach and mobilize individual voters, or as Marjorie Randon Hershey writes, political parties are a means by which people agree to behave cooperatively over the long term so as to secure benefits that they would not have been able to gain as individuals. <a href="#auto_df4e4ef8-c159-424f-b42a-e4a0fc505956_rf-32" data-type="cite">

Political parties, like interest groups and their PACs, raise money for campaigns. By electing members of their parties to government, parties work to garner a majority coalition in order to direct policy outcomes, and in the United States, money in elections continues to grow. In the 2020 election cycle, both parties raised close to $2 billion dollars to distribute to various candidates and their campaigns. <a href="#auto_df4e4ef8-c159-424f-b42a-e4a0fc505956_rf-37" data-type="cite">

</a></p><p id="auto_df4e4ef8-c159-424f-b42a-e4a0fc505956_eip-615">As previously stated, parties are instrumental in identifying potential members, and registering new voters is a key component of their work. Because American voters are not automatically registered to vote and, depending on their state of residence, may be required to register with a party in order to vote in a political primary, political parties shoulder the important burden of finding new voters to participate in elections. While close to half of voters in the United States register to vote in their states when they apply for a driver’s license, political parties try to make up the difference by registering as many members to their own parties as they can. In the 2020 election, the Republican party added close to 150,000 new voters in Florida and 30,000 additional voters in Arizona. <a href="#auto_df4e4ef8-c159-424f-b42a-e4a0fc505956_rf-38" data-type="cite">

</a></p><p id="auto_df4e4ef8-c159-424f-b42a-e4a0fc505956_eip-286">Political parties also vet and recruit candidates for election and a party that cannot nominate candidates is toothless in its power. Seligman echoes this sentiment, calling candidate recruitment a basic function of a political party. The extent to which parties perform this function varies by country. The United Kingdom is an example of a parliamentary system where the party plays an important role in candidate recruitment, where elected officials often cut their teeth in local governmental before being considered for a seat in Parliament. In the United States, candidate recruitment is increasingly seen as a responsibility political parties and interest groups share, with the latter taking on more of the gatekeeping role in recent years thanks to their organizational powers and ability to gather resources and mobilize supporters. <a href="#auto_df4e4ef8-c159-424f-b42a-e4a0fc505956_rf-43" data-type="cite">

Over time the two parties have taken on different forms and names, starting with the Federalists and the Democratic Republican parties, then the Whigs and the Democrats, and now the Democrats and Republicans. While third parties like the Green Party and Democratic Socialists certainly exist, the United States is considered a two-party system since only two parties have a realistic chance of wielding political control. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the Conservatives (Tories) and the Labor party enjoyed long-standing dominance throughout the 20th century. However, the emergence of the Liberal Democratic party, UKIP (UK Independence Party), and smaller influential parties at the local and regional level has altered the United Kingdom’s traditional two-party system, making it look more like a <span data-type="term">multiparty system</span>. <a href="#auto_df4e4ef8-c159-424f-b42a-e4a0fc505956_rf-44" data-type="cite">

</a> Germany provides another interesting example of a multiparty system. Prior to Hitler’s rise, over a dozen political parties held seats in the German government. After the rise of Nazi Germany, the country became a single-party government (Third Reich), and this single party structure remained in place from 1933-1945 until the end of the second World War. Germany subsequently broke into two separate countries, East and West Germany. A single party, the Communist German Democratic Party, ruled East Germany. During this era, several parties grew in West Germany, including the Christian Democratic Party, and after the reunification of Germany in 1990, Christian Democratic Party majority party leader Helmut Kohl led the government. Fast-forward to 2016, the outcome of the German election led to a “Six Party Government,” <a href="#auto_df4e4ef8-c159-424f-b42a-e4a0fc505956_rf-46" data-type="cite">

  <p id="auto_df4e4ef8-c159-424f-b42a-e4a0fc505956_fs-idm232561648">A political party is a group of people who share a common political ideology and work to get their members elected into government. In addition to scouting and electing candidates, political parties raise money and work to influence governmental policy. Parties are also heavily involved in registering new voters to vote. Party systems take on different forms. In the U.S., we have what is called a two-party system, where there are two major political parties involved in government activity. In contrast, much of Europe uses a multi-party system, where the government is made up of multiple parties that must share power. Single-party systems, like those in China and North Korea, are political systems that consist of only one party. </p>

<p id="auto_876b5337-db3e-412d-80ff-5a3ee37b31b2_fs-idm348425056">Historically, political parties have held considerable power in recruiting candidates, mobilizing voters, and securing funds for nominees. Many Americans’ image of party politics involves William Tweed, or “Boss Tweed,” a 19th century Democratic party operative who used corrupt methods to exert power and influence within New York City politics. He remains a significant figure in American political history as an example of the height of both the potential corruption and power of the party system, a system that some argue has begun its descent in terms of its ability to fulfill its basic roles.

</a> Perot did not win the election, but he managed to take 20% of the popular vote.

Political parties have not just weakened in the United States, but across the globe. Miar and Biezen found both that levels of party membership have declined as a proportion of the electorate and that there has been a major decline in the absolute numbers of party members across all the long-established European democracies. <a href="#auto_876b5337-db3e-412d-80ff-5a3ee37b31b2_rf-52" data-type="cite">

</a> Paul Whiteley likewise describes a well-documented, long-term decline in party activism across Europe, and attributes this trend to parties being too close to the state and no longer working to recruit and rely on membership for their work. <a href="#auto_876b5337-db3e-412d-80ff-5a3ee37b31b2_rf-53" data-type="cite">

  <p id="auto_876b5337-db3e-412d-80ff-5a3ee37b31b2_fs-idm222330304">Some scholars argue that political parties play a decreasing role in U.S. politics due to the rise of the candidate-centered campaign. In candidate-centered campaigns, candidates are increasingly less reliant on      parties to run for office. These candidates may be independently wealthy, and in recent years there has been a      rise of populist candidates who are less reliant on traditional political structures. Lower voter registration rates, declines in party activism, economic factors, and the rise of communication technologies illustrate a weakening of party systems around the world.</p>

An election is a formal decision-making process in which groups determine which individuals will hold public office. In certain states and countries, elections are a means for citizens to select amongst policy preferences. As Pomper writes, elections are a positive means by which groups can seek particular goals. <a href="#auto_4a987830-962f-485b-a60b-399f133bc90c_rf-55" data-type="cite">

Frequent elections are a hallmark of any representative democracy because they allow representatives of government to understand the will of the people and give people the opportunity to select these representatives and policies based on their preferences. As Madison writes in <em data-effect="italics">Federalist</em> 52, “Frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured.” <a href="#auto_4a987830-962f-485b-a60b-399f133bc90c_rf-56" data-type="cite">

  </div>
</a> In other words, if voters are expected to depend upon and trust their representatives, frequent elections are necessary to ensure the government understands the electorate’s needs. Elections can also be seen as competitions where interest groups and political parties use their resources to convince groups of voters to vote for certain candidates over others. <a href="#auto_4a987830-962f-485b-a60b-399f133bc90c_rf-57" data-type="cite">

</a> The competitive nature of elections allows voters to “comparison shop,” and forces candidates to be open about their objectives and plans. Competitive elections encourage voters to make electoral decisions, and these collective decisions should work to move elected officials in one direction over another in order to maintain their roles. </p><div data-type="note" id="auto_4a987830-962f-485b-a60b-399f133bc90c_eip-idm369940672" class="what-do"><span data-type="title">Social Responsibility and Elections</span>

This link is particularly clear-cut when studying elections, since elections give us the opportunity to directly take part in the democratic process through a particular form of civic engagement: voting. Voting, however, is not the only form of civic engagement related to elections. Individuals can also volunteer to work at the polls on Election Day, they can work to help register voters, and they can also volunteer to support the campaign of a preferred candidate. By participating in elections, we each have a chance to have our own voices heard within the halls of power through the selection of elected officials as well as voting on referenda and constitutional amendments. Each of us should strive to understand the role we play in our own community, how our communities intersect with other communities, and the importance of engaging in the civic life of all levels of government.

In economics, the theory of <span data-type="term">adverse selection</span> refers to the idea that sellers and not buyers have the upper hand when it comes to information, especially when it comes to product quality. For example, when a family goes to a dog breeder to select a puppy, they tend to know relatively little about the puppy’s lineage, what kind of environment it was born or raised in, and what the puppy is like day-to-day. The family has only limited information to help them decide which puppy to select, much as limited information impairs voters’ ability to make choices about policies and candidates. For example, a recent ballot initiative in California asked voters to decide if drivers of ride-share services such as Uber and Lyft are employees or contractors. The two companies spent $205 million dollars to persuade voters to exempt them from treating their drivers as workers. <a href="#auto_4a987830-962f-485b-a60b-399f133bc90c_rf-58" data-type="cite">

Michael Hiltzik, “With Prop 22, Uber and Lyft used their wealth to reshape labor law in their sole interest,” <em data-effect="italics">LA Times</em>, November 4, 2020.
  </div>
</a> Since voters cannot fully educate themselves on everything they must vote on, the information asymmetry can often benefit the candidate, or in this case, the companies that can spend the most on communicating with potential voters. This example also sheds light on the problematic costs of elections. As mentioned previously, the last presidential election cost $14 billion dollars, all to persuade voters to cast a ballot a certain way. As we will discuss later in the chapter, how and when elections occur varies in countries around the world, but the high cost of elections is uniquely an American problem. Elections also shed light on the problems of moral hazard. In terms of elections, a <span data-type="term">moral hazard</span> is the risk a voter takes that a chosen candidate may not, once elected, act in the way the voter hopes, or as Pomper notes, “Elections have been held harmful because they actually promote the unqualified.” In this way, voting is an act of faith and one that may bring you, the voter, risk or disappointment down the road, particularly if a voter decides to take a chance on a candidate without experience, or a candidate who performs well in an election but is not necessarily equipped to govern. Voters may consciously or subconsciously react to the problems of adverse selection and moral hazards by not voting at all.

<span data-type="term">Voter turnout</span> refers to the number of eligible voters who cast a ballot in an election. Note that there is a difference between <span data-type="term">eligible voters</span> and <span data-type="term">registered voters</span>. Eligible voters are those United States citizens who are aged eighteen and older and meet state residency requirements and rules, including state regulations on who needs to register to vote. The number of registered voters in the United States is lower than the number of eligible voters, and the number of registered voters who actually vote is lower still. The number of adults who participate in elections in the United States in the last twenty years hovered only between a low of 52% and a high of 66% in the most recent election. <a href="#auto_4a987830-962f-485b-a60b-399f133bc90c_rf-59" data-type="cite">

These include the frequency of elections, off-year elections, holding elections on weekdays, and voter registration rules. <a href="#auto_4a987830-962f-485b-a60b-399f133bc90c_rf-61" data-type="cite">

  </div>
</a> The frequency of elections leads to what some call “<span data-type="term">voter fatigue</span>,” whereby the demands of multiple elections leave voters feeling apathetic or disengaged. With presidential elections every four years, congressional elections every two years, plus a multitude of local, state, and special elections, Americans face too many choices too many times. Subsequent studies have supported the claim that the frequency of elections depressed voter turnout in other countries as well. <a href="#auto_4a987830-962f-485b-a60b-399f133bc90c_rf-62" data-type="cite">

</a> In the United States, there is also a marked drop-off in participation during off-year elections, which is when there is no presidential race but only state and local races. Some suggest that an <span data-type="term">election day holiday</span>, where voting day is a national holiday or voters vote on a weekend, would boost turnout in the United States, where election days are typically held during the week when most people have work or school commitments, whereas countries such as Japan vote on Sundays. <span data-type="term">Voter registration requirements</span>, a set of conditions voters must meet and be able to prove in order to be eligible to vote, is also often cited as another reason for low voter participation in the United States. Unlike in other countries, such as Japan, China, and most of Europe and South America, voter registration is not compulsory in the United States. Many argue that leaving the onus of registration to the voter prevents easy access to the polls. Voter registration requirements also vary widely across states. Twenty-one states allow individuals to register and vote on the same day, while five states have automatic voter registration systems. The remaining states require voters to register anywhere between a week to thirty days prior to the election. <a href="#auto_4a987830-962f-485b-a60b-399f133bc90c_rf-63" data-type="cite">

As we discussed in Chapter 5, social capital refers to the relationships forged in political and other social networks that help citizens resolve collective problems. Communities with higher social capital enjoy lower levels of crime and higher levels of trust in government. <a href="#auto_4a987830-962f-485b-a60b-399f133bc90c_rf-64" data-type="cite">

  <p id="auto_4a987830-962f-485b-a60b-399f133bc90c_fs-idm226986384">Elections are formal decision-making processes in which groups determine which individuals will hold public office. Elections are a vital part of democracy that rests on the idea of popular will, since they are the mechanism by which people express their preferences, and they are one of the most important ways people influence politicians to move in one direction or the other in terms of policy. Elections face problems in that sometimes voters do not have all the required information to make decisions that best represent their interests. Moneyed interests can have a heavy influence on election outcomes, and the people’s will can be misrepresented when political actors choose to make decisions that differ from the voters’ intentions. Relative to other countries, America has a low voter turnout, whereby the number of people registered to vote do not actually turn out on election day to cast a ballot. There are a variety of reasons for this fact, including voter fatigue, the lack of an election day holiday, onerous registration requirements, and low levels of social capital. </p>

The United States House of Representatives, state legislatures, and local governments all have their own districts from which a single representative is elected, though this was not always the case. At the writing of the Constitution, Article I, Section 4 simply stated that both Congress and state legislatures would determine how elections for members of congress would occur. Congress first passed the law dictating that House members be elected by district in 1842, and by 1872 they had expanded its scope, articulating the need for equal districts. <a href="#auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_rf-70" data-type="cite">

</a> In the case of the United States Senate, each state is the equivalent of a district, though each state obviously has different numbers of residents. When the Constitution was drafted, state legislatures elected Senators, but by 1913 the seventeenth amendment was passed and ratified in order to allow the election of Senators by direct popular vote. <a href="#auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_rf-71" data-type="cite">

</a> The president of the United States is elected through the Electoral College, a system of electors the number of which is equal to the total number of Senators (two from each state) and House members, plus electors from Washington, DC. <a href="#auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_rf-72" data-type="cite">

Washington, DC has three electoral votes while other U.S. territories have none. 
  </div>
</a> Each state is a district. States choose electors using different methods including state conventions, state party central committees, appointment by state governors, state primary, or nomination by the party’s candidate. Electors are expected to vote on behalf of their party and according to the popular vote. However, as we have seen in recent elections, the winner of the popular vote is not always the winner of the Electoral College. <a href="#auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_rf-73" data-type="cite">

Five presidents have lost the popular vote and won the Electoral College: John Quincy Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Benjamin Harrison, George H. Bush, and Donald Trump.
  </div>
</a> This is because, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, states utilize a “winner-take-all” approach to allocating electoral votes. This means that no matter the margin, the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state wins all of that state’s Electoral College votes. Maine and Nebraska allocate one electoral vote to each of their congressional districts, and the winner of each of those districts is awarded one electoral vote. The winner of the state-wide vote is then awarded the state's remaining two electoral votes. This allocation of Electoral College votes is referred to as the <span data-type="term">Congressional District Method</span>. </p><p id="auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_eip-537">Most American elections are won by <span data-type="term">plurality rule</span>, whereby the candidate with the most votes wins. Some states, such as Georgia, require candidates for state-wide office to win at least 50 percent of the vote, which is called <span data-type="term">majority rule</span>. If a candidate cannot secure 50 percent of the vote, the election goes into what is called a run-off election, where the field of candidates is whittled down to a smaller number and the election is held again.

</figure><p id="auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_eip-996">The main alternative to plurality rule is <span data-type="term">proportional representation</span>, a concept that is often suggested as an alternative to the “winner-take-all” approach of the Electoral College. In proportional representation, the proportional breakdown of votes cast by the electorate for each party determines what proportion of the governing body is made up of members of those parties. In other words, if one party were to win 60% of the vote and another party were to win 40%, the government would consist of 60% of the first party and 40% of the other. Notably, America does not employ proportional representation at any level of elections, and according to Doverger’s Law, this is the reason why the United States also still has only two main parties; plurality rule encourages a dichotomous party system whereas proportional representation encourages multiple parties to form. <a href="#auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_rf-74" data-type="cite">

This is due in part to the idea behind the federal system of American government, which balances power between the federal government and the states. As such, the states are free to oversee their own election processes, so long as they do not violate existing federal laws or state statutes. For example, Oregon has used mail-in ballots since 1998, where all registered voters receive ballots three weeks before election day. <a href="#auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_rf-76" data-type="cite">

</a> States also differ in other methods and regulations around voting. For example, recent proposed changes in the Georgia legislature will make Sunday voting more difficult for Georgians wishing to cast early votes. This type of regulation is decided at the state level, though opponents allege that this measure is aimed squarely at minimizing African-American turnout since historically, southern churches have encouraged their congregants to vote on Sundays.<a href="#auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_rf-78" data-type="cite">

More specifically, Congressional agencies are tasked with regulating or overseeing campaign finance, election administration, election security, redistricting, qualifications and contested elections, and voting rights, though the primary role of administering elections is left to the states and their jurisdictions, reflecting the American tenets of federalism. While the Election Assistance Commission and Federal Election Commission are two federal agencies devoted to overseeing campaigns and elections, the Justice Department administers and enforces some election statutes.

</a> Poll workers make sure that people who vote can check in and provide ID (in some states). They share important information about how to fill out ballots and make sure the voting process moves smoothly. Anywhere that serves as a polling station (in other words, a place to vote) needs poll workers. Most states provide training and payment for these important positions, but a lack of poll workers is an ongoing problem for many local jurisdictions. Non-profit organizations such as All Voting Is Local train and recruit poll workers to ensure fair election practices and to encourage all Americans to participate in their democracy. <a href="#auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_rf-81" data-type="cite">

Election rules differ around the globe. In comparison to the United States, France imposes very strict regulations on how elections are run. In France, elections themselves are very brief (two weeks leading up to the casting of ballots and one week in between two separate ballots), and all media involving campaigns can only be aired during a three-month run up to an election. In addition, starting from the night before polls open, it is illegal to publish or broadcast by any type of communication that can be categorized as electoral propaganda. However, television stations can show candidates voting (along with other citizens) as long as all candidates in the election are also included, and provided no candidate transmits any sort of campaign message on camera. French law also prohibits the media from publishing, broadcasting or commenting on any kind of electoral poll. Finally, election results, even partial ones, cannot be published or broadcast before the last polling place closes on Sunday. <a href="#auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_rf-83" data-type="cite">

A prime minister might call a snap election on the back of good news, for example, in order to bolster his or her majority within the parliament. Elections in the United Kingdom are also short compared to those in the United States. Tony Blair, the leader of the Labor Party, famously announced his candidacy for prime minister one month before the election. <a href="#auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_rf-85" data-type="cite">

</a> Unlike the fixed election calendar America follows, the system in the United Kingdom is more flexible; parliament is “dissolved” after five years and twenty-five days before a general election. However, as stated previously, these elections can be called at any time during a prime minister’s term. Citizens in the United Kingdom vote for Ministers of Parliament (MPs) from their district, and the party with the most seats elects the prime minister from amongst their ranks. However, the prime minister is officially appointed by the Queen, though she typically follows the majority party’s vote choice for who should fill the role. <a href="#auto_fd53a315-b34a-443a-96bb-acff6835264f_rf-86" data-type="cite">

Members of the House and Senate are voted in directly by the people, whereas the president is elected through the Electoral College. Elections are won either by plurality rule (most votes) or majority rule (at least half).      Ballot initiatives and referendums represent direct democracy where people select policy preferences rather than relying on elected officials to vote on them. Some consider them a more democratic form of participation. In the U.S., the federal government plays a limited role in administering elections, leaving the states to create their own rules and regulations in terms of when people can vote and how. Elections are run differently around the world. In many countries, voter registration is automatic, and in some countries it is even compulsory. While election day is a fixed day on the U.S. calendar, in other countries elections can be called at any time.
