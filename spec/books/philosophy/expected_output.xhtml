The authors take a balanced approach to micro-and macroeconomics, to both Keynesian and classical views, and to the theory and application of economics concepts. The text also includes many current examples, which are handled in a politically equitable way. The second edition has been thoroughly revised to increase clarity, update data and current event impacts, and incorporate the feedback from many reviewers and adopters. </p>

These knowledgeable instructors informed the pedagogical courses, learning objective development and fulfillment, and the chapter arrangements. Faculty who taught from the material provided critical and detailed commentary.</p>

          <ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-679">
            <li><strong>What is Economics?</strong>  The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on making choices in a world of scarce resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Supply and Demand</strong>, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.</li>
            <li><strong>The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory</strong>, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics portion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different models of market structure, including some simple game theory.</li>
            <li><strong>Microeconomic Policy Issues</strong>, Chapters 11 through 18, covers the range of topics in applied micro, framed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities.  Students explore competition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor market issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, as well as public economy.</li>
            <li><strong>The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals</strong>, Chapters 19 through 23, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows.</li>
            <li><strong>A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis</strong>, Chapters 24 through 26, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.  The model is then applied to the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives.  The expenditure-output model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.</li>
            <li><strong>Monetary and Fiscal Policy</strong>, Chapters 27 through 31, explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary policy and financial regulation.  Then the discussion switches to government deficits and fiscal policy.</li>
            <li><strong>International Economics</strong>, Chapters 32 through 34, the final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 data-type="title">Changes to the second edition</h4>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-272">OpenStax only undertakes revisions when significant modifications to a text are necessary. In the case of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, we received a wealth of constructive feedback.  Many of the book&#x2019;s users felt that consequential movement in economic data, coupled with the impacts of national and global events, warranted a full revision. We also took advantage of the opportunity to improve the writing and sequencing of the text, as well as many of the calculation examples. The major changes are summarized below.</p>
          <ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-447">
            <li>Augmented explanations in chapters one through four provide a more comprehensive and informative foundation for the book. </li>
            <li>A clearer explanation, using a numerical example, has been given for finding the utility maximizing combination of goods and services a consumer should choose.</li>
            <li>The Theory of Production has been added to the chapter on costs &amp; industry structure.</li>
            <li> A more complete treatment has been given to labor markets, including the theories of competitive and monopsonistic labor markets, and bilateral monopoly; and the labor markets chapter and the poverty and
economic inequality chapter have been resequenced.</li>
            <li>Substantial revisions to the AD/AS model in chapters 24-26 present the core concepts of macroeconomics in a clearer, more dynamic manner. </li>
            <li>Case studies and examples have been revised and, in some cases, replaced to provide more relevant and useful information for students.</li>
            <li>Economic data, tables, and graphs, as well as discussion and analysis around that data, have been thoroughly updated.</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-318">Wherever possible, data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) was included and referenced.  In most of these uses, links to the direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged to explore the information and the overall FRED resources more thoroughly.

</p>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-594">Additional updates and revisions appear throughout the book.  They reflect changes to economic realities and policies regarding international trade, taxation, insurance, and other topics.  For issues that may change in the months or years following the textbook's publication, the authors often provided a more open-ended explanation, but we will update the text annually to address further changes. </p>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-204">The revision of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> was undertaken by Steven Greenlaw (University of Mary Washington) and David Shapiro (Pennsylvania State University), with significant input by lead reviewer Daniel MacDonald (California State University, San Bernardino).</p>

          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-987">Throughout the OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, you will find new features that engage the students in economic inquiry by taking selected topics a step further. Our features include:
</p>
          <ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-213">
            <li><strong>Bring It Home:</strong> This added feature is a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter&#x2019;s main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts:  the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the intro module) and the second at chapter&#x2019;s end, when students have learned what&#x2019;s necessary to understand the case and &#x201C;bring home&#x201D; the chapter&#x2019;s core concepts.</li>
            <li><strong>Work It Out:</strong> This added feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them step by step to find out how its solution is derived. </li>
            <li><strong>Clear It Up:</strong> This boxed feature, which includes pre-existing features from Taylor&#x2019;s text, addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts with a question.  The rest of the feature explains the answer.</li>
            <li><strong>Link It Up:</strong> This added feature is a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students&#x2019; understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.  </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 data-type="title">Questions for each level of learning</h4>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-454">The OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> further expands on Taylor&#x2019;s original end of chapter materials by offering four types of end of module questions for students:
</p>
          <ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-284">
            <li><strong>Self-Checks</strong> are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They &#x201C;click to reveal&#x201D; an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think beyond what is said in the text.  Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through the problem.  </li>
            <li><strong>Review Questions</strong> have been retained from Taylor&#x2019;s version, and are simple recall questions from the chapter in open-response format (not multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text. </li>
            <li><strong>Critical Thinking Questions</strong> are new higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to <em data-effect="italics">demonstrate their understanding by applying</em> what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for outside-the-box thinking, for <em data-effect="italics">reasoning</em> about the concepts. They push the student to places they wouldn&#x2019;t have thought of going themselves.  </li>
            <li><strong>Problems</strong> are exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and computational concepts in the module. </li>
          </ul>

For most college students, an Introduction to Philosophy course will be the first time they are exposed to the study of <span data-type="term" group-by="p" id="auto_page_11e6c843-708f-437b-bf17-eed715a9750f_term1">philosophy</span> as an academic discipline. Unlike many other courses in the liberal arts curriculum, philosophy is not something usually covered in high school. Yet, most students will be familiar with the term &#x201C;philosophy&#x201D; and may have some preconceived notion of what philosophy is and what philosophers do.

            <p id="auto_11e6c843-708f-437b-bf17-eed715a9750f_eip-609">The goal of this chapter is to provide a brief introduction to the field of philosophy as a historical and academic endeavor. Herein you will find some examples from the history of philosophy and a definition of philosophy, along with a general survey of contemporary philosophy. This first chapter prepares you for your philosophy course and gives you a better idea of what it means to be a philosopher. As with all introductions, this one is just a start. Your job is to explore more, think more, read more, and write more like a philosopher. Soon you may even find that you are doing philosophy.</p>

It is difficult to define philosophy. In fact, to do so is a philosophical activity, since philosophers are attempting to gain the broadest and most fundamental conception of the world as it exists. This world includes nature, the mind, morality, beauty, and social organizations. Plato, one of the most important ancient Greek philosophers, makes this point in a famous passage of his book, <em data-effect="italics">The Republic</em>. When describing the kind of knowledge necessary for philosophy, Plato suggests that one must move beyond the hypotheses or suppositions of the other sciences (in particular, mathematics) to grasp a genuine starting point or axiom of knowledge (509d-511e). Plato means that if you genuinely study philosophy, you ought to study things without making any assumptions about their nature or kind. Whereas other disciplines allow for basic assumptions about their specific subject-matter, philosophers can&#x2019;t be bound by such assumptions. This open-endedness makes philosophy a somewhat awkward and confusing subject for most students. There are no easy answers to these questions: What does philosophy study, and how does one do philosophy? Nevertheless, in this chapter, we can make some progress on these questions by (1) looking at past examples of philosophers, (2) considering some compelling definitions of philosophy, and (3) looking at the way academic philosophers today actually practice philosophy.

          <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-63">
The historical origins of philosophical thinking and exploration varied around the globe. The word &#x201C;philosophy&#x201D; derives from ancient Greek, in which the philosopher is a lover or pursuer (<em data-effect="italics">philia</em>) of wisdom (<em data-effect="italics">sophia</em>). But the earliest Greek philosophers were not known as philosophers; they were simply known as sages or wise men; and they were all men. There are some examples of ancient Greek women who made contributions to philosophy and poetry, but Greece was a patriarchal society that did not provide educational opportunities for women. This designation of wise man was common in many places in the world, so the ancient sage tradition provides an early glimpse of philosophical thought in action.

            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-56">
In classical Indian philosophy and religion, sages play a central role in both religious mythology and in the practice of passing down teaching and instruction through generations. Seven Sages, or <span data-type="term" group-by="S" id="auto_page_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_term2">Saptarishi</span> (seven &#x201C;rishis&#x201D; in the Sanskrit language), play an important role in <span data-type="term" group-by="s" id="auto_page_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_term3"><em data-effect="italics">sanatana dharma</em></span>, the eternal duties that have come to be identified with Hinduism but that predate the establishment of the religion. The Seven Sages are partially considered wise men and are said to be the authors of the ancient Indian texts known as the Vedas. But they are partly mythic figures as well, who are said to have descended from the gods and whose reincarnation marks the passing of each age of Manu (age of man or epoch of humanity). These sages are not only authors and figures in the classical Indian philosophical and religious texts, but they also are considered to be spiritual and personal guides. The rishis tended to live monastic lives and together they are thought of as the spiritual and practical forerunners of Indian gurus or teachers, even up until modern times. They derive their wisdom, in part, from spiritual forces, but also from tapas, or the meditative, ascetic, and spiritual practices they perform to gain control over their bodies and minds. Rishis are often portrayed as living in an ashram, or spiritual community, which is like a monastery. The stories of the rishis are part of the teachings that constitute spiritual and philosophical practice in contemporary Hinduism.

            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-31">In similar fashion, the sage (<em data-effect="italics">sheng</em>) tradition is important for Chinese philosophy. Confucius, one of the greatest Chinese writers of the rationalist age of thought, often refers to ancient sages, emphasizing the importance of sages for their discovery of technical skills essential to human civilization, for their role as rulers and wise leaders, and for their wisdom. This emphasis is in alignment with the Confucian appeal to a well-ordered state under the guidance of a &#x201C;philosopher-king.&#x201D; This point of view can be seen in early sage figures identified by Han Feizi, one of the greatest classical authors in the Chinese legalist tradition, as the &#x201C;Nest Builder&#x201D; and &#x201C;Fire Maker&#x201D; or, in another case, the &#x201C;Flood Controller.&#x201D; These names attach particular, wise individuals to early technological discoveries. Early artisans are also identified as sages, such as the creators of carts and boats. The <em data-effect="italics">Book of Changes</em>, a classical Chinese text, identifies the Five mythic Emperors as sages, including Yao and Shun, who are said to have built canoes and oars, attached carts to oxen, built double gates for defense, and fashioned bows and arrows (Cheng 1981&#x2013;1986). Emperor Shun is also said to have ruled during the time of a great flood, when all of China was submerged. Y&#xFC; is credited with having saved civilization by building canals and dams. </p>
            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-688">These figures are likely a mix of historical individuals and mythic ancestors. They are praised not only for their political wisdom and long rule, but also for their filial piety and devotion to work. For instance, Mencius, a Confucian philosopher, relates a story of Shun&#x2019;s care for his blind father and wicked stepmother, while Y&#xFC; is praised for his selfless devotion to work. In these ways, the Chinese philosophical traditions, such as Confucianism and Mohisism, associate key values of their philosophical enterprises with the great sages of their history. So the Chinese sage tradition seems to present a mix of real political figures, artisans who discovered key technologies necessary for building civilization, totemic beasts associated with the identity of tribes, and divine creatures that are more god than human. </p>

            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-297">Perhaps these various characterizations can be unified in terms of a narrative account of the origin story of people and cultures. The sages represent a kind of godlike wisdom and virtue that enabled the core behaviors and technologies central to success of civilization. Whether the sages were, in fact, historical men or, as many scholars have concluded, mythical forebearers, they possessed the essential human virtue of listening and responding to divine voices. This attribute can be inferred from the Chinese script, for <em data-effect="italics">sheng</em>, which bears the symbol of an ear as a prominent feature. So the sage is one who listens to insight from the heavens and then is capable of sharing that wisdom or acting upon it to the benefit of his society (Cheng 1981&#x2013;1986). This idea is similar to one found in the Indian tradition, where the most important texts, the Vedas, are known as <em data-effect="italics">shruti</em>, or works that were heard through divine revelation and only later written down.</p>
            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-697">A detailed and important study of the sage tradition in Africa is provided by Henry Odera Oruka (1991), who identifies two types of African sages: folk sages and philosophical sages. Oruka makes the case that prominent folk figures in African tribal history developed complex philosophical ideas. Unfortunately, these ideas are often overlooked or dismissed as unsophisticated by prominent European philosophers. Oruka interviewed tribal Africans identified by their communities as sages, and he recorded their sayings and ideas, confining himself to those sayings that demonstrated &#x201C;a rational method of inquiry into the real nature of things&#x201D; (Oruka 1991, 150). He recognized a tension in what made these sages philosophically interesting: they articulated the received wisdom of their tradition and culture while at the same time maintaining a critical distance from that culture, seeking a rational justification for the beliefs held by the culture. </p>

            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-544">Among the ancient Greeks, it was common to identify seven sages. Though there are different accounts, we will follow Diogenes La&#xEB;rtius, whose text, <em data-effect="italics">The Lives, Opinions, and Remarkable Sayings of the Most Famous Ancient Philosophers</em>, is a canonical resource on early Greek philosophy. The first and most important sage is Thales of Miletus. Thales traveled to Egypt to study with the Egyptian priests, where he became one of the first Greeks to learn astronomy. He is known for bringing back to Greece knowledge of the calendar, dividing the year into 365 days, tracking the progress of the sun from solstice to solstice, and&#x2014;somewhat dramatically&#x2014;predicting a solar eclipse in 585 BCE. The eclipse occurred on the day of a battle between the Medes and Lydians. It is possible that Thales used knowledge of Babylonian astronomical records to guess the year and location of the eclipse. This mathematical and astronomical feat is one of Thales&#x2019;s several claims to sagehood. In addition, he is said to have calculated the height of the pyramids, using the basic geometry of similar triangles and measuring the shadow at a certain time of day. He is also reported to have predicted a particularly good year for olives: he bought up all the olive presses and then made a fortune selling those presses to farmers wanting to turn their olives into oil. Together, these scientific and technical achievements suggest that at least part of Thales&#x2019;s wisdom can be attributed to a very practical, scientific, and mathematical knowledge of the natural world. If that was all Thales was known for, he might be called the first scientist or engineer. But he also made more basic claims about the nature and composition of the universe; for instance, he claimed that all matter was fundamentally made of up water, arguing that all things that moved on their own possessed a soul and that the soul itself was immortal. These claims demonstrate a concern about the fundamental nature of reality. </p>
            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-707">Another of the seven sages was Solon, a famed political leader. He introduced the &#x201C;Law of Release&#x201D; to Athens, which cancelled all personal debts and freed indentured servants or &#x201C;debt-slaves&#x201D; who had been consigned to service based on a personal debt they were unable to repay. In addition, he established a constitutional government in Athens with a representative body, a procedure for taxation, and a series of economic reforms. He was widely admired as a political leader but voluntarily stepped down so that he would not become a tyrant. He was finally forced to flee Athens when he was unable to persuade the members of the Assembly (the ruling body) to resist the rising tyranny of one of his relatives, Pisistratus. When he arrived in exile, he was reportedly asked whom he considered to be happy, to which he replied, &#x201C;One ought to count no man happy until he is dead.&#x201D; Aristotle interpreted this statement to mean that happiness was not a momentary experience, but a quality of someone&#x2019;s entire life.</p>
            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-984">The remaining five sages have fewer triumphs and sayings attributed to them. Chilon was a lyric poet known for having declared that the best human beings use their reason to divine the future. He is known for aphorisms that counsel people to follow the law, control anger, and &#x201C;let not your tongue outrun your thought,&#x201D; and he added, &#x201C;the character of human beings is tested by gold.&#x201D; Pittacus is known for his triumphs in war and, subsequently, government. He vanquished a tyrant from the Greek island of Lesbos and guided his city, Mitylene, in battle against the Athenians. Afterward, he was honored by being elected governor of the city, where he established constitutional rule of law and stepped down peacefully after ten years of rule. One of the laws he implemented was to impose double the penalty for a crime on people convicted of committing that crime in a state of intoxication. Given the abundance of wine on his island, he wanted to discourage drunkenness. </p>
            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-520">Bias of Priene (c. 570 BCE) was thought to have come from a poor household. Yet, when he earned money, he used it to rescue women who had been captured in war and sold for ransom. He adopted them as his daughters, gave them dowries, and returned them to their fathers. He was known for having been a clever, and sometimes deceptive, defense lawyer. In one case, he saved his city from attack by convincing the opposing king that the city was full of strong, well-fed citizens. This caused the king to retreat and agree to a peace treaty. </p>
            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-372">Cleobulus was known for his strength and beauty and was trained in Egyptian philosophy, like Thales. He wrote songs and riddles and is said to have rebuilt the temple of Athena. Periander of Corinth is unlike the other sages, in that he ruled as a tyrant for forty years and is said to have had a violent temper, killing his wife after being provoked into a rage by gossip from his concubines. He later burned the concubines alive after he discovered their lies and banished his son because he was annoyed by his mourning. Even though he was a tyrant, Periander thought that democracy was better than tyranny and that the pursuit of money for its own sake was undesirable. However, he was deeply concerned about his own safety, becoming one of the first to establish a permanent bodyguard and only selectively allowing people to enter his city. La&#xEB;rtius attributes Periander&#x2019;s decision to remain a tyrant to his paranoia; the author of <em data-effect="italics">Lives</em> says Periander chose to consolidate power in order to protect himself.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">Beginnings of Natural Philosophy</h4>
            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-927">
The sage tradition is a largely prehistoric tradition that provides a narrative about how intellect, wisdom, piety, and virtue lead to the innovations central to flourishing of ancient civilizations. Particularly, as we have seen in Greece, the sage tradition blends into a period of natural philosophy, where individuals try to explain nature using rational methods. 
</p>
            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-220">Several of the early Greek schools of philosophy were centered on their respective views of nature. Followers of Thales, known as the <span data-type="term" group-by="M" id="auto_page_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_term4">Milesians</span>, were particularly interested in the underlying causes of natural change. Why does water turn to ice? What happens when the winter passes into spring? Why does is seem like the stars and planets orbit the earth in predictable patterns? From Aristotle we know that Thales thought there was a difference between material elements that participate in change and elements that contain their own source of motion. Of course, this early use of the term &#x201C;element&#x201D; did not have the same meaning as the scientific meaning of the word today in a field like chemistry. Thales thought material elements bear some fundamental connection to water in that they have the capacity to move and alter their state. By contrast, other elements had their own internal source of motion, of which he cites the magnet and amber (two elements that exhibit forces of static electricity when rubbed against other materials). He said that these elements have &#x201C;soul.&#x201D; This notion of soul, as a principle of internal motion, was influential across ancient and medieval natural philosophy. In fact, the English language words &#x2018;animal&#x2019; and &#x2018;animation&#x2019; are derived from the Latin word for soul (<em data-effect="italics">anima</em>). Anaximander, another Milesian philosopher, theorized that instead of originating from some material principle, all changes come from some unformed source and that coming into being and passing away are governed by a kind of justice.</p>
            <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-398">Similarly, early thinkers like Xenophanes began to formulate explanations for natural phenomena. For instance, he explained rainbows, the sun, the moon, and St Elmo&#x2019;s fire (luminous, electrical discharges) as apparitions of the clouds. This form of explanation, describing some apparent phenomenon as the result of an underlying mechanism, is paradigmatic of scientific explanation even today. Parmenides, the founder of the Eleatic school of philosophers, used logic to conclude that whatever fundamentally exists must be unchanging because if it every did change, then at least some aspect of it would cease to exist. But that notion would imply that what exists could not exist&#x2014;which seems to defy logic. Parmenides is not saying that that there is no change, but that the changes we observe are a kind of illusion. Indeed, this point of view was highly influential, not only for Plato and Aristotle, but also for the early atomists, like Democritus, who held that all perceived qualities are merely human conventions. Underlying all these appearances are only atomic, unchanging bits of matter flowing through a void. While this ancient Greek view of atoms is quite different from the modern model of atoms, the very idea that every observable phenomenon has a basis in underlying pieces of matter in various configurations has a long tradition. Moreover, this tradition has informed logic, philosophy, and science.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">How it all Hangs Together</h3>
          <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-236">
In 1962, Wilfrid Sellars, a highly influential twentieth-century philosopher, wrote a book chapter called, &#x201C;Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man,&#x201D; in <em data-effect="italics">Frontiers of Science and Philosophy</em>. He opens the essay with a dramatic and concise description of philosophy: &#x201C;The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term.&#x201D; The introductory section of the chapter explains what is meant by this sentence. Sellars defines the philosophical method as a kind of know-how (a practical, engaged type of knowledge, similar to riding a bike or learning to swim). This is partly why philosophers find it difficult to describe the philosophical method. Philosophical know-how, Sellars says, has to do with knowing your way around the conceptual universe and understanding and thinking about how things in general connect, link up, support, and rely upon one another&#x2014;in short, how things hang together. Sellars thinks that this philosophical project is most clearly demonstrated when we try to understand the connection between the natural world as we experience it directly (the &#x201C;manifest image&#x201D;) and the natural world as science explains it (the &#x201C;scientific image&#x201D;). He suggests that we gain an understanding of the nature of philosophy by trying to reconcile these two pictures of the world that most people understand independently.

</li>
                <li>What is the scientific image of man in the world? What is the manifest image of man in the world? How are they different? And why are these two images the primary images that need to be brought into focus so that philosophy may gain an eye on the whole?

          <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_eip-518">Unlike other subjects that have clearly defined subject-matter boundaries and relatively clear methods of exploration and analysis, philosophy intentionally lacks clear boundaries or methods. For instance, your biology textbook will tell you that biology is the &#x201C;science of life.&#x201D; The boundaries of biology are fairly clear: it is an experimental science that studies living things and the associated material necessary for life. Similarly, biology has relatively well-defined methods. As you may have learned, biologists, like other experimental scientists, broadly follow something that people call the &#x201C;scientific method.&#x201D; This is a bit of a misnomer, unfortunately, because there is no single method that all the experimental sciences follow. Nevertheless, biologists have a range of methods and practices, including observation, experimentation, and theory comparison and analysis that are fairly well established and well known among practitioners. Philosophy doesn&#x2019;t have such easy prescriptions&#x2014;and for good reason. Philosophers are interested in gaining the broadest possible understanding of things, whether that be nature, the supernatural, morals, aesthetics, political organizations, or any other field or concept.</p>

            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-99">
Let&#x2019;s start with a basic but underappreciated source of evidence in philosophy: the history of philosophy. As we have already seen, philosophical thinking has its origins in Greece, India, China, and Africa thousands of years ago. From the earliest times, philosophers, sages, natural philosophers, and religious thinkers have considered philosophical questions. Their work is often a great source of insight, inspiration, and argument that can help us understand contemporary philosophical questions. In this textbook, you will frequently find examples of the connection between historical writing on a philosophical topic and more contemporary concerns. For instance, the Greeks recognized early on that there is a difference between the way language talks about phenomena, using generic terms that apply to many different types of things (like cat, tree, or house), and phenomena that actually exist, namely, as specific, individual beings or specific objects. Philosophers ask, what is the relationship between the general terms we use and the specific things that exist in the world? This sort of question is a perennial philosophical question. Today&#x2019;s philosophers have their own response to this sort of question, and their answers often respond to and are informed by the historical treatment of these issues.
</p>
            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-218">While most people would expect questions about the natural world to change over time (and certainly they have changed due to scientific progress), questions of morality and social organization do not appear to change as much. What constitutes the good life? How should communities be organized to benefit all the members of that community? These sorts of questions stay with us throughout time. In the United States, it is common for political leaders to appeal to the &#x201C;founding fathers&#x201D; of the US Constitution. People like Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington were heavily influenced by early modern European philosophers like John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Thomas Hobbes. In similar fashion, the current Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, is fond of reading and citing the foundational philosopher Confucius. Most of Xi&#x2019;s addresses include quotations from Confucius, and he is very vocal about the importance of reading classical Chinese philosophers (Zhang 2015). For Chinese political leaders, Confucius provides an important reminder of the role of virtue and a sense of belonging among the Chinese people. There is a widespread belief among the Chinese political class that their intellectual heritage is an important factor in their contemporary political success, in much the same way as American political leaders trace their success back to the founding fathers. Given the influence of philosophy on world history, it is worthwhile to engage with the writings of past philosophers to inform your understanding of the pressing philosophical questions of today&#x2019;s societies. </p>

            <h4 data-type="title">Intuition</h4>
            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-604">
One of the hallmarks of philosophical thinking is an appeal to <span data-type="term" group-by="i" id="auto_page_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_term5">intuition</span>. What philosophers today mean by intuition can probably best be traced back to Plato, for whom intuition (<em data-effect="italics">nous</em>) involved a kind if insight into the very nature of things. This notion has had religious connotations, as if the knowledge gained through intuition is like catching a glimpse of divine light. But intuition doesn&#x2019;t have to involve faith. R&#xE9;n&#xE9; Descartes&#x2019;s definition of intuition can be quite instructive: &#x201C;By intuition [I mean] &#x2026; the conception of a clear and attentive mind, which is so easy and distinct that there can be no room for doubt about what we are understanding&#x201D; (Descartes 1985, 14). This concept of intuition is clearest in mathematical examples. Importantly, it is quite different from the way that many people use the word &#x2018;intuition&#x2019; today to mean something like &#x2018;gut feeling&#x2019; or &#x2018;hunch.&#x2019; When philosophers talk about intuition, they mean something much more restricted and much more solid. Consider the equation 2 + 2 = 4. Examine the equation in your mind. Could it possibly be false? So long as we operate under the assumption that these numbers express counting numbers, it seems impossible that this equation could be false. More than that, there is a kind of clarity and certainty about the equation. It is not just that you have learned 2 + 2 = 4 by habit. You could easily perform the counting operation in your head and verify that the answer is correct. The truth of this mathematical sentence is so clear that if it turned out to be wrong, you would have to give up core beliefs about the nature of numbers, addition, and equality. This kind of clarity is a paradigm of intuition.
</p>
            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-557">Of course, intuition operates in other realms besides mathematics, such as in the use of language. For instance, it is obvious that a three-legged stool has three legs or that the tallest building is taller than the any other building. These statements are true in an obvious way that is similar to the mathematical sentence above. We can branch out further, to say, for instance, that a camel is a mammal. We might intuitively know this statement is true, but we may also recognize that we are on slightly less certain ground. After all, whether a camel is a mammal is based on our understanding of the anatomy of a camel as well as the biological classification system that assigns animals to different classes. So, the definition of camel as a mammal is not the same kind of statement as  &#x201C;a three-legged stool has three legs.&#x201D; Here, we can see that some statements are intuitively true by virtue of their definition. Others are intuitively true by virtue of some mental operation that we can perform very easily. Still others are intuitively true in that they rely on a body of knowledge that is commonly accepted and foundational for our understanding of the world.</p>
            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-661">There are many other places outside of pure linguistic analysis and mathematics where intuitions are helpful. Consider morality. Let&#x2019;s start with the proposition that &#x2018;it is better to be good than to be bad.&#x2019; This ought to sound similar to the statement that &#x2018;a three-legged stool has three legs,&#x2019; but the latter statement introduces the words &#x2018;good&#x2019; and &#x2018;bad,&#x2019; which are fraught terms that raise a lot of disagreement among people. While it may be difficult to agree on what constitutes &#x2018;good&#x2019; or &#x2018;bad,&#x2019; you probably recognize that whatever is good ought to be better than what is bad. That seems intuitively true. On this basis, we might imagine that there are intuitive truths even in morality. As we gain confidence in the ability of intuition to reveal truth, we might be tempted to extend intuitions even further. However, when intuitions extend into controversial areas where there is no consensus on what is true, we have to be cautious. At that point, we might be using the term &#x2018;intuition&#x2019; to stand in for &#x2018;belief&#x2019; or &#x2018;perspective.&#x2019; Such &#x201C;intuitions&#x201D; do not have the same force as the intuition that 2 + 2 = 4. It is not always easy to distinguish between intuitions that are certain and evident and those that are mere feelings or hunches. But perceiving that distinction is part of the practical know-how philosophers try to develop.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">Common Sense</h4>
            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-463">We ought not to neglect a third source of evidence in philosophy, namely, common sense. The idea of <span data-type="term" group-by="c" id="auto_page_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_term6">common sense</span> is frequently used to describe a basic set of facts or common knowledge that any adult human being ought to possess. But common sense is rarely defined. When philosophers talk about common sense, they mean very specific claims, usually about sense perception. These claims of sense perception are taken to be true in a relatively fundamental sense. In other words, philosophical champions of common sense deny that one can be skeptical of certain basic claims of sense perception.
</p>
            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-539">Famously, early twentieth-century British philosopher G. E. Moore argued that a perfectly rigorous proof of the external world could be given by simply making the appropriate gesture toward his right hand and saying, &#x201C;Here is one hand.&#x201D; So long as it is granted that the sensory perception of a hand is evidence of the existence of a hand and that there is such a thing as a hand in the external world, then it must be granted that there is an external world. Such an argument trades on the idea that knowledge of the existence of my own hands is something that does not need further proof; it is something I can know without proof. This idea is not something that all philosophers accept, but it is, in many cases, an important source of evidence in philosophical inquiry. At a certain point, it may be necessary to stop demanding proofs for the things we can plainly see, such as the fact that this is a hand (as I hold my own hand in front of my face and examine it). Common sense always can be questioned by further philosophical interrogation. But the common-sense philosopher may respond that such interrogation is either unnecessary, excessive, or misses the point.</p>

The basic idea motivating experimental philosophy is that philosophers use terms and concepts in their philosophical writing that can be tested in a laboratory. For instance, when philosophers talk about free will, they frequently cite the idea that free will is necessary to assign moral responsibility; thus, moral responsibility is the basis for the presumed existence of free will. Consequently, you might wonder whether most people do, in fact, believe that free will is necessary to assign moral responsibility. This claim can be tested, for instance, by posing problems or scenarios to research subjects and asking them whether the absence of free will removes moral responsibility. Similar strategies have been applied to causation, philosophy of biology, consciousness, personal identity, and so forth. In these areas, philosophers use experimental methods to find out what average people think about philosophical issues. Since common sense and intuition are already a source of evidence in philosophical reasoning, it makes sense to confirm that what philosophers ascribe to common sense or to intuition aligns with what people generally think about these things.

            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-933">Such experimental research is subject to many of the same issues that confront experimentation in the social sciences. These studies need to be replicable and ought to fall within a psychological or biological theory that helps explain them. When philosophers tread into experimental philosophy, they behave a lot more like scientists than philosophers, and they are held to the same rigorous standards as other researchers in similar experimental disciplines.</p>

The relevance of experimental methods for philosophy suggests a broader source of evidence for philosophical claims, namely, the results of scientific disciplines. As we have noted, when doing experimental philosophy, philosophers act like psychologists or cognitive scientists. But philosophers can also use the work of psychologists, cognitive scientists, economists, or biologists to inform their work. So, a final, fruitful source of evidence in philosophy are the results from other disciplines. When philosophers make claims about the natural world, they ought to be aware of what the natural sciences say. When philosophers make claims about human nature, they ought to be aware of what biology and the social sciences say. As we have already seen, there is an important difference between philosophical investigation and these various disciplines. Yet, given that philosophers attempt to gain some understanding of truth as a whole, they ought to welcome evidence from other disciplines that can help them better understand portions of that whole truth.

One of the first and most reliable ways that philosophers have of verifying and analyzing claims is by using <span data-type="term" group-by="l" id="auto_page_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_term8">logic</span>, which is, in some sense, the science of reasoning. Logic attempts to formalize the process that we use or ought to use when we provide reasons for some claims. By interpreting the claims we make using logic, we can assess whether those claims are well-founded and consistent, or whether they are poorly reasoned. Chapter 3 will provide much more detail about the nature of logic and how it is used by philosophers to arrive at truth.

            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-672">
The first and most important move in logic is to recognize that claims are the product of <span data-type="term" group-by="a" id="auto_page_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_term9">arguments</span>. In particular, a claim is just the conclusion of a series of sentences, where the preceding sentences (called premises) provide evidence for the conclusion. This sense of argument is not the same thing as a verbal disagreement&#x2014;and certainly not a heated or angry disagreement. In terms of logic, an argument is just a way of formalizing reasons to support a claim, where the claim is the conclusion and the reasons given are the premises. In normal conversation and even philosophical writing, arguments are rarely written so clearly that one can easily identify the premises and the conclusion. Nevertheless, it is possible to reconstruct any argument as a series of sentences with clearly identified premises and conclusions. This process is the first step in analyzing an argument: identify the claim that is being made; then identify the sentences that provide supporting evidence for the argument. This process will necessarily require some interpretation on the part of the reader. Therefore, it is important to try to remain faithful to the original intention of the argument and outline the premises and conclusions in such a way that they display the reasoning of the person making that claim.
</p>
            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-360">Once the premises and conclusion are identified and written in order, then it is possible to use formal techniques to evaluate the argument. Those techniques are defined by the field of logic, and they vary depending on the type of argument being made. Details on how to identify argument types and a basic introduction to evaluating arguments will be covered in Chapter 3.</p>

Poorly supported claims may be true, but without reasons to accept those claims, a person&#x2019;s support of them is irrational. In philosophy, we want to understand and evaluate the reasons for a claim. Just as a house that is built without a solid foundation will rapidly deteriorate and eventually fall, the philosopher who accepts claims without good reasons is likely to hold a system of beliefs that will crumble.</p>

            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-918">
While arguments can be thought of as building blocks to construct a solid foundation for beliefs about the world, arguments can also be understood as explanations for phenomena or circumstances that are evident but not well understood. To generate well-founded beliefs, we start with evidence in the form of premises and infer a conclusion from that evidence. To explain observed phenomena, we start with a conclusion and reason backward to the evidence that explains why our conclusion is true. For example, we infer that there is a fire based on the appearance of smoke, or we infer lightening when we hear thunder, even if we don&#x2019;t see the lightening. We can also compare the way we reason about the explanation of phenomena to the way a detective might reconstruct a crime based on the evidence found at a crime scene. By reconstructing the premises that led to a given conclusion, a philosopher can explain the reasons for a conclusion that are evident through observation. In summary, logical reconstruction can be used to investigate the world around us, providing a rational explanation for why the world is the way it appears.

            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-279">
Finally, logic provides philosophers with a powerful technique for assessing a set of claims or beliefs. We can ask whether a set of beliefs is logically consistent with one another. Given that we expect our beliefs to present to us a world that makes rational sense, we want those beliefs to be internally consistent. A set of beliefs or statements is <span data-type="term" group-by="c" id="auto_page_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_term10">coherent</span>, or logically consistent, if it is possible for them to all be true at the same time. If it is not possible for statements or beliefs to be true at the same time, then they are contradictory. It seems unreasonable for a person to accept contradictory claims because a contradiction is a logic impossibility. If a person holds contradictory beliefs, then they must be wrong about at least some of their beliefs. Metaphorically, the house of beliefs in which they live must be poorly founded, at least in some places. So a philosopher wants to avoid incoherence. Thus, when you are reading a philosopher, you should be aware of places where they say things that appear to be inconsistent. If you discover inconsistencies, that is a good indication that at least one of their claims is false. You may not know which claim is false, but you can know it is logically impossible for all of them to be true.
</p>
            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-9">When faced with the possibility of incoherent beliefs, the philosopher will need to either revise those beliefs so that they become consistent, or they will need to give up some beliefs to preserve others. Logical consistency cannot tell us that a set of beliefs is true. A complete fiction might be logically consistent. But logical consistency can tell us what is not true. That is, it is impossible for a logically inconsistent set of beliefs to be wholly true. </p>

          <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-56">
One of the techniques that philosophers use to clarify and understand philosophical statements (either premises or conclusions) is <span data-type="term" group-by="c" id="auto_page_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_term11">conceptual analysis</span>. Conceptual analysis involves the analysis of concepts, notions, or ideas as they are presented in statements or sentences. But what do philosophers mean by analysis? The term analysis has been a part of philosophical terminology and methodology since its beginning. In its most basic sense, analysis refers to the decomposition of complex ideas into simpler ones. Analysis also involves a cluster of related strategies that philosophers use to discover truths. Each of these techniques attempts to arrive at a clearer and more workable definition of the concepts in question.
</p>
          <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-974">When students are asked to give a definition of some concept or term, they frequently go to a dictionary. But a dictionary provides only a description of how a concept is used in ordinary speech. A dictionary cannot tell us what the word means in a fundamental sense because dictionary definitions never ask whether that common usage is coherent, accurate, or precise. It is up to the person engaged in reflection on the concept to figure out what the term means and whether that meaning fits within a larger understanding of the world.  The next section illustrates four methods of analysis, using predicates, descriptions, enumerations, and thought experiments.</p>

            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-169">
When philosophers today talk about concepts, they are usually referring to a notion that comes from the work on logic done by German philosopher Gottlob Frege. Frege demonstrated that any sentence in natural language could be translated into a formal, symbolic language, provided that we consider the sentence to be a kind of function that describes a relationship between names or objects and concepts. This symbolic language is what has become modern logic. Frege modeled his logic on mathematics, with the idea that he could eliminate the ambiguity and vagueness of the language by translating it into a purely symbolic notation. Following Frege, we can break sentences into parts, including names, or object identifiers, and concepts, or predicates.

But any sentence can be analyzed in multiple ways. And some sentences express multiple relations between predicates and objects. So the role of conceptual analysis is to identify the right predicates for analysis and to clarify the relationship between them. Predicates can help us clarify statements. For any sentence, we can ask, what is being described, and how is it being described?</p>

While the concepts that describe or categorize objects can be analyzed using predicates, the objects themselves can analyzed by using descriptions. Bertrand Russell identified definite descriptions as the way to analyze proper names or objects. His idea is that in a sentence like &#x2018;the flower is yellow&#x2019; or &#x2018;my dog likes naps,&#x2019; the subject term&#x2014;'flower&#x2019; or &#x2018;dog&#x2019;&#x2014;can be substituted with a descriptive sentence that uniquely identifies the flower or dog. There are unique characteristics that differentiate my dog from all others, for instance: my dog was born on a certain day, lives in a certain city, belongs to me, or occupies a specific location. Similarly, the flower can be identified by its position in a garden, field, or particular geographical location. One of Russell&#x2019;s insights was that proper names, such as &#x2018;Max&#x2019; (suppose it is the name I use to call my dog), are definite descriptions in disguise. That is, any proper name can be substituted with a description that picks out the one and only thing named.

This way we can clarify what we are talking about without resorting to gestures, context, or direct experience. You probably do this in your everyday life when you encounter confusion about a name or object. For instance, suppose a co-worker says, &#x201C;Kevin used up all the paper in the printer.&#x201D; If there is more than one Kevin in the office, you might answer, &#x201C;Which Kevin?&#x201D; And your coworker may then respond, &#x201C;The one with brown hair whose workspace is right next to the entrance.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; you might reply, &#x201C;You mean the one with the picture of his kids on his desk?&#x201D; In a sense, this process of disambiguating the reference for the name &#x2018;Kevin&#x2019; is a process of seeking a more definite description to supplement the proper name. Understanding that language is composed of descriptions and predicates can help us remove some of the ambiguity and vagueness that is a natural part of speech. </p>

            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-241">
Sometimes, to understand the meaning of some concept, we find it helpful to enumerate its component parts. For instance, we may say that a governmental body is composed of its legislature, its executive, and its judicial branches. Or we might recognize that a cell is composed of a nucleus, a cell wall, and organelles. The process of <span data-type="term" group-by="e" id="auto_page_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_term14">enumeration</span> can help us specify the nature of the thing we are talking about. In effect, we are identifying the parts that make up a whole. Since claims about the whole pertain to all the parts of the whole, it is necessary to verify that claims we make about the whole do, in fact, apply to each of its parts. That process requires enumeration. Just as enumeration is helpful in understanding material things, it can be used to understand abstract concepts. For example, Aristotle says that wisdom is composed of scientific knowledge, plus understanding, where understanding is the grasp of first principles and scientific knowledge is the grasp of demonstrated reasoning that follows from first principles. Whether or not Aristotle is correct, we can still use enumeration to understand the nature of wisdom.

            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-284">
When philosophers want to clarify the relationship between concepts, they may consider hypothetical scenarios meant to isolate one or more features of a concept and place it in the appropriate relationship with other concepts. Such hypothetical scenarios are often called <span data-type="term" group-by="t" id="auto_page_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_term15">thought experiments</span>. These imaginative scenarios allow us to test or compare concepts to better understand their logical consequences. Philosophers have used thought experiments for as long as we have a written record of philosophical thought. For instance, Plato devised an elaborate thought experiment in <em data-effect="italics">The Republic</em>, in which he depicts Socrates and several other characters describing an ideal city. The premise of this thought experiment is that if philosophers could describe such a city in detail, they would be able to identify which part of the city gives rise to justice.
</p>
            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-310">Aristotle, a Greek philosopher who followed Plato, demonstrates his conclusion that it is not possible for there to be a void or empty space between matter by constructing a thought experiment that assumes such a void. He then asks, how could one know the distance between two points without any matter to measure that distance? If there is any distance between two points, Aristotle reasons, that distance would have to be the property of something. But, by hypothesis, there is nothing between the objects: it is a pure vacuum. Aristotle bases his reasoning on the idea that it is impossible for properties to exist without something they are the property of. This argument reveals that Aristotle thinks distance is a property of matter. According to Aristotle, it is impossible to measure distance in a pure void. Therefore, Aristotle reasons, it is not possible for a void to exist because it would occupy a distance that has no measure.</p>
            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-478">Thought experiments are also common in ethics as a way of testing out moral theories. A moral theory could be supported by a thought experiment if the result of applying the moral theory to a hypothetical case made good moral sense. On the other hand, the thought experiment might undermine the moral theory by demonstrating that when the theory is applied, it results in an absurd or immoral outcome. </p>

Conceptual analysis, logic, and sources of evidence together help philosophers compose a picture of the world that helps them get a better grasp of truth. Recall that philosophers are attempting to understand how things hang together&#x2014;in the broadest sense of the term. They are not interested in exploring any specific picture of the world; they want the broadest, most complete picture. Thus, they need to use a variety of tools to provide an accurate picture that makes some rational sense and is likely to be true.
</p>
          <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-692">However, it is unlikely that any single philosophical picture of the world will turn out to be so obviously compelling that it completely satisfies all criteria of logic, evidence, and conceptual analysis. It is much more likely that there will be competing pictures, each with strong reasons for believing in it. This is what we tend to find in philosophical discussions. No one picture is so obviously true that all others can be immediately discarded. Instead, we have to evaluate each picture of the world and understand the trade-offs that these pictures impose on us. We have to consider the practical and logical implications of the beliefs we hold to fully understand whether those beliefs are true and right.</p>

She is best known for her work on totalitarianism, power, and the notion of evil. She coined the phrase &#x201C;the banality of evil&#x201D; when reporting for the New Yorker magazine on the Nuremberg trial of Nazi bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann. The Nuremberg trials were a series of trails held in Nuremberg, Germany, after World War II in which Nazi leaders were held accountable for their war crimes before the international community. Subsequently, Arendt wrote the article, &#x201C;Thinking and Moral Considerations,&#x201D; in which she describes the ways that Eichmann&#x2019;s inability or unwillingness to consider the real, moral consequences of his actions caused him to behave in radically immoral ways. Arendt diagnoses the core problem of a person like Eichmann as &#x201C;not stupidity but a curious, quite authentic inability to think.&#x201D; She considers thought to involve aesthetic and moral judgments such that for a person to engage in evil action requires them to disregard self-reflection and conscientious thought.

            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-717">
Sometimes when weighing the trade-offs of a particular view and its logical consequences, you may decide to &#x201C;bite the bullet.&#x201D; This means that you are willing to accept the negative consequences of the view because you find the view attractive for other reasons. For instance, on the topic of free will, a philosopher might be committed to the idea that past physical causes fully determine the future. In such a case, the philosopher is willing to accept the negative implications of the conclusion that free will is an illusion. In ethics, some philosophers are committed to the view that morality is entirely determined by the total quantity of effects caused by an action. Such philosophers may be willing to accept things that would otherwise seem immoral, like harming an individual person if that action results in a greater quantity of positive effects in the end. No view is going to be perfect, and it is difficult to make sense of the world in terms that we can explain and understand. Nonetheless, we must be honest about the logical and moral consequences of the views we hold. If you are ultimately willing to accept those consequences to maintain the view, then you can bite the bullet.

            <h4 data-type="title">Reflective Equilibrium</h4>
            <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_eip-6">
Another method for assessing the logical and moral consequences of our thinking is to use judgments about particular cases to revise principles, rules, or theories about general cases. This process of going back and forth between an assessment of the coherence of the theory and judgments about practical, applied cases is called <span data-type="term" group-by="r" id="auto_page_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_term16">reflective equilibrium</span>. This process requires the revision of a theoretical and principled stance based on practical judgments about particular cases. Reflective equilibrium is achieved when you are able to establish some coherence between your theoretical and practical beliefs. Reflective equilibrium is a kind of coherence method: that is, reflective equilibrium justifies beliefs by assessing their logical consistency. As opposed to a traditional coherence approach, however, reflective equilibrium encourages the use of practical and applied judgments about cases as part of the set of beliefs that is logically consistent. By engaging in reflective equilibrium, the philosopher considers both theoretical and practical considerations for a view. Reflective equilibrium is an important method for introductory students to understand because students are frequently tempted to think they need to solve theoretical issues first before they can consider applications. Or they may choose a theory and then apply it to cases. Reflective equilibrium emphasizes that this procedure is likely neither possible nor desirable. Instead, a philosopher should be aware of both the theoretical commitments and the practical concerns of their position and use their understanding of each to inform the final analysis of their beliefs.

Even though he did not write any works himself, his life and thought are captured by three different, contemporary sources whose works we still have. Socrates is depicted in several of Aristophanes&#x2019;s comedic plays. Aristophanes, one of the most accomplished comedic playwrights in ancient Athens, won several dramatic competitions of his day.  Eleven of his forty plays survive, and in three of them&#x2014;<em data-effect="italics">The Clouds, The Frogs, and The Birds</em>&#x2014;Socrates appears as a main character. <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="A" id="auto_page_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_term18">Aristophanes</span>&#x2019;s depiction of Socrates is ridiculous, and Plato appears to think that this depiction is partially responsible for Socrates&#x2019;s ultimate trial and death. Another contemporary of Socrates, the historian Xenophon, wrote an account of Socrates&#x2019;s trial and death in his <em data-effect="italics">Memorabilia</em>. Finally, and most important, Socrates&#x2019;s student and friend Plato made Socrates the central figure in most of his dialogues. Plato along with Aristotle are the most influential of the Athenian philosophers and have had a profound influence on the development of Western philosophy. Nearly all of Plato&#x2019;s work is preserved to this day. Plato wrote exclusively in the form of dialogues, where his characters engage in discussion centered on philosophical issues. Most of what we know about Socrates is derived from Plato&#x2019;s depiction of him as the primary questioner in the dialogues. Therefore, even though Socrates did not write works of his own, his life&#x2014;and death&#x2014;remain a testament to his profound and impactful philosophical life. For that reason, it is useful for us to consider the figure of Socrates as a paradigm of the philosophical life.</p>

        <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-469">In particular, Socrates&#x2019;s defense of himself during his trial is in many ways a defense of the philosophical life. Socrates was accused by a young, upstart politician named Meletus of corrupting the youth and undermining the gods of the city. These crimes were considered to be a kind of treason that undermined the legitimacy and future of Athenian democracy. Even though Socrates was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death, the speech he gave to the Athenians, as recorded by Plato, remains a vivid and compelling defense of the sort of life he lived. In the end, his defense was not successful. He was convicted, imprisoned, and killed in 399 BCE. Plato provides accounts of the trial and death, not only in the <em data-effect="italics">Apology</em>, but also in the <em data-effect="italics">Crito</em>, where Socrates argues with his friend Crito that it would be unjust for him to escape from prison, and in the <em data-effect="italics">Phaedo</em>, where Socrates engages in a debate with several close friends, arguing in his jail cell just before he dies that the soul is immortal.</p>

            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-776">I dare say, Athenians, that someone among you will reply, &#x201C;Why is this, Socrates, and what is the origin of these accusations of you: for there must have been something strange which you have been doing? All this great fame and talk about you would never have arisen if you had been like other men: tell us, then, why this is, as we should be sorry to judge hastily of you.&#x201D; Now I regard this as a fair challenge, and I will endeavor to explain to you the origin of this name of &#x201C;wise,&#x201D; and of this evil fame. Please attend to them. And although some of you may think I am joking, I declare that I will tell you the entire truth. Men of Athens, this reputation of mine has come of a certain sort of wisdom which I possess. If you ask me what kind of wisdom, I reply, such wisdom as is attainable by man, for to that extent I am inclined to believe that I am wise; whereas the persons of whom I was speaking have a superhuman wisdom, which I may fail to describe, because I have it not myself; and he who says that I have, speaks falsely, and is taking away my character. And here, O men of Athens, I must beg you not to interrupt me, even if I seem to say something extravagant. For the word which I will speak is not mine. I will refer you to a witness who is worthy of credit, and will tell you about my wisdom&#x2014;whether I have any, and of what sort&#x2014;and that witness shall be the god of Delphi. You must have known Chaerephon; he was early a friend of mine, and also a friend of yours, for he shared in the exile of the people, and returned with you. Well, Chaerephon, as you know, was very impetuous in all his doings, and he went to Delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether&#x2014;as I was saying, I must beg you not to interrupt&#x2014;he asked the oracle to tell him whether there was anyone wiser than I was, and the Pythian prophetess answered that there was no man wiser. Chaerephon is dead himself, but his brother, who is in court, will confirm the truth of this story.</p>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-405">Why do I mention this? Because I am going to explain to you why I have such an evil name. When I heard the answer, I said to myself, &#x201C;What can the god mean? and what is the interpretation of this riddle? for I know that I have no wisdom, small or great. What can he mean when he says that I am the wisest of men? And yet he is a god and cannot lie; that would be against his nature.&#x201D; After a long consideration, I at last thought of a method of trying the question. I reflected that if I could only find a man wiser than myself, then I might go to the god with a refutation in my hand. I should say to him, &#x201C;Here is a man who is wiser than I am; but you said that I was the wisest.&#x201D; Accordingly I went to one who had the reputation of wisdom, and observed to him&#x2014;his name I need not mention; he was a politician whom I selected for examination&#x2014;and the result was as follows: When I began to talk with him, I could not help thinking that he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and wiser still by himself; and I went and tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise, but was not really wise; and the consequence was that he hated me, and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me. So I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: &#x201C;Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is&#x2014;for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows. I neither know nor think that I know. In this latter particular, then, I seem to have slightly the advantage of him.&#x201D; Then I went to another, who had still higher philosophical pretensions, and my conclusion was exactly the same. I made another enemy of him, and of many others besides him.</p>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-357">After this I went to one man after another, being not unconscious of the enmity which I provoked, and I lamented and feared this: but necessity was laid upon me&#x2014;the word of God, I thought, ought to be considered first. And I said to myself, &#x201C;Go I must to all who appear to know, and find out the meaning of the oracle.&#x201D; And I swear to you, Athenians, by the dog I swear!&#x2014;for I must tell you the truth&#x2014;the result of my mission was just this: I found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that some inferior men were really wiser and better. I will tell you the tale of my wanderings and of the &#x201C;Herculean&#x201D; labors, as I may call them, which I endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable. When I left the politicians, I went to the poets; tragic, dithyrambic, and all sorts. And there, I said to myself, you will be detected; now you will find out that you are more ignorant than they are. Accordingly, I took them some of the most elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked what was the meaning of them&#x2014;thinking that they would teach me something. Will you believe me? I am almost ashamed to speak of this, but still I must say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they did themselves. That showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them. And the poets appeared to me to be much in the same case; and I further observed that upon the strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things in which they were not wise. So I departed, conceiving myself to be superior to them for the same reason that I was superior to the politicians.</p>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-928">At last I went to the artisans, for I was conscious that I knew nothing at all, as I may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things; and in this I was not mistaken, for they did know many things of which I was ignorant, and in this they certainly were wiser than I was. But I observed that even the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets; because they were good workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of high matters, and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom&#x2014;therefore I asked myself on behalf of the oracle, whether I would like to be as I was, neither having their knowledge nor their ignorance, or like them in both; and I made answer to myself and the oracle that I was better off as I was.</p>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-461">This investigation has led to my having many enemies of the worst and most dangerous kind, and has given occasion also to many calumnies, and I am called wise, for my hearers always imagine that I myself possess the wisdom which I find wanting in others: but the truth is, O men of Athens, that God only is wise; and in this oracle he means to say that the wisdom of men is little or nothing; he is not speaking of Socrates, he is only using my name as an illustration, as if he said, &#x201C;He, O men, is the wisest, who, like Socrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing.&#x201D; And so I go my way, obedient to the god, and make inquisition into the wisdom of anyone, whether citizen or stranger, who appears to be wise; and if he is not wise, then in vindication of the oracle I show him that he is not wise; and this occupation quite absorbs me, and I have no time to give either to any public matter of interest or to any concern of my own, but I am in utter poverty by reason of my devotion to the god.</p>

          <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-402">
After Socrates is convicted and has a chance to address the jury to persuade them to offer him a sentence or punishment other than death, he considers and then rejects the idea of exile. If he lived in exile, Socrates believed he would no longer be able to carry on his work as a philosopher because a foreign city would be even less welcoming of his strange questioning than his hometown. In speaking about this alternative he claims:

For if I tell you that this would be a disobedience to a divine command, and therefore that I cannot hold my tongue, you will not believe that I am serious; and if I say again that the greatest good of man is daily to converse about virtue, and all that concerning which you hear me examining myself and others, and that the life which is unexamined is not worth living&#x2014;that you are still less likely to believe.</p>

The statement ought to make us pause and reflect, not only because Socrates himself demonstrates his commitment to a particular kind of life, to the point of accepting death, but also because the charge that an unexamined life is not worth living rightly seems like such a serious thing. To have lived a life that is not worth living: what could be worse? Given the stakes, we ought to wonder, what does Socrates mean by an unexamined life? Or, alternatively, what would it look like to examine one&#x2019;s life in the appropriate way?</p>

In the <em data-effect="italics">Apology</em>, Socrates&#x2019;s friend asks the oracle at Delphi to tell him who is the wisest man in Athens. In other Platonic dialogues, Socrates reminds us that one of the three maxims engraved at the place of the oracle is the phrase, &#x201C;know thyself.&#x201D; Like most oracular statements, it is not immediately clear what is meant by this phrase. Plato suggests it may be a kind of warning to those who enter the oracle: &#x201C;know your position relative to the gods!&#x201D; Alternatively, it may be a command to understand your own nature and your own mind before you seek to understand other people or the things of the world. Based on our reading of Socrates&#x2019;s life and works, we can assume that he considers this saying to be a command to investigate our beliefs and knowledge, to appreciate the limits of our own knowledge, and to strive to eliminate inconsistencies. After all, Socrates&#x2019;s method of questioning as it is told to us in Plato&#x2019;s dialogues (and as Socrates himself describes in the excerpted passage) is exactly such an inquiry. Socrates questions others about whether their beliefs are consistent and whether they have adequate justification for the beliefs they hold. This line of questioning suggests that Socrates holds such consistency and internal justification in high regard. We can imagine that Socrates considers an unexamined life to be one in which a person hold beliefs without justification or hold beliefs that are inconsistent with one another. We may then speculate that an unexamined is not worth living because it is dictated by beliefs and ideas that have never been tested, justified, nor accounted for. You might respond that endless questioning is boring or difficult, or you might respond that &#x201C;ignorance is bliss.&#x201D; For a philosopher, this attitude is not only undesirable, but it also approaches irrationality. It seems that, for whatever makes life worth living for creatures capable of rational thought, a minimum requirement is that we believe things worth believing in, hold positions we can defend, and understand why we do what we do. To do that, we need to engage in self-examination.

            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-668">
Even though Socrates himself did not develop an account of nature and the cosmos like many of the Presocratic philosophers, we may imagine that living an examined life requires us to understand the world around us. Socrates himself was well aware of the various natural philosophical accounts that were prominent in his day. Plato frequently records Socrates quoting or citing another philosopher&#x2019;s account of the planets and stars, natural change, or other natural phenomenon when he is questioning others. Indeed, several of the dialogues place Socrates in conversations about the nature of the soul, the nature of causality, the classification of animals and plants, and so forth, all of which could fall under the examination of nature. Why might such a process of examination be important for a life worth living? Without a clear answer from Socrates or Plato, we might, again, speculate that it is important for us remain curious. The capacity to reason gives human beings the ability to investigate how things work, to discover truths about the world around them. Neglecting that drive to understand the world around us is like neglecting a natural skill. In any case, methods of philosophical reflection are useful for making sense of the world around us. Such investigation is characteristic of the ancient philosophers and may be considered part of a life worth living.

          <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-559">
In the excerpt from Plato&#x2019;s <em data-effect="italics">Apology</em>, Socrates investigates the oracle&#x2019;s strange response that he is the wisest of men. First, Socrates attempts to prove the oracle wrong by finding someone wiser than he. But, after a time, he comes to realize that the oracle&#x2019;s response was a kind of riddle. He interprets the oracle as saying that Socrates is wisest because he alone realizes that human wisdom is worth little or nothing. This realization is important for Socrates&#x2019;s own self-examination and provides an important lesson for philosophy students.

            <h4 data-type="title">Understanding the Limits of Knowledge</h4>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-365">
Perhaps one of the greatest lessons you can learn from a well-rounded college education is just how much more there is to know about the world. Even the most respected scientists, philosophers, mathematicians, and historians recognize that the scope of their expertise is extremely limited. A lifetime of study can, at best, give a person deep insights into a tiny fraction of the universe of human knowledge. Beyond that, there is a vast domain of things that no human has yet discovered or understood. In reality, our understanding of the world is quite limited. It is a good idea to practice Socrates&#x2019;s advice: to be aware of what you do not know and not to assert knowledge where you lack it. People are often resistant to taking this position because they want answers. Indeed, someone who is able to convince others that they know the solution to a particular problem or a personal dilemma can exert a great deal of power over others. But we ought to recognize the dangers of asserting knowledge where we lack it. In technical areas, a refusal to admit ignorance can result in the failure of equipment, the malfunctioning of machines, and, in the worst cases, injury and loss of life. In the moral and political arenas, asserting knowledge where you lack it may lead to unnecessary disagreements and polarization, or it may result in ill-considered actions that result in ethical mistakes and harm to others. Most importantly, if you are not aware when you lack knowledge, you won&#x2019;t acquire the knowledge you lack. If you believe you already know something, you won&#x2019;t listen to the evidence that disproves what you believe. As a result, you will miss out on learning the truth.

            <h4 data-type="title">The Socratic Method</h4>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-647">
Socrates engaged in a particular method of questioning, sometimes known as the &#x201C;Socratic method,&#x201D; which was characterized by his asking questions of others rather than explaining his own beliefs. Socrates typically appears to be hesitant to offer his own ideas about the topic under discussion. Instead, he asks the people he is questioning to supply the subject-matter for their discussion. Socrates&#x2019;s use of this strategy may initially seem unclear. One explanation may be that he is following the god&#x2019;s command, as he says in the <em data-effect="italics">Apology</em>. Another explanation is that he does not claim to have knowledge about the topic in question and is genuinely happy to learn from others. Yet another possibility is that Socrates feigns ignorance and is being insincere. Perhaps his true goal is to trap or humiliate the other person by discovering some inconsistency or obvious falsehood in what they believe. It is hard to know which of these is the most likely explanation, but let&#x2019;s focus for a moment on a fourth possibility, namely, a pedagogical one.
</p>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-406">In two different Platonic dialogues, Socrates explains what he is doing by using an analogy: he compares his method of questioning to the role taken by a midwife during childbirth. In fact, Plato tells us that Socrates&#x2019;s mother was a midwife and that he assumes her role in philosophical conversation. The goal of Socratic questioning, then, is to assist the person being questioned in discovering the truth on their own. By asking questions and examining the claims made by another person, Socrates allows that person to go through a process of self-discovery. This method provides an interesting lesson for teaching and learning. Often, students believe that their role is to simply receive knowledge from the teacher. But Socrates reminds us that real learning comes only through self-discovery and that the role of the teacher is to be an assistant, providing the kind of critical examination and evaluation necessary to help the student discover truth on their own.</p>

          <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-529">
 Even though many of the sages discussed in the first section of this chapter are concerned with understanding nature, Socrates is much more concerned with ethics, or how to live a good life. He considers the primary purpose of philosophy to make one&#x2019;s life better by making the philosopher a better person. Even though Socrates rarely claims to have knowledge about anything at all, some of the few instances where he does profess knowledge relate directly to morality. In particular, Socrates asserts a pair of moral principles that are quite controversial and may appear at first glance false. However, upon closer inspection, you may find that these principles bear some truth that is worth reflection.

            <h4 data-type="title">Socrates&#x2019;s Harm Principle</h4>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-667">Socrates claims the following:</p>
            <ol id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-108" type="1">
              <li> No one willingly chooses what is harmful to themselves.</li>
              <li>When a person does harm to others, they actually harm themselves.</li>
            </ol>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-723">The first principle is sometimes stated as &#x201C;no one intentionally chooses evil,&#x201D; but for the purposes of this discussion, it will be clearer to consider the above formulation. The important thing to understand about the first principle is that Socrates believes that when people choose bad things, they do so out of ignorance. The reason he thinks so is that he believes all people desire what is good. For Socrates, it is intuitively true that whatever someone desires, that desire is always directed at something that appears good to them, which means a person can&#x2019;t choose what is harmful for its own sake. Instead, Socrates reasons, when individuals do harmful things, they believe that what they are doing will bring about some good for them. In other words, when people choose evil, they do so in the belief that it is good or will bring about something good. If, in fact, they are wrong, then that was the fault of ignorance, not a desire to do evil. If they had better understood the consequences of their actions, Socrates reasons, they would not have chosen something harmful.</p>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-359">The second principle derives from the fact that Socrates thinks the greatest harm that can come to anyone is for their soul&#x2014;or their character&#x2014;to become corrupted. Since a corrupted soul is the result of making the kinds of choices that produce harm, it follows that whenever someone does something harmful, they corrupt their soul, so they harm themselves. At the end of the <em data-effect="italics">Apology</em>, Socrates argues that it is not possible to harm a good man because, even though you might kill him, you cannot harm his character or make him do evil. Socrates seems to regard physical suffering, and even death, as a temporary and minor harm. Moreover, he regards the harm to one&#x2019;s character by living a life of ignorance or malevolence as far worse than physical death.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">Comparison of Socrates&#x2019;s Harm Principle with <em data-effect="italics">Ahimsa</em> in the Indian Tradition</h4>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-546">
It may be instructive to consider the possible connection between the core concept of <span data-type="term" group-by="a" id="auto_page_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_term19">ahimsa</span> in classical Indian philosophy and Socrates&#x2019;s harm principle as discussed above. Etymologically, the word ahimsa, in Sanskrit, literally means &#x201C;the absence of doing injury or harm.&#x201D; The concept is found throughout Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist texts and likely has its origins deep in classical Indian thought. A well-known illustration of ahimsa comes from Jainism where the concept is taken to what most of us would consider to be extreme measures&#x2014;at least in the case of Jain ascetics observing ahimsa as one of the &#x201C;great vows.&#x201D; Such ascetic Jains must take the greatest possible care not to cause harm, intentionally or unintentionally, to any creature, including insects, plants, and microbes. At the end of their lives, a devout Jain may even fast to death (stop eating) in one final renunciation of doing harm. Another well-known example of ahimsa can be seen the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi, who used the concept to establish a nonviolent civil disobedience movement which some say helped speed the colonial British departure from India. 
</p>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-223">Ahimsa is identified as one of the highest virtues in the Vedic tradition (the Vedas are the most sacred scriptures of India) and is one of the loftiest teachings in Indian philosophy. The idea of ahimsa informs animal ethics, just-war theory, and interpersonal relations. On a metaphysical level, ahimsa is connected with karma&#x2014;the causal law that links causes to effects, even across lifetimes. Religious Indians believe that an individual will bear a future burden for harms committed in the present through the process of samsara&#x2014;or transmigration and rebirth of the soul. According to this religious and philosophical theory, the soul brings both its good and bad karma (fruit of action) with it from life to life and will either enjoy the fruits of prior good actions or suffer the consequences of bad ones. Because of the laws of karma and reincarnation, any action resulting in violence, injury, or harm has the direct consequence of chaining an individual&#x2019;s soul to a process of rebirth and material suffering. Insofar as a person causes injury and suffering to others, they increase the total negative effects in nature. While all attachment to the fruit of action binds the soul to the cycle of rebirth, bad actions in particular prevent the soul from doing what is necessary to reach liberation&#x2014;or freedom from birth and death. In summary, the individual creates bad effects for themselves by acting badly. From the perspective of Indian philosophy, there is a natural connection among all beings, so causing harm or injury to one entity is like harming a family member or even a part of oneself. Additionally, because individual experience is governed by the laws of karma, harm and injury to others has the result of causing injury to oneself.</p>
            <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_eip-225">However, ahimsa does not focus only on the problem of causing harm. The practice of ahimsa also calls for the practice of love and compassion toward all beings. Following the same principles of karma and samsara, acts of love, kindness, and generosity have the effect of increasing the total amount of good in the world, of recognizing that we are, in the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., &#x201C;caught in an inescapable network of mutuality,&#x201D; and &#x201C;tied in a single garment of destiny.&#x201D; The practice of love and compassion increases the possibility of liberation from material suffering.</p>

Philosophers today, like other academics, focus on specific areas of research expertise with the goal of producing new research that advances our philosophical understanding of specific problems or topic areas. That said, philosophical investigation is still motivated by the same desire to make sense of things in the most universal way possible. To give you a taste of contemporary academic philosophy, this section will outline the major areas of specialization in philosophy and discuss different approaches academic philosophers take to their areas of study.</p>

It is common for academic philosophers to focus on a specific area of research with the goal of becoming an expert in that field. Expertise is generally marked by the production of a research work, such as a dissertation, book, or several research articles on the topic. These research areas are called &#x201C;areas of specialization.&#x201D; Areas of specialization typically have a number of sub-topics that include specific problems of study in that area. This textbook is organized in a way that generally reflects the broad areas of specialization in contemporary academic philosophy. Following the primary job board in academic philosophy, PhilJobs (https://philjobs.org/), areas of specialization can be grouped, broadly, into the following fields: historical traditions; metaphysics and epistemology; science, logic, and mathematics; and value theory. The fields of science, logic, and mathematics include research into contemporary symbolic logic as well as interdisciplinary work in the philosophy of mathematics and the sciences. It may include things like philosophy of biology, philosophy of cognitive science, or philosophy of computing. The philosophy of mathematics and the sciences is closely related to metaphysics and epistemology. This textbook covers

          <p id="auto_36fcc3ba-b6c3-4b33-bc0e-6760f13564b4_eip-586">
We have already seen the variety of methods philosophers use to arrive at truth. Academic philosophers use these techniques to do research in the areas described above. More traditional areas of philosophy, such as metaphysics, epistemology, and logic, rely heavily on conceptual analysis, logic, intuition, and common sense. These areas of study tend to be highly analytical and abstract. They may incorporate some evidence from other disciplines or common experience, but that input is likely to be abstracted and general. Some of the applied topics of metaphysics and epistemology, by contrast, are more interdisciplinary in nature. Therefore, studies in the philosophy of the various sciences will necessarily engage with the results and practices in those specific sciences. 
</p>
          <p id="auto_36fcc3ba-b6c3-4b33-bc0e-6760f13564b4_eip-idm245747232">When it comes to value theory, philosophers use a broad range of methods. Some philosophers will be highly interdisciplinary and practical in their approach. Others will be more abstract and analytical. Still others might be informed by their critical engagement with history. Finally, philosophers who study historical traditions incorporate the techniques of history to understand the context and original meaning of historical philosophy. These philosophers must be well-versed in the language that the original philosophy was written in and understand the cultural and historical climate that influenced the writing. But they also will use the analytic and conceptual techniques of contemporary philosophy to try to make the best sense of what these historical thinkers were trying to say. </p>
          <p id="auto_36fcc3ba-b6c3-4b33-bc0e-6760f13564b4_eip-idm225428704">
	As the field of philosophy has become more professionalized and academic in its approach, individual philosophers have become more focused on specific topic areas and more specialized in their methods and techniques. This trend can result in a lack awareness among contemporary philosophers with respect to what their colleagues. Moreover, today&#x2019;s philosophers may find themselves unable to engage with the work of their colleagues. The trade-off of academic research is that as we become more specialized and productive in very specific topics of study, as we become less able to be generalists who can gain a sense of the way the whole of philosophy hangs together.</p>
          <p id="auto_36fcc3ba-b6c3-4b33-bc0e-6760f13564b4_eip-idm229068848">
This textbook has made a special effort to highlight the variety of approaches to academic philosophy, focusing on interdisciplinary, practical, and divergent traditions. Additionally, we have emphasized the multicultural and global traditions of philosophy. This approach is not common for Introduction to Philosophy textbooks. Many textbooks are dominated by the history of philosophy in Europe and the philosophical methods most popular in the Anglophone world. We believe that by highlighting a broader range of content, we offer students a more holistic perspective on the practice of philosophy. By surveying a full range of topics, methods, and sources, we believe that this textbook can provide more complete overview of the discipline of philosophy.</p>
          <p id="auto_36fcc3ba-b6c3-4b33-bc0e-6760f13564b4_eip-idm238638176">
Whether you go on to study philosophy as a philosophy major (and even go on to graduate studies) or if this is the only philosophy course you take, the habits of mind and techniques of philosophical thought that you learn can have a transformative effect. When you allow yourself to reflect on how a certain situation connects to the whole, when you critically examine your own biases and beliefs, when you investigate the world with an open mind, informed by rational methods of investigation, you will arrive at a richer sense of who you are and what is your place in the world.

          <p id="auto_960c707c-79a8-44d0-bd5c-2fef4afdc553_fs-idm226193856">Philosophy is an activity in which philosophers attempt to gain the broadest and most fundamental conception of the world as they experience it. Defining philosophy is difficult, since philosophers do not start with specific subject matter, but rather with an open-minded attitude toward whatever they observe while avoiding preconceptions in their attempts to understand what they see. The origins of philosophy are ancient, and the earliest philosophers were called sages&#x2014;wise men who sought to answer questions about how the natural world worked as well as psychological and moral questions, such as &#x201C;What constitutes a good life?&#x201D;  Early philosophers were known their wisdom in a variety of areas, including technical crafts, science, logic, mathematics, politics, and morality. Wilfrid Sellars, a highly influential twentieth-century philosopher, is known for his concise and telling explanation of what philosophers do, which is to figure out how everything&#x2014;in the broadest sense&#x2014;&#x201C;hangs together.&#x201D;</p>

          <p id="auto_691b2d1d-a37c-48df-81b1-eaadfb84d2d5_fs-idm39664">Philosophers use a number of techniques to gain a holistic understanding of how things hang together in the broadest possible sense. While philosophy is not science, it still requires sources of evidence to justify its claims. Some of these sources include the history of philosophy; intuition, or realizations that are a product of a clear and attentive mind; and common sense, or facts that are ascertained through sense perception. More recently, philosophy uses scientific methods of inquiry or draws on the insights and discoveries of other disciplines. Logic has always been an important part of both philosophical and scientific reasoning, and argument is used by philosophers to organize their premises and conclusions. Conceptual analysis is another important tool in the philosopher&#x2019;s took kit: this type of analysis breaks down complex ideas into smaller and simpler components to better understand the whole. The field of logic has been further advanced by replacing natural language with symbolic language (similar to mathematics) for the purpose of understanding the relationship between names of objects and concepts. Additional techniques used by philosophers are thought experiments, trade-offs (sacrificing one conception of the world in favor of another), &#x201C;biting the bullet&#x201D; (accepting the negative implications of a view that has much to recommend it), and reflective equilibrium (comparing theory to real-world cases or examples). </p>

          <p id="auto_336abf21-4c86-458f-a6dc-24fc8d9fcada_fs-idm365251408">Socrates, and ancient Greek philosopher, can be viewed as a kind of paradigm of what it means to do philosophy. Socrates&#x2019;s philosophy is known to us primarily through the writings of his student Plato. Socrates famously cautioned that &#x201C;the unexamined life is not worth living.&#x201D; With  his characteristic humility, Socrates insists that &#x201C;human wisdom is worth little or nothing.&#x201D; He used a careful and stringent method of questioning to help students understand what they were thinking, and he stoically went to his death after he was condemned by the state, since he would rather die than be exiled and unable to carry on the philosophic enterprise. Socrates made few philosophical claims, but he did assert two moral principles: that no one willingly chooses what is harmful and when a person does harm to others, they harm themselves. Socrates&#x2019;s principle to do no harm is similar to the Indian concept of ahimsa or nonharming, which is a central moral value in Indian religious and philosophical systems.</p>

          <p id="auto_36fcc3ba-b6c3-4b33-bc0e-6760f13564b4_fs-idm357881424">Contemporary academic philosophy is very different from the classical traditions, although the motivation for doing philosophy remains the same. Nowadays, philosophers are encouraged to specialize in one sub-area of philosophy. The major areas include historical traditions; metaphysics and epistemology; science, logic, and mathematics; and value theory. The fields of science, logic, and mathematics include research into contemporary symbolic logic and interdisciplinary work in the philosophy of mathematics and the sciences. This subfield also includes such areas as the philosophy of biology, philosophy of cognitive science, or philosophy of computing. This Introduction to Philosophy text takes a broad multicultural and multi-perspectival approach to philosophy. Moreover, its overarching purpose is to teach the student beginning in philosophy the philosophical habit of mind, which can have a transformative effect on thinking.  </p>
