<p id="auto_eb1e3bc3-d0fd-4119-b0ed-f7a206e545b2_fs-idm206037568"><em data-effect="italics">Business Ethics</em> is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of the single-semester standardized business ethics course across all majors. This title includes innovative features designed to enhance student learning, including case studies, application scenarios, and links to video interviews with executives, all of which help instill in students a sense of ethical awareness and responsibility. The book provides an important opportunity for students to learn the core concepts of business ethics and understand how to apply those concepts to their professional lives.</p>

<p id="auto_eb1e3bc3-d0fd-4119-b0ed-f7a206e545b2_fs-idm184076816">Our <em data-effect="italics">Business Ethics</em> textbook adheres to the scope and sequence requirements of introductory business ethics courses nationwide. We have endeavored to make the core theories and practical concepts of business ethics engaging, relevant, and accessible to students. The guiding themes of the textbook are to promote high ethical standards and to assist the integration of ethical thinking across the business school curriculum, with an end result of encouraging even greater ethical consciousness on the part of business practitioners beyond their graduation. We particularly emphasize the reality of today’s global business community and observe that geography, culture, and time contribute to ethical concepts and constructs. With awareness of these issues in mind, the content of this textbook has been developed and arranged to emphasize the necessity—and difficulty—of ethical decision-making. The authors seek to help students recognize legal and moral issues, reason through the consequences of different courses of action, and promote social responsibility. The text emphasizes connections between topics such as ethical theories, legal responsibilities, the prioritization of stakeholders, and corporate social responsibility. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from business ethics instructors dedicated to the project.</p>

<p id="auto_282cabf7-18a2-4e8c-b46d-3cdd8e6bc5c8_fs-idm401816592">Ethics consists of the standards of behavior to which we hold ourselves in our personal and professional lives. It establishes the levels of honesty, empathy, and trustworthiness and other virtues by which we hope to identify our personal behavior and our public reputation. In our personal lives, our ethics sets norms for the ways in which we interact with family and friends. In our professional lives, ethics guides our interactions with customers, clients, colleagues, employees, and shareholders affected by our business practices (<a href="#auto_282cabf7-18a2-4e8c-b46d-3cdd8e6bc5c8_OSX_Ethics_01_00_Decisions" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_282cabf7-18a2-4e8c-b46d-3cdd8e6bc5c8_fs-idm407212944">Should we care about ethics in our lives? In our practices in business and the professions? That is the central question we will examine in this chapter and throughout the book. Our goal is to understand why the answer is <em data-effect="italics">yes</em>.</p>

<p id="auto_282cabf7-18a2-4e8c-b46d-3cdd8e6bc5c8_fs-idm404973376">Whatever hopes you have for your future, you almost certainly want to be successful in whatever career you choose. But what does success mean to you, and how will you know you have achieved it? Will you measure it in terms of wealth, status, power, or recognition? Before blindly embarking on a quest to achieve these goals, which society considers important, stop and think about what a successful career means to you personally. Does it include a blameless reputation, colleagues whose good opinion you value, and the ability to think well of yourself? How might ethics guide your decision-making and contribute to your achievement of these goals?</p>

You may decide you should always tell the truth to family, friends, customers, clients, and shareholders, and if that is not possible, you should have very good reasons why you cannot. You may also choose never to defraud or mislead your business partners. You may decide, as well, that while you are pursuing profit in your business, you will not require that all the money on the table come your way. Instead, there might be some to go around to those who are important because they are affected one way or another by your business. These are your stakeholders.</p>

<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm405004432">Clients, customers, suppliers, investors, retailers, employees, the media, the government, members of the surrounding community, competitors, and even the environment are <span data-type="term">stakeholders</span> in a business; that is, they are individuals and entities affected by the business’s decisions (<a href="#auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_OSX_Ethics_01_01_Stakeholders" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Stakeholders typically value a leadership team that chooses the ethical way to accomplish the company’s legitimate for-profit goals. For example, Patagonia expresses its commitment to environmentalism via its “1% for the Planet” program, which donates 1 percent of all sales to help save the planet. In part because of this program, Patagonia has become a market leader in outdoor gear.</p>

<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm402235088">Being successful at work may therefore consist of much more than simply earning money and promotions. It may also mean treating our employees, customers, and clients with honesty and respect. It may come from the sense of pride we feel about engaging in honest transactions, not just because the law demands it but because we demand it of ourselves. It may lie in knowing the profit we make does not come from shortchanging others. Thus, <span data-type="term">business ethics</span> guides the conduct by which companies and their agents abide by the law and respect the rights of their stakeholders, particularly their customers, clients, employees, and the surrounding community and environment. Ethical business conduct permits us to sleep well at night.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm400154912" class="link-to-learning">
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm408144096">Are business ethics an oxymoron? <a href="https://openstax.org/l/53oxymoron">Read “Why Ethics Matter” to understand</a> just a few of the reasons to have values-driven management.</p>
</div>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm400415824">Nearly all systems of religious belief stress the building blocks of engaging others with respect, empathy, and honesty. These foundational beliefs, in turn, prepare us for the codes of ethical behavior that serve as ideal guides for business and the professions. Still, we need not subscribe to any religious faith to hold that ethical behavior in business is still necessary. Just by virtue of being human, we all share obligations to one another, and principal among these is the requirement that we treat others with fairness and dignity, including in our commercial transactions.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm409734016">For this reason, we use the words <em data-effect="italics">ethics</em> and <em data-effect="italics">morals</em> interchangeably in this book, though some philosophers distinguish between them. We hold that “an ethical person” conveys the same sense as “a moral person,” and we do not regard religious belief as a requirement for acting ethically in business and the professions. Because we are all humans and in the same world, we should extend the same behavior to all. It is the right way to behave, but it also burnishes our own professional reputation as business leaders of integrity.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm407243696">Integrity—that is, unity between what we say and what we do—is a highly valued trait. But it is more than just consistency of character. Acting with <span data-type="term">integrity</span> means we adhere strongly to a code of ethics, so it implies trustworthiness and incorruptibility. Being a professional of integrity means consistently striving to be the best person you can be in all your interactions with others. It means you practice what you preach, walk the talk, and do what you believe is right based upon reason. Integrity in business brings many advantages, not the least of which is that it is a critical factor in allowing business and society to function properly.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm397547616">Successful corporate leaders and the companies they represent will take pride in their enterprise if they engage in business with honesty and fair play. To treat customers, clients, employees, and all those affected by a firm with dignity and respect <em data-effect="italics">is</em> ethical. In addition, laudable business practices serve the long-term interests of corporations. Why? Because customers, clients, employees, and society at large will much more willingly patronize a business and work hard on its behalf if that business is perceived as caring about the community it serves. And what type of firm has long-term customers and employees? One whose track record gives evidence of honest business practice.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm397651584" class="link-to-learning">
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm404831856">In <a href="https://openstax.org/l/53MarkFaris">this interview, Mark Faris, a white-collar criminal convicted of fraud, claims that greed, arrogance, and ambition were motivating factors</a> in his actions. He also discusses the human ability to rationalize our behavior to justify it to ourselves. Note his proposed solutions: practicing ethical leadership and developing awareness at an individual level via corporate training.</p>
</div>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm404454544">Many people confuse legal and ethical compliance. They are, however, totally different and call for different standards of behavior. The concepts are not interchangeable in any sense of the word. The law is needed to establish and maintain a functioning society. Without it, our society would be in chaos. Compliance with these legal standards is strictly mandatory: If we violate these standards, we are subject to punishment as established by the law. Therefore, <span data-type="term">compliance</span> in terms of business ethics generally refers to the extent to which a company conducts its business operations in accordance with applicable regulations, statutes, and laws. Yet this represents only a baseline minimum. Ethical observance builds on this baseline and reveals the principles of an individual business leader or a specific organization. Ethical acts are generally considered voluntary and personal—often based on our perception of or stand on right and wrong.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm401275728">Some professions, such as medicine and the law, have traditional codes of ethics. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hippocratic Oath</span>, for example, is embraced by most professionals in health care today as an appropriate standard always owed to patients by physicians, nurses, and others in the field. This obligation traces its lineage to ancient Greece and the physician Hippocrates. Business is different in not having a mutually shared standard of ethics. This is changing, however, as evidenced by the array of codes of conduct and mission statements many companies have adopted over the past century. These have many points in common, and their shared content may eventually produce a code universally claimed by business practitioners. What central point might constitute such a code? Essentially, a commitment to treat with honesty and integrity customers, clients, employees, and others affiliated with a business.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm401372528">The law is typically indebted to tradition and precedence, and compelling reasons are needed to support any change. Ethical reasoning often is more topical and reflects the changes in consciousness that individuals and society undergo. Often, ethical thought precedes and sets the stage for changes in the law.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm397883216">Behaving ethically requires that we meet the mandatory standards of the law, but that is not enough. For example, an action may be legal that we personally consider unacceptable. Companies today need to be focused not only on complying with the letter of the law but also on going above and beyond that basic mandatory requirement to consider their stakeholders and do what is right.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm408534736"><h3 data-type="title">Ends, Means, and Character in Business</h3>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm403332896">How, then, should we behave? Philosophy and science help us answer this question. From philosophy, three different perspectives help us assess whether our decisions are ethical on the basis of reason. These perspectives are called <span data-type="term">normative ethical theories</span> and focus on how people ought to behave; we discuss them in this chapter and in later chapters. In contrast, <em data-effect="italics">descriptive ethical theories</em> are based on scientific evidence, primarily in the field of psychology, and describe how people tend to behave within a particular context; however, they are not the subject of this book.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm411127936">The first normative approach is to examine the ends, or <em data-effect="italics">consequences</em>, a decision produces in order to evaluate whether those ends are ethical. Variations on this approach include utilitarianism, teleology, and consequentialism. For example, <span data-type="term">utilitarianism</span> suggests that an ethical action is one whose consequence achieves the greatest good for the greatest number of people. So if we want to make an ethical decision, we should ask ourselves who is helped and who is harmed by it. Focusing on consequences in this way generally does not require us to take into account the means of achieving that particular end, however. That fact leads us to the second normative theory about what constitutes ethical conduct.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm399052976">The second approach does examine the <em data-effect="italics">means,</em> or actions, we use to carry out a business decision. An example of this approach is <span data-type="term">deontology</span>, which essentially suggests that it is the means that lend nobility to the ends. Deontology contends that each of us owes certain duties to others (<em data-effect="italics">deon</em> is a Greek word for duty or obligation) and that certain universal rules apply to every situation and bind us to these duties. In this view, whether our actions are ethical depends only on whether we adhere to these rules. Thus, the means we use is the primary determinant of ethical conduct. The thinker most closely associated with deontology is the eighteenth-century German philosopher Immanuel <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Kant</span> (<a href="#auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_OSX_Ethics_01_01_Kant" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm399034368">The third normative approach, typically called <span data-type="term">virtue theory</span>, focuses on the <em data-effect="italics">character</em> of the decision-maker—a character that reflects the training we receive growing up. In this view, our ethical analysis of a decision is intimately connected with the person we choose to be. It is through the development of habits, the routine actions in which we choose to engage, that we are able to create a character of integrity and make ethical decisions. Put differently, if a two-year-old is taught to take care of and return borrowed toys even though this runs contrary to every instinct they have, they may continue to perfect their ethical behavior so that at age forty, they can be counted on to safeguard the tens of millions of dollars investors have entrusted to their care in brokerages.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm403877456">Virtue theory has its roots in the Greek philosophical tradition, whose followers sought to learn how to live a flourishing life through study, teaching, and practice. The cardinal virtues to be practiced were courage, self-control, justice, and wisdom. Socrates was often cited as a sage and a role model, whose conduct in life was held in high regard.</p>

In “The Big Idea: The Wise Leader,” a <em data-effect="italics">Harvard Business Review</em> article on leadership and ethical decision-making, Ikujiro Nonaka, a Japanese organizational theorist, and Hirotaka Takeuchi, a professor of Management Practice at Harvard Business School, discuss the gap between the theory and practice of ethics and which characteristics make a wise leader.<a href="#auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_rf-001" data-type="cite" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_rf-001-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_4"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> The authors conclude that “the use of explicit and tacit knowledge isn’t enough; chief executive officers (CEOs) must also draw on a third, often forgotten kind of knowledge, called practical wisdom. Practical wisdom is tacit knowledge acquired from experience that enables people to make prudent judgments and take actions based on the actual situation, guided by values and morals.”</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm403773200">The concept of practical wisdom dates back to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Aristotle</span>, who considered phronesis, which can also be defined as prudence, to be a key intellectual virtue. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Phronesis</span> enables people to make ethically sound judgments. According to the authors, phronetic leaders:</p>
<ul id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm401238096">
<li>practice moral discernment in every situation, making judgments for the common good that are guided by their individual values and ethics;</li>
<li>quickly assess situations and envision the consequences of possible actions or responses;</li>
<li>create a shared sense of purpose among executives and employees and inspire people to work together in pursuit of a common goal;</li>
<li>engage as many people as possible in conversation and communicate using metaphors, stories, and other figurative language in a way that everyone can understand; and</li>
<li>encourage practical wisdom in others and support the training of employees at all levels in its use.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm405003360">In essence, the first question any company should ask itself is: “Do we have a moral purpose?” Having a moral purpose requires focusing on the common good, which precedes the accumulation of profit and results in economic and social benefits. If companies seek the common good, profits generally will follow.</p>

<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm402732080">Ethics sets the standards that govern our personal and professional behavior. To conduct business ethically, we must choose to be a professional of integrity. The first steps are to ask ourselves how we define success and to understand that integrity calls on us to act in a way that is consistent with our words. There is a distinct difference between legal compliance and ethical responsibility, and the law does not fully address all ethical dilemmas that businesses face. Sound ethical practice meets the company’s culture, mission, or policies above and beyond legal responsibilities. The three normative theories of ethical behavior allow us to apply reason to business decisions as we examine the result (utilitarianism), the means of achieving it (deontology), and whether our choice will help us develop a virtuous character (virtue ethics).</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm413590048">Measuring true profitability, however, requires taking a long-term perspective. We cannot accurately measure success within a quarter of a year; a longer time is often required for a product or service to find its market and gain traction against competitors, or for the effects of a new business policy to be felt. Satisfying consumers’ demands, going green, being socially responsible, and acting above and beyond the basic requirements all take time and money. However, the extra cost and effort will result in profits in the long run. If we measure success from this longer perspective, we are more likely to understand the positive effect ethical behavior has on all who are associated with a business.</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm406810272">Decades ago, some management theorists argued that a conscientious manager in a for-profit setting acts ethically by emphasizing solely the maximization of earnings. Today, most commentators contend that ethical business leadership is grounded in doing right by all stakeholders directly affected by a firm’s operations, including, but not limited to, <span data-type="term">stockholder</span><strong data-effect="bold">s</strong>, or those who own shares of the company’s stock. That is, business leaders do right when they give thought to what is best for <em data-effect="italics">all</em> who have a stake in their companies. Not only that, firms actually reap greater material success when they take such an approach, especially over the long run.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm406716464">Nobel Prize–winning economist Milton <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Friedman</span> stated in a now-famous <em data-effect="italics">New York Times Magazine</em> article in 1970 that the only “social responsibility of a business is to increase its profits.”<a href="#auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_rf-001" data-type="cite" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_rf-001-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_1"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> This concept took hold in business and even in business school education. However, although it is certainly permissible and even desirable for a company to pursue profitability as a goal, managers must also have an understanding of the context within which their business operates and of how the wealth they create can add positive value to the world. The context within which they act is society, which permits and facilitates a firm’s existence.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm406680208">Thus, a company enters a <span data-type="term">social contract</span> with society as whole, an implicit agreement among all members to cooperate for social benefits. Even as a company pursues the maximizing of stockholder profit, it must also acknowledge that all of society will be affected to some extent by its operations. In return for society’s permission to incorporate and engage in business, a company owes a reciprocal obligation to do what is best for as many of society’s members as possible, regardless of whether they are stockholders. Therefore, when applied specifically to a business, the social contract implies that a company gives back to the society that permits it to exist, benefiting the community at the same time it enriches itself.</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm400414080">What happens when a bank decides to break the social contract? This <a href="https://openstax.org/l/53Birken">press conference held by the National Whistleblowers Center</a> describes the events surrounding the $104 million whistleblower reward given to former UBS employee Bradley Birkenfeld by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. While employed at UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, Birkenfeld assisted in the company’s illegal offshore tax business, and he later served forty months in prison for conspiracy. But he was also the original source of incriminating information that led to a Federal Bureau of Investigation examination of the bank and to the U.S. government’s decision to impose a $780 million fine on UBS in 2009. In addition, Birkenfeld turned over to investigators the account information of more than 4,500 U.S. private clients of UBS.<a href="#auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_rf-002" data-type="cite" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_rf-002-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_2"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
</div>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm398741024">In addition to taking this more nuanced view of profits, managers must also use a different time frame for obtaining them. Wall Street’s focus on periodic (i.e., quarterly and annual) earnings has led many managers to adopt a short-term perspective, which fails to take into account effects that require a longer time to develop. For example, charitable donations in the form of corporate assets or employees’ volunteered time may not show a return on investment until a sustained effort has been maintained for years. A <span data-type="term">long-term perspective</span> is a more balanced view of profit maximization that recognizes that the impacts of a business decision may not manifest for a longer time.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm413284464">As an example, consider the business practices of Toyota when it first introduced its vehicles for sale in the United States in 1957. For many years, Toyota was content to sell its cars at a slight loss because it was accomplishing two business purposes: It was establishing a long-term relationship of trust with those who eventually would become its loyal U.S. customers, and it was attempting to disabuse U.S. consumers of their belief that items made in Japan were cheap and unreliable. The company accomplished both goals by patiently playing its long game, a key aspect of its operational philosophy, “The Toyota Way,” which includes a specific emphasis on long-term business goals, even at the expense of short-term profit.<a href="#auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_rf-003" data-type="cite" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_rf-003-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_3"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm407027232">What contributes to a corporation’s positive image over the long term? Many factors contribute, including a reputation for treating customers and employees fairly and for engaging in business honestly. Companies that act in this way may emerge from any industry or country. Examples include Fluor, the large U.S. engineering and design firm; illycaffè, the Italian food and beverage purveyor; Marriott, the giant U.S. hotelier; and Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications retailer. The upshot is that when consumers are looking for an industry leader to patronize and would-be employees are seeking a firm to join, companies committed to ethical business practices are often the first to come to mind.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm409712720">Why should stakeholders care about a company acting above and beyond the ethical and legal standards set by society? Simply put, being ethical is simply good business. A business is profitable for many reasons, including expert management teams, focused and happy employees, and worthwhile products and services that meet consumer demand. One more and very important reason is that they maintain a company philosophy and mission to do good for others.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm401167552">Year after year, the nation’s most admired companies are also among those that had the highest profit margins. Going green, funding charities, and taking a personal interest in employee happiness levels adds to the bottom line! Consumers want to use companies that care for others and our environment. During the years 2008 and 2009, many unethical companies went bankrupt. However, those companies that avoided the “quick buck,” risky and unethical investments, and other unethical business practices often flourished. If nothing else, consumer feedback on social media sites such as Yelp and Facebook can damage an unethical company’s prospects.</p>

For our purposes here, let us say that success consists simply of achieving our goals. We each have the ability to choose the goals we hope to accomplish in business, of course, and, if we have chosen them with integrity, our goals and the actions we take to achieve them will be in keeping with our character.</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm401245312">The primary principle under which Buffett instructs managers to operate is: “Do nothing you would not be happy to have an unfriendly but intelligent reporter write about on the front page of a newspaper.”<a href="#auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_rf-005" data-type="cite" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_rf-005-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_7"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> This is a very simple and practical guide to encouraging ethical business behavior on a personal level.

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm414154352">Earlier in this chapter, we explained that stakeholders are all the individuals and groups affected by a business’s decisions. Among these stakeholders are stockholders (or <span data-type="term">shareholder</span><strong data-effect="bold">s</strong>), individuals and institutions that own stock (or shares) in a corporation. Understanding the impact of a business decision on the stockholder and various other stakeholders is critical to the ethical conduct of business. Indeed, prioritizing the claims of various stakeholders in the company is one of the most challenging tasks business professionals face. Considering only stockholders can often result in unethical decisions; the impact on all stakeholders must be considered and rationally assessed.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm411257456">Managers do sometimes focus predominantly on stockholders, especially those holding the largest number of shares, because these powerful individuals and groups can influence whether managers keep their jobs or are dismissed (e.g., when they are held accountable for the company’s missing projected profit goals). And many believe the sole purpose of a business is, in fact, to maximize stockholders’ short-term profits. However, considering only stockholders and short-term impacts on them is one of the most common errors business managers make. It is often in the long-term interests of a business <em data-effect="italics">not</em> to accommodate stockowners alone but rather to take into account a broad array of stakeholders and the long-term and short-term consequences for a course of action.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm412446864">Here is a simple strategy for considering all your stakeholders in practice. Divide your screen or page into three columns; in the first column, list all stakeholders in order of perceived priority (<a href="#auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_OSX_Ethics_01_02_Exercise" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Some individuals and groups play more than one role. For instance, some employees may be stockholders, some members of the community may be suppliers, and the government may be a customer of the firm. In the second column, list what you think each stakeholder group’s interests and goals are. For those that play more than one role, choose the interests most directly affected by your actions. In the third column, put the likely impact of your business decision on each stakeholder. This basic spreadsheet should help you identify all your stakeholders and evaluate your decision’s impact on their interests. If you would like to add a human dimension to your analysis, try assigning some of your colleagues to the role of stakeholders and reexamine your analysis.</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm401004240">The positive feeling stakeholders have for any particular company is called <span data-type="term">goodwill</span>, which is an important component of almost any business entity, even though it is not directly attributable to the company’s assets and liabilities. Among other intangible assets, goodwill might include the worth of a business’s reputation, the value of its brand name, the intellectual capital and attitude of its workforce, and the loyalty of its established customer base. Even being socially responsible generates goodwill. The ethical behavior of managers will have a positive influence on the value of each of those components. Goodwill cannot be earned or created in a short time, but it can be the key to success and profitability.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm401534320">A company’s name, its corporate logo, and its trademark will necessarily increase in value as stakeholders view that company in a more favorable light. A good reputation is essential for success in the modern business world, and with information about the company and its actions readily available via mass media and the Internet (e.g., on public rating sites such as Yelp), management’s values are always subject to scrutiny and open debate. These values affect the environment outside and inside the company. The <span data-type="term">corporate culture</span>, for instance, consists of shared beliefs, values, and behaviors that create the internal or organizational context within which managers and employees interact. Practicing ethical behavior at all levels—from CEO to upper and middle management to general employees—helps cultivate an ethical corporate culture and ethical employee relations.</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm403820832">Imagine that upon graduation you have the good fortune to be offered two job opportunities. The first is with a corporation known to cultivate a hard-nosed, no-nonsense business culture in which keeping long hours and working intensely are highly valued. At the end of each year, the company donates to numerous social and environmental causes. The second job opportunity is with a nonprofit recognized for a very different culture based on its compassionate approach to employee work-life balance. It also offers the chance to pursue your own professional interests or volunteerism during a portion of every work day. The first job offer pays 20 percent more per year.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm402117744"><strong data-effect="bold">Critical Thinking</strong></p>

<li>Which of these opportunities would you pursue and why?</li>
<li>How important an attribute is salary, and at what point would a higher salary override for you the nonmonetary benefits of the lower-paid position?</li>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm407201088">Positive goodwill generated by ethical business practices, in turn, generates long-term business success. As recent studies have shown, the most ethical and enlightened companies in the United States consistently outperform their competitors.<a href="#auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_rf-007" data-type="cite" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_rf-007-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_11"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Thus, viewed from the proper long-term perspective, conducting business ethically is a wise business decision that generates goodwill for the company among stakeholders, contributes to a positive corporate culture, and ultimately supports profitability.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm405070096">You can test the validity of this claim yourself. When you choose a company with which to do business, what factors influence your choice? Let us say you are looking for a financial advisor for your investments and retirement planning, and you have found several candidates whose credentials, experience, and fees are approximately the same. Yet one of these firms stands above the others because it has a reputation, which you discover is well earned, for telling clients the truth and recommending investments that seemed centered on the clients’ benefit and not on potential profit for the firm. Wouldn’t this be the one you would trust with your investments?</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm404768448">Or suppose one group of financial advisors has a long track record of giving back to the community of which it is part. It donates to charitable organizations in local neighborhoods, and its members volunteer service hours toward worthy projects in town. Would this group not strike you as the one worthy of your investments? That it appears to be committed to building up the local community might be enough to persuade you to give it your business. This is exactly how a long-term investment in community goodwill can produce a long pipeline of potential clients and customers.</p>

The company’s shares fell nearly 14 percent after the announcement, but few expect Equifax managers to be held liable for their mistakes, face any regulatory discipline, or pay any penalties for profiting from their actions. To make amends to customers and clients in the aftermath of the hack, the company offered free credit monitoring and identity-theft protection. On September 15, 2017, the company’s chief information officer and chief of security retired. On September 26, 2017, the CEO resigned, days before he was to testify before Congress about the breach. To date, numerous government investigations and hundreds of private lawsuits have been filed as a result of the hack.</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm397688224">If you truly appreciate the positions of your various stakeholders, you will be well on your way to understanding the concept of <span data-type="term">corporate social responsibility (CSR)</span>. CSR is the practice by which a business views itself within a broader context, as a member of society with certain implicit social obligations and environmental responsibilities. As previously stated, there is a distinct difference between legal compliance and ethical responsibility, and the law does not fully address all ethical dilemmas that businesses face. CSR ensures that a company is engaging in sound ethical practices and policies in accordance with the company’s culture and mission, above and beyond any mandatory legal standards. A business that practices CSR cannot have maximizing shareholder wealth as its sole purpose, because this goal would necessarily infringe on the rights of other stakeholders in the broader society. For instance, a mining company that disregards its corporate social responsibility may infringe on the right of its local community to clean air and water if it pursues only profit. In contrast, CSR places all stakeholders within a proper contextual framework.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm404453808">An additional perspective to take concerning CSR is that ethical business leaders opt to do <em data-effect="italics">good</em> at the same time that they do <em data-effect="italics">well.</em> This is a simplistic summation, but it speaks to how CSR plays out within any corporate setting. The idea is that a corporation is entitled to make money, but it should not only make money. It should also be a good civic neighbor and commit itself to the general prospering of society as a whole. It ought to make the communities of which it is part better at the same time it pursues legitimate profit goals. These ends are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible—indeed, praiseworthy—to strive for both. When a company approaches business in this fashion, it is engaging in a commitment to corporate social responsibility.</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm399113888">A long-term view of business success is critical for accurately measuring profitability. All the company’s stakeholders benefit from managers’ ethical conduct, which also increases a business’s goodwill and, in turn, supports profitability. Customers and clients tend to trust a business that gives evidence of its commitment to a positive long-term impact. By exercising corporate social responsibility, or CSR, a business views itself within a broader context, as a member of society with certain implicit social obligations and responsibility for its own effects on environmental and social well-being.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm409279664">
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm372754192">Business people sometimes apply different ethical standards in different contexts, especially if they are working in a culture different from the one in which they were raised or with coworkers from other traditions. If we look outside ourselves for ethical guidance, relying on the context in which we find ourselves, we can grow confused about what is ethical business behavior. Stakeholders then observe that the messages we send via our conduct lack a consistent ethical core, which can harm our reputation and that of the business. To avoid falling back on <span data-type="term">ethical relativism</span>, a philosophy according to which there is no right or wrong and what is ethical depends solely on the context, we must choose a coherent standard we can apply to all our interactions with others.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm386637232">Some people who adopt multiple ethical standards may choose to exhibit the highest standards with their families, because these are the people they most revere. In a business setting, however, this same person may choose to be an unethical actor whose sole goal is the ruthless accumulation of wealth by any means. Because work and family are not the only two settings in which we live our lives, such a person may behave according to yet another standard to competitors in a sporting event, to strangers on the street, or to those in his or her religious community.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm380610672">Although the ethical standard we adopt is always a choice, certain life experiences can have more profound effects on our choice than others. Among the most formative experiences are family upbringing and cultural traditions, broadly defined here to include religious and ethnic norms, the standard patterns of behavior within the context in which we live. Culture and family also influence each other because the family exists in and responds to its cultural context, as well as providing us with the bedrock for our deepest values. Regardless of this initial coding, however, we can choose the ethical standards we apply in the business context.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm372981984">Why should we choose a single ethical code for all the contexts in which we live? The Greek philosophers and later proponents of the normative ethical theories we discussed earlier would say that if you apply your reason to determine how to behave, it makes rational sense to abide by a single ethical code for all interactions with all persons in all contexts. By doing so, you maximize your ethical behavior no matter who the other party is. Furthermore, you have an internally consistent behavior for all family, friends, customers, clients, and anyone else with whom you interact. Thus, we need not choose different values in different contexts, and when people see us in different situations, they are more likely to trust us because they see we uphold the same values regardless of the context.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm384229840">Indeed, proponents of all the normative ethical theories would insist that the only rational choice is to have a single ethical standard. A deontologist would argue that you should adhere to particular duties in performing your actions, regardless of the parties with whom you interact. A utilitarian would say that any act you take should result in the greatest good for the greatest number. A virtue ethicist would state that you cannot be virtuous if you lack integrity in your behavior toward all.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm370672544">Adopting a consistent ethical standard is both selfless and in the manager’s self-interest. That is, would-be customers and clients are more likely to seek out a business that treats all with whom it interacts with honesty and fairness, believing that they themselves will be treated likewise by that firm. Similarly, business leaders who treat everyone in a trustworthy manner need never worry that they might not have impressed a potential customer, because they always engage in honorable commercial practices. A single standard of business behavior that emphasizes respect and good service appeals to all.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm356900816">Normative ethics is about discovering right and delineating it from wrong; it is a way to develop the rules and norms we use to guide meaningful decision-making. The ethics in our single code are not relative to the time, person, or place. In this world, we all wear different hats as we go about our daily lives as employees, parents, leaders, students. Being a truly ethical person requires that no matter what hat we wear, we exhibit a single ethical code and that it includes, among others, such universal principles of behavior as honesty, integrity, loyalty, fairness, respect for law, and respect for others.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm381679840">Yet another reason to adopt a universal ethical standard is the transparent character it nurtures in us. If a company’s leadership insists that it stands for honest business transactions at every turn, it cannot prosecute those who defraud the company and look the other way when its own officers do the same. Stakeholders recognize such hypocrisy and rightly hold it against the business’s leaders.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm370120160">Business leaders are not limited to only one of the normative ethical theories we have described, however. Virtue theory, utilitarianism, and deontology all have advantages to recommend them. Still, what should not change is a corporate commitment to not make exceptions in its practices when those favor the company at the expense of customers, clients, or other stakeholders.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm383044944">Moving from theory to daily life, we can also look at the way our reputation is established by the implicit and explicit messages we send to others. If we adopt ethical relativism, friends, family, and coworkers will notice that we use different standards for different contexts. This lack of consistency and integrity can alter their perception of us and likely damage our reputation.</p>

<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm379736688">Suppose you work in retail sales for an international clothing company. A perk of the job is an employee discount of 25 percent on all merchandise you purchase for personal use. Your cousin, who is always looking for a bargain, approaches you in the store one day and implores you to give him your employee discount on a $100 purchase of clothes for himself.</p>

<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm374660368">The adoption of a single ethical code is the mark of a professional of integrity and is supported by the reasoned approach of each of the normative theories of business ethics. When we consistently maintain the same values regardless of the context, we are more likely to engender trust among those with whom we interact.</p>

Without trust, which is a fundamental outcome of ethical behavior, not just business relationships but all relationships would collapse. To develop insight into our own concepts of ethics, this chapter looks at how ethical systems have developed over time, beginning with the distinction between ethics and the law.</p>

<p id="auto_193f2cff-9aaf-4529-a53f-a9d10bf9ae44_fs-idm197327408">Ethics are the standards of behavior to which we hold ourselves accountable in our personal and professional lives. Laws and regulations set the minimal standards by which society lives out those ethical norms. Because laws are minimal standards, it is not uncommon for an act to be legal but generally deemed unethical. The fact is that law and ethics are not always the same. Always, however, they are in dialogue, and each informs the other. The greatest challenge in business decision-making is moving beyond the letter of the law to create a culture of ethics (<a href="#auto_193f2cff-9aaf-4529-a53f-a9d10bf9ae44_OSX_Ethics_02_00_Justice" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm345988400">It would be hard to overstate the influence of ancient Athens on Western civilization. Athenian achievements in the arts, literature, and government have molded Western consciousness. Perennial themes, such as the search for individual identity and each person’s place in the world, appear in countless novels and Hollywood screenplays. The role of Athenian ethical theories in philosophy has been profound, and Athenian principles continue to be influential in contemporary philosophy. Ethics, as a form of applied philosophy, was a major focus among the leaders of ancient Athens, particularly teachers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. They taught that ethics was not merely what someone did but who someone was. Ethics was a function of being and, as the guiding principle for dealings with others, it naturally applied as well to the sensitive areas of money and commerce.</p>

<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm331420576">Like a modern metropolis, the city-state (<em data-effect="italics">polis</em>) of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Athens</span> in the fifth century BCE drew people from far afield who wanted a better life. For some, that life meant engaging in trade and commerce, thanks to the openness of the new democracy established under the lawgiver Cleisthenes in 508 BCE. Others were drawn to Athens’ incredibly rich architecture, poetry, drama, religious practices, politics, and schools of philosophy. Youth traveled there hoping to study with such brilliant teachers as the mathematicians Archimedes and Pythagoras; dramatists like Sophocles and Euripides; historians Herodotus and Thucydides; Hippocrates, the father of medicine; and, of course, the renowned but enigmatic philosopher Socrates. More than being the equivalent of rock stars of their day, these thinkers, scholars, and artists challenged youth to pursue truth, no matter the cost to themselves or their personal ambitions. These leaders were interested not in fame or even in personal development but in the creation of an ideal society. This was the Golden Age of ancient Greece, whose achievements were so profound and enduring that they have formed the pillars of Western civilization for nearly two and a half millennia.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm346154384">Philosophy, in particular, flourished during the Golden Age, with various schools of thought attempting to make sense of the natural and human worlds. The human world was thought to be grounded in the natural world but to transcend it in striking ways, the most obvious being humans use of reason and deliberation. Philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle tackled fundamental questions of human existence with such insight that their ideas have remained relevant and universal even at the dawn of artificial intelligence. As British mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947) observed, “the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.”<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-001" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-001-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_1"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm325177728">Why are the insights of these Greek philosophers still relevant today? One reason is their development of the ancient concept of <em data-effect="italics">virtue</em>. The person most closely associated with virtue in the West, and the development of what is now known as <span data-type="term">virtue ethics</span>—that is, an ethical system based upon the exercise of certain virtues (loyalty, honor, courage) emphasizing the formation of character—is Plato’s famous pupil <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Aristotle</span> (384–322 BCE) (<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_OSX_Ethics_02_01_Aristotle" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm340381296">For Aristotle, everything that exists has a purpose, or end, and has been designed to meet that end. For instance, the proper end of birds is to fly, that of fish to swim. Birds and fish have been designed with the appropriate means (feathers, fins) to achieve those ends. Teleology, from the Greek <em data-effect="italics">telos</em> meaning goal or aim, is the study of ends and the means directed toward those ends. What is the <em data-effect="italics">telos</em> of human beings? Aristotle believed it to be <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">eudaimonia</em></span>, or happiness. By this, he did not mean happiness in a superficial sense, such as having fun or being content. Rather, he equated happiness with human flourishing, which he believed could be attained through the exercise of the function that distinguishes humans from the natural world: reason.<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-002" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-002-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_3"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> For Aristotle, reason was supreme and best used to increase not wealth but character. “But what is happiness?” he asked. “If we consider what the function of man is, we find that happiness is a virtuous activity of the soul.”<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-003" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-003-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_4"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm325342272">However, because humans are endowed not only with reason but also with the capacity to act in an honorable and ethical manner, they may reject their end, either intentionally or by default. The great task of life, then, is to recognize and pursue happiness, no matter the constraints placed on the individual, the most dramatic of which are suffering and death. Birds and fish have little difficulty achieving their ends, and we can assume that much of this is due to their genetic coding. Because happiness might not be genetically encoded in human beings, they must learn how to be happy. How do they do that? According to Aristotle, <em data-effect="italics">eudaimonia</em> is achieved by leading a virtuous life, which is attained over time. “Happiness is a kind of activity; and an activity clearly is developed and is not a piece of property already in one’s possession.”<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-004" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-004-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_5"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm347859792">Aristotle identified two types of virtues, which the philosophical community of his day agreed were objective and not subjective. The two types were intellectual and moral. Intellectual virtues—including knowledge (<em data-effect="italics">epistḗmē</em>), wisdom (<em data-effect="italics">sophíā</em>), and, most importantly for Aristotle, prudence (<span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">phrónēsis</em></span>), or practical wisdom—served as guides to behavior; that is, a person acted prudently based on the wisdom gained over time through the ongoing acquisition and testing of knowledge. To give an oversimplified but practical application of Aristotelian thinking, a hiring manager acts prudently when assessing a pool of candidates based on knowledge of their backgrounds and on insight gained after years of working in that role. The manager may even use intuitive reason regarding a candidate, which Aristotle believed was another way of arriving at truth. Understood in this way, the manager’s intuition is an impression regarding character and someone’s potential fit in an organization. Among the intellectual virtues, prudence played the major role because it helped individuals avoid excess and deficiency and arrive at the <span data-type="term">golden mean</span> between the two. Prudence has been translated as “common sense” and “practical wisdom” and helps individuals make the right decision in the right way at the right time for the right reason. In Aristotle’s view, only the truly prudent person could possess all the moral virtues.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm340478912">The distinction Aristotle made is that the intellectual virtues are acquired purely through learning, whereas the moral virtues are acquired through practice and the development of habits. In contrast to the intellectual virtues, which focused on external acts, the moral virtues had to do with character. They included courage, self-control, liberality, magnificence, honor, patience, and amiability. Some of these virtues had different meanings in ancient Greece than they do today. “Liberal,” for instance, referred not to a political or economic stance but rather to an aspect of personality. Someone would be considered liberal who was open and sharing of him- or herself and his or her talents without fear of rejection or expectation of reciprocity. The paragon of these virtues was the magnanimous individual, someone for whom fame and wealth held little attraction.<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-005" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-005-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_6"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> This person had self-knowledge; was not rash, quick to anger, or submissive to others; and acted with self-respect, control, and prudence. The magnanimous individual achieved happiness by leading a life characterized by reason and will. He or she remained in control of self and did not hand over his or her authority—or moral agency—to others, whether in judgment or in decision-making. “So, magnanimity seems to be a sort of crown of the virtues, because it enhances them and is never found apart from them. This makes it hard to be truly magnanimous, because it is impossible without all-round excellence,” according to Aristotle.<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-006" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-006-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_7"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm363858240">The relationship between the intellectual and the moral virtues was not as clear cut as it may appear, however, because Aristotle believed that action preceded character. In other words, the primary way to change character was through consistent, intentional behavior in the direction of virtue. Aristotle gave the example of courage. A person was not courageous first and then went about performing acts of courage. Rather, courage resulted from incremental change, small steps taken over time that molded the person’s character. It relied on a recognition of justice, so that courage was directed toward the right end. The important task was developing the habit of leading the virtuous life. Anyone could do this; however, it was a discipline that had to be learned and practiced with dedication. We can see that this habit of virtue is especially relevant for business today, when the temptation to conform to an established organizational culture is overwhelming even when that culture may permit and even encourage questionable practices. Add the seductive power of money, and anyone’s courage might be tested.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm369082352">The most notable feature of virtue ethics is that it viewed the basic ethical unit—the fundamental agent of morality—as the individual, who lived out his or her worldview publicly. A life of virtue, therefore, took place in the economic and political spheres so that others might participate in and benefit from it. In Athenian society, it was important for business to be conducted competently and ethically. Even though Aristotle was suspicious of business, he acknowledged its importance in preserving and nurturing Athenian democracy. He also praised the creation of money to further the goal of justice, so that a shoemaker and a housebuilder, for instance, could trade their wares on an equal basis. Virtue in the marketplace was demonstrated through ethical behavior, according to Aristotle: “People do in fact seek their own good, and think that they are right to act in this way. It is from this belief that the notion has arisen that such people are prudent. Presumably, however, it is impossible to secure one’s own good independently of domestic and political science.”<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-007" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-007-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_8"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> This belief in the public nature of virtue was crucial for the flourishing of the city-state and also has implications for contemporary business, which must consider the individual, organization, industry, and society in its development and planning.</p>

<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm368669488">Just as time and place influence people’s perception of ethics, so is their understanding of democracy also subjective.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm340022912">You might be surprised to learn the Athenian version of democracy was significantly different from our own. For instance, although the word “democracy” comes from the Greek for people (<em data-effect="italics">dêmos</em>) and power (<em data-effect="italics">krátos</em>), only adult men who owned property could vote, and voting was direct; Athens was not a republic with elected representatives, like the United States. Resident aliens, or <em data-effect="italics">metics</em>—those who change their home—were not eligible for citizenship and could not vote. They had limited rights and their status was second class, although this did not stop many of them from attaining wealth and fame. They were often among the best artisans, craftspeople, and merchants in the city-state. Metics were able to conduct business in the marketplace (<em data-effect="italics">agora</em>) provided they paid special taxes yearly. One of the most famous was Aristotle, who was born outside Athens in northern Greece.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm355758640">Women, even those who were citizens, were not allowed to vote and had limited rights when it came to property and inheritance. Their primary function in Athenian society was the care and management of the home. “The Athenian woman must be the perfect Penelope—a partner to the husband, a guard of the house, and one who practices the virtues defined by her husband. Physical beauty was not to be a goal, nor was it even a primary valued attribute. Total dedication to the welfare of husband, children, and household was the ultimate virtue”<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-008" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-008-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_10"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> (<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_OSX_Ethics_02_01_Penelope" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

Slave traders, too, brought their “wares” to market. Slavery was a customary part of many cultures throughout the ancient world, from Persia to Arabia and Africa and China. In Athens and its surrounding area, it is estimated that during the Golden Age (fifth century BCE) there were 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics (non-native Athenians who still shared some of the benefits of citizenship), and 400,000 slaves.<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-009" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-009-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_12"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Despite the Athenian emphasis on virtue and honor, there was little or no objection to owning slaves, because they formed an indispensable part of the economy, providing the labor for agriculture and food production.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm339975776">Slavery persists even today. For instance, it is believed that nearly thirty million people worldwide are living and working as slaves, including three million in China and fourteen million in India.<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-010" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-010-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_13"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Servitude also exists for migrant workers forced to live and work in inhuman conditions without recourse to legal help or even the basic necessities of life.

<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm341742592">The common belief in ancient Greece that business and money were somehow tainted reflected Plato’s concept that the physical world was an imperfect expression, or shadow, of the ideal. Everything in the physical world was somehow less than the ideal, and this included the products of human thought and labor. For example, a cow exists in the physical world as an imperfect and temporary expression of the ideal essence of a cow, what we might call “cowness.” (This imperfection accounted for the many variations found in the earthly creature.) Business, as a human invention based on self-interest, also had no appreciable ideal or end. After all, what was the purpose of making money if not having more money? Any end beyond that was not evident. In other words, money existed simply to replicate itself and was fueled by avarice (the love of money) or greed (the love of material goods). “As for the life of the businessman, it does not give him much freedom of action. Besides, wealth is obviously not the good that we are seeking, because it serves only as a means; i.e., for getting something else,” said Aristotle.<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-012" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-012-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_15"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm348869760">Yet, business had an interesting effect that helped invigorate Athenian life and encouraged those engaged in it to be virtuous (or else risk their reputation). This effect was <em data-effect="italics">association</em>. Business was based on the free and fair exchange of goods, which brought not only items of merchandise into association with each other but also buyers, sellers, and public officials. The way to ensure ethically sound association was through the exercise of prudence, especially in its demand that people act not rashly but deliberately. This deliberative aspect of prudence provided a way for buyers, sellers, and everyone engaged in a transaction to act honorably, which was of the utmost importance. Honor was not only a foundational virtue but the cultural environment in which the ancient world existed. One of the worst offenses anyone could commit, whether man, woman, free, or slave, was to act in a dishonorable way. Of course, although acting deliberately does not guarantee that one is acting honorably, for Athenians, acting in a calculated way was not an indication of dishonor. Dishonorable acts included any that disturbed the basic order (<em data-effect="italics">dikē</em>) of life in which everyone had a role, including the gods.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm344458256">Interestingly, the Aristotelian approach to business did not condemn money making or the accumulation of riches. What concerned <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Aristotle</span>, particularly because of its harmful effects on the individual and the city-state, was greed. Aristotle considered greed an excess that tipped the scales of justice and led to scandal. Money might constitute the bait, but greed causes the person to reach out and grab as much as possible, falling into the trap of scandal. The Greeks considered the exercise of greed an irrational, and therefore ignoble, act. Only attention to honor and deliberative prudence could save someone from acting so foolishly.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm325466080">Honor in ancient Greece was not just an individual characteristic but also a function of the group to which an individual belonged, and the person derived self-esteem from membership in that group. Civic virtue consisted of honorable living in community. Business scandals today often arise not from conflicts of interest but from conflicts of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">honor</span> in which employees feel torn by their allegiance to a coworker, a supervisor, or the organization.<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-013" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-013-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_16"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Although few people would use the term honor to describe contemporary workplace culture or corporate mission, nearly everyone understands the importance of reputation and its impact, positive or negative, on a business. Reputation is no accident. It is the product of a culture formed by individual and group effort. That effort is directed, intentional, and ongoing.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm345915376">According to Aristotle, and later thinkers who expanded upon his work, such as thirteenth-century philosopher and theologian Thomas <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Aquinas</span>, to act dishonorably casts disrepute on all concerned. Ends and means had to be aligned, particularly in business, which provided people’s livelihoods and secured the economic health of the city-state. Acting honorably meant trying to be magnanimous in all transactions and rising above obsession with baser instincts. The honorable person was magnanimous, prudent, fair, and interested in self-advancement as long as it did not injure personal integrity or the body politic. The importance of prudence is evident because, said Aristotle, it is “concerned with human goods, i.e., things about which deliberation is possible; for we hold that it is the function of the prudent man to deliberate well; and nobody deliberates about things that cannot be otherwise, or that are not means toward an end, and that end is a practical good. And the man who is good at deliberation generally is the one who can aim, by the help of his calculation, at the best of the goods attainable.”<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-014" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-014-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_17"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm345817536">Aquinas further divided Aristotelian prudence into memory, reason, understanding, docility, shrewdness, foresight, circumspection, and caution.<a href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-015" data-type="cite" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-015-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_18"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> To use these qualities in a constructive way, a business person had to direct them toward an appropriate end, which applies to business today just as it did in fourth-century Athens. A merchant could not make money in a random way but had to keep the needs of customers in mind and conduct business with fair prices and fees. This exercise of prudence was part of the cosmic order that ensured the right management of the home, the marketplace, and civilization itself. Similarly, committing fraud or deception to achieve an end, even if that end were good or just, was not considered an honorable act. Only when ends and means were aligned and worked in harmony were those engaged in the transaction considered virtuous. This virtue, in turn, would lead to the happiness Aristotle envisioned and toward which his entire system of virtue ethics aimed.</p>

<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm343774320">Along with honor, justice—as depicted in the image at the beginning of this chapter—formed part of the cultural environment of Athenian society. Citizens often relied on litigation to settle disputes, particularly conflicts over business transactions, contracts, inheritance, and property. Justice existed in three forms, as it does today: legal, commutative, and distributive. In <em data-effect="italics">legal justice</em>, the city-state was responsible for establishing fair laws for the welfare of its citizens. <em data-effect="italics">Commutative justice</em> characterized relationships among individuals. Courts attempted to correct harms inflicted and return what had been unlawfully taken away from plaintiffs. <em data-effect="italics">Distributive justice</em> governed the duty of the city-state to distribute benefits and burdens equitably among the people.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm324878192">We can see these forms of justice at work today in very practical ways. For instance, within the framework of commutative justice, businesses are often held responsible ethically and financially for any harm caused by their products. And distributive justice is debated in such hotly contested issues as corporate and individual tax rates, universal health coverage, state and federal income assistance, subsidized housing, social security eligibility, college tuition aid (e.g., Pell grants), and similar programs designed to create a “safety net” for those least fortunate. Some safety net programs have been criticized for their excessive cost, inefficiency, and unfairness to those who pay into them while receiving no benefit or say in their administration.</p>

<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm366892000">The role of ethics in Athens during Greece’s Golden Age (fifth century BCE) was substantial. Aristotle focused on the role of virtue in developing individual character and social stability. He believed a person’s actions determined whether he or she was virtuous, and the point of the virtuous life was happiness, or <em data-effect="italics">eudaimonia</em>.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm324836448">Aristotle identified two types of virtues: intellectual and moral. Intellectual virtues were acquired through learning and served as guides to behavior by helping the individual discover truth. Moral virtues were acquired through habit and built character by helping someone pursue what is beneficial and avoid what is harmful in daily life. Aristotle considered <em data-effect="italics">phrónēsis</em>, or prudence, the most important virtue, because of its practical application.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm341665280">The thirteenth-century philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas agreed with Aristotle that to act dishonorably casts disrepute on all concerned. Ends and means had to be aligned, particularly in business, which provided people’s livelihoods and secured the economic health of the city-state.</p>

<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm235419136">By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>

<li>Identify the key features of Confucian virtue ethics</li>
<li>Explain how Confucian virtue ethics can be applied to contemporary business</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm235164528">The teachings and writings of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Confucius</span> (551–479 BCE; also called Kung Fu Tzu or Master Kung) not only have endured more than two and a half millennia but have influenced Chinese culture to such a degree that they remain part of the national character. In classical Confucianism, the practice of virtue constitutes the essence of governance. Differing from Aristotelian virtue (<em data-effect="italics">arête</em>), Confucian virtue emphasizes relationships. Aristotle shows how a self-determining person might live well in society. Confucius showed how a relationship-determining person can live well with others. The reasons for this distinction will become clearer throughout the section.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm231219744">As an iconic figure, Confucius had an impact on politics, literature, civil administration, diplomacy, and religion in China. Yet, by most accounts, he considered himself a failure, never having achieved the position and security he sought during his lifetime. However, his story is a testament to the reward of a life lived with integrity and simplicity.</p>

<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm238942528">More than a century and a half before Aristotle and on the other side of the globe, Confucius, a wandering preacher from the principality of Lu in China, also struggled to answer life’s questions, although in a practical rather than a philosophical way. Confucius committed himself to healing the social divisions that were tearing China apart under the declining Zhou Dynasty. Those divisions led to what historians call the “Period of the Warring States,” which persisted for two hundred years after Confucius’s death. It was a time of constant warfare and violence.<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-001" data-type="cite" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-001-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_1"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> To counter the social disintegration he found everywhere, Confucius looked to the past, or “the wisdom of the ancients.” He called for a “return to <em data-effect="italics"><strong data-effect="bold">li</strong></em>,” which was the proper order of the universe in which everyone had a role to play and there was harmony in the world.<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-002" data-type="cite" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-002-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_2"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm232029632">We might see this harmony in a contemporary business setting as a team of people bringing different talents to bear on a specific project for the good (and profit) of the company. In this sense, <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">li</em></span> refers to doing those tasks in collaboration with others to achieve the mission of the organization. For Confucius, <em data-effect="italics">li</em> was expressed through ritual acts. When the correct rituals were followed in the right way with the right intention for the right end, all was well. Of course, corporate rituals also exist, and like all ritual acts, they reinforce cohesion and identity within the group. Identifying them helps improve employee awareness, productivity, and, perhaps, happiness. One example of this would be new-employee orientation, which is intended to acclimate newcomers to the corporate culture, the company ethos, and the traditions associated with the way the firm does business. Finally, anticipating Aristotle’s golden mean, <em data-effect="italics">li</em> emphasized the middle ground between deficiency and excess. “Nothing in excess” was its guiding principle.<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-003" data-type="cite" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-003-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_3"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm236886368">Huston Smith, noted historian of world religions, has observed that the widespread adoption of Confucius’s teachings within a generation of his death was not due to the originality of his ideas.<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-004" data-type="cite" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-004-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_4"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> What made the humble scholar the greatest cultural force in China’s history was chance. Confucius appeared on the scene at the right time, offering a fractured country an alternative to two extremes, neither of which was working. These were a realism that was tyrannical and relied on brute force to restrain the rivaling factions, and an idealistic approach called Mohism that was based on universal love and mutual aid. Confucius rejected the first as crude and the second as utopian.<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-005" data-type="cite" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-005-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_5"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Instead, he offered a practical but empathetic approach, a sort of tough love for the times.</p>

<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm237731552">Scholars believe that, like Aristotle, Confucius stressed the virtuous life in his ethical system, with the goal of creating a <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">junzi</em></span>, or a person who was gracious, magnanimous, and cultured: in other words, a flourishing human being. A <em data-effect="italics">junzi</em> exhibited refinement, self-control, and balance in all things, acting neither rashly nor timidly. Such a person was the opposite of a “small” individual, who spent his or her time embroiled in petty rivalries and for whom power was the ultimate measure of success.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm238691328">The concept of <em data-effect="italics">junzi</em> and the Aristotelian magnanimous individual have much in common, except that for Confucius, there was added urgency. To be a <em data-effect="italics">junzi</em> was a matter not just of honor but of survival. It is no exaggeration to say that China’s very existence depended upon the ability of individuals—nobles and peasants alike—to rise above the barbarity around them and embrace a way of life directed both outward toward social, political, and administrative reform and inward toward spiritual development. Confucius (<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_OSX_Ethics_02_02_Confucius" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) believed that living the virtues he taught would achieve both these ends.</p>

<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm239036992">The keystone of Confucius’s deliberate tradition was the <em data-effect="italics">dao</em> of humanity, or the Way, which established humanity as the answer to rampant lawlessness.<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-006" data-type="cite" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-006-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_7"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Confucius believed people were inherently good and that the way to stop inhuman behavior was to make them even better, or more human. He identified three means to do this, which we explore next: “whole-hearted sincerity and truthfulness,” the “constant mean,” and “expediency” (<em data-effect="italics">quan</em>).<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-007" data-type="cite" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-007-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_8"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Specific virtues like moral character, righteousness, wisdom, courage, respect, filial piety, and simplicity formed part of these means. Someone who lived virtuously became more human, which resulted in a flourishing individual and an ordered world.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm227732800">“Whole-hearted sincerity and truthfulness” meant more than sincerity, because even liars can be convincing. The sincerity Confucius had in mind was closer to loyalty, and the thing to which humans had to be loyal was truth. Confucius intended to counter the blind loyalty that had contributed to the eruption of anarchy throughout China. For instance, if a subject were called upon to offer advice, the subject had to be truthful, even though the ruler might not like the advice, which actually happened to Confucius, causing him to resign his post as minister of justice in Lu.<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-008" data-type="cite" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-008-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_9"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> What a subject owed the ruler was not cloying deference but the truth, which would benefit everyone in the long run. The implications for ethical behavior in modern corporations may be obvious. Reporting unethical behavior as a whistleblower or even standing up for truth in a meeting is sometimes easier said than done, which is why living virtuously requires disciplined practice and the support of like-minded individuals.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm231206976">The “constant mean” refers to balance between excess and deficiency in an existential and in a practical sense. We are to follow the middle path, avoiding extremes of thought and action through ritual acts. We cannot claim to lead a balanced life; we must show it by performing acts that maintain personal and collective order. The <em data-effect="italics">Book of Li</em> catalogues many of these acts, which form a guide for proper living, indicating the correct way to maintain the five great relationships that support Chinese society: parent/child, husband/wife, elder/junior sibling, master/apprentice, and ruler/subject. Confucius and his peers believed that properly observing these key five relationships was essential for social good and would invoke divine favor on the people.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm228066880">Note that three of these are relationships within the family. The family was the basic unit of society and Confucius’s hope for reform, because it was the primary and most influential school of character, virtue, and conscience. Thus, the return to <em data-effect="italics">li</em> takes on greater significance than a simple longing for an idyllic past. As Huston Smith noted, “that three of the Five Relationships pertain within the family is indicative of how important Confucius considered this institution to be. In this he was not inventing but continuing the Chinese assumption that the family is the basic unit of society. This assumption is graphically embedded in Chinese legend, which credits the hero who ‘invented’ the family with elevating the Chinese from the animal to human level.”<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-009" data-type="cite" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-009-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_10"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm228052400" class="what-would"><div data-type="title" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_11">Yijing</div>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm235484336">The five great relationships upon which Chinese civilization is built prescribed definite roles for the social classes and sexes. As in ancient Greece, women in ancient China were in charge of domestic duties and care of the family. They were neither expected nor believed able to assume duties outside the home and certainly not in the competitive world of business. Yet consider the fictional case of Yijing.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm234861984">Yijing was the daughter of the merchant Bei Li, who sold farming tools and agricultural products in Cao, which bordered Lu. Bei Li’s business was very successful and he took great pride in it. He had three sons who worked with him, but none had the head for business that his daughter Yijing had. Moreover, none of them wanted to take over the business after his death. When Yijing begged for a chance to run the business for her father, he agreed, but he insisted she disguise herself as a man when traveling and doing business in the family name. If people knew she was a woman, they would ridicule the family and take advantage of her. Although surprised by her father’s request, Yijing agreed and eventually took over the business, making it extremely prosperous.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm238617920"><strong data-effect="bold">Critical Thinking</strong></p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm231539952">If you were Yijing, what would you have done?</p>
</div>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm237119728">For Confucius, the third approach to the Way of humanity was the doctrine of expediency. Where Buddhism and Taoism advocated compassion and Mohism advocated universal love, Confucianism defined righteousness as the virtue that would temper compassion and love so that people could live together not just peacefully but justly.<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-010" data-type="cite" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-010-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_12"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Righteousness included a practical approach to problem solving that helped politics, diplomacy, and civil administration to flourish. This expediency, or <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">quan</em></span>, is a noteworthy feature of Confucianism. Originally referring to a piece of metal used in balancing scales, <em data-effect="italics">quan</em> is applied when weighing options in a moral dilemma and acts as a counterbalance to achieve fairness, enabling parties in a transaction to arrive at an equitable agreement. Ultimately, <em data-effect="italics">quan</em> allows people and institutions to prioritize responsive action over ritual and serves as the way to align what people do with who they are, thus allowing them to become more human. For the businessperson, it might mean not fleeing the “tawdry” world of the marketplace but recognizing the humanity within it.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm223434992">One example of the use of <em data-effect="italics">quan</em> is the Broad Group, a Chinese manufacturer of central air conditioning products. The company produces clean energy systems and has developed an alternative to Freon. The new coolant has changed the way energy is delivered to such an extent that Zhang Yue, the company’s chief executive officer, was awarded the Champions of the Earth prize by the United Nations in 2011 for his work in green energy.<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-011" data-type="cite" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-011-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_13"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Certainly, there is more opportunity for sustainable manufacturing and ethical business practices throughout China, and the state is attempting to promote such efforts.</p>

<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm234767520">The spirituality that emerges from <em data-effect="italics">quan</em> as righteousness is not solely about the individual; it is about the act itself, that is, the transaction, whether that takes place in a market, shop, or loading dock. When righteousness is directed outward in this way, it becomes justice, compelling all parties in a transaction to act in good faith or risk upsetting the proper order of things. Justice in this sense allows for wealth creation, investment, and strategic planning as long as all fulfill their roles and act in the manner of a <em data-effect="italics">junzi</em>. An overarching spirituality of business may even develop, arising from the people who collectively make up the company. This is a traditionally Confucian way of looking at corporate culture, as the reflection of a larger network of relationships.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm232837088">The other two Confucian ways of humanity also relate to business, because wholeheartedness and sincerity can serve as models of risk assessment, requiring clearheaded thinking and action balanced with respect for markets, competitors, and stakeholders. The <em data-effect="italics">dao</em> of humanity rejects the premise that greed reigns supreme by itself. Instead, its ethical counterpart is truth. Both qualities exist within business practices. In this ethical framework, loyalty to truth is not just a stock phrase but a commitment to value in all aspects of an enterprise, such as sales, finance, marketing, and the employment and hiring chain. An investment advisor might recommend the constant mean to clients so their money is in a diversified portfolio with a long-term strategy.

<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm217537152">Some have criticized Confucianism for impeding progress in China in areas like education, the natural sciences, and business, because it has failed to adapt to the modern context. High-frequency trading, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and robotics do not work with cultural values thousands of years old, these critics say, so what we need is a new consciousness for a new era in human history. However, these criticisms miss the point. Confucius was interested in the same thing that concerned Aristotle—namely, the character of the person or persons making decisions rather than the decisions themselves. The importance of character has been proven repeatedly through business scandals like Enron, LIBOR, and the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the recent problems of Uber and Volkswagen, in which personal irresponsibility resulted in disaster. Indeed, business schools now offer seminars for executives integrating virtue ethics—both Aristotelian- and Confucian-inspired models—in leadership development.</p>

<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm217554992">The recent campaign of China’s central government against unethical business practices has made a point of prosecuting executives for corruption in the form of bribery, kickbacks, and embezzlement, demonstrating that some Confucian thought has survived from ancient times. Jack Ma, cofounder of the giant Chinese ecommerce site Alibaba, has called this “clean communism,” which might be another way of characterizing the form of state-sponsored capitalism that exists in China.<a href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-012" data-type="cite" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-012-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_15"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Of course, the former Communist regime did not embrace Confucian virtue. Mao Zedong was deeply suspicious of Confucius, holding him to be a relic of the Imperial Era and having little value for the new China he intended to create with the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949.</p>

<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm236771952">Confucius (551–479 BCE) attempted to revise ancient Chinese traditions and mores to counter the social chaos of his times. His system of virtue ethics emphasized relationships and, when followed faithfully, led to the <em data-effect="italics">dao</em> of humanity, that is, true harmonious living. There were three ways to achieve <em data-effect="italics">dao</em>: “whole-hearted sincerity and truthfulness,” the “constant mean,” and “expediency” (<em data-effect="italics">quan</em>). Someone who lived virtuously became more humane, which resulted in a flourishing individual and an ordered nation.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm229408096">In Confucian virtue ethics, business was viewed as a network of relationships dependent on trust and righteousness. Righteousness was a form of justice that compelled everyone to act in good faith. Considered in this way, justice allows for wealth creation, investment, and strategic planning as long as everyone fulfills his or her role and acts in accordance with the basic pattern of relationships Confucius identified.</p>

For Aristotle, happiness consisted of the search for truth, which, in turn, required a centered, stable individual who could surmount misfortune or weak character. Confucius looked to settle the soul of the Chinese people by creating a system that reflected the heavenly order on Earth. Both systems rely on reasoned means to achieve reasoned ends.</p>

<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm235223152">Given the vastly different cultural and historical settings of ancient Greece and China, you may be surprised to find similarities between the Aristotelian and Confucian systems of virtue ethics. Yet not only are there similarities but the two systems share the theme of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">control</span>. For Aristotle, control manifested itself through the deliberative process of <em data-effect="italics">phrónēsis</em>, resulting in virtuous living, harmony, and happiness. This application of practical wisdom was related to self-restraint, or temperance. In Confucian virtue ethics, control was a function of self-regulation; primitive instincts were held at bay and the person gained the capacity and courage to act more humanely (<a href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_OSX_Ethics_02_03_Control" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). This achievement of control benefited not only the individual but also the family and, by extension, the nation. Self-regulation was Confucius’s way of establishing order.</p>

<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm223389552">In a business context, control bears directly on <span data-type="term">managerial ethics</span>, which is a way of relating to self, employees, and the organization that balances individual and collective responsibility, and in which management also includes planning, organizing, and leading to achieve organizational goals.<a href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-001" data-type="cite" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-001-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_2"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> A self-controlled, disciplined manager is able to work through layers of bureaucracy and the complexities of human interaction to attain goals in a way that is responsible and profitable and that enhances the organization’s mission and culture. These goals are achieved not at the expense of stakeholders but in a way that is fair for all. We might even say that righteousness leads to justice, which includes profit. We saw earlier that neither Aristotle nor Confucius disapproved of profit as long as it benefitted humanity in some way. Both men would have a very definite opinion about the optimization of shareholder wealth.</p>
<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm234752448">Despite these similarities between the two traditions, there are differences—the most notable being the locus of ethics. Aristotle placed this locus on individuals, who were called to fulfill their purpose honorably, accepting fate with dignity and aplomb. The basis of this acceptance was reason. For Confucius, reflecting the historical plight of China, the locus was the family, which he envisioned as putting an end to anarchy and setting the nation on its proper course by providing the basic pattern of relationships for personal and professional life. To be sure, family counted for Aristotle just as the individual counted for Confucius, but the emphasis in each system was different. Aristotle acknowledged that “a solitary man has a hard life, because it is not easy to keep up a continuous activity by oneself; but in company with others and in relation to others it is easier.”<a href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-002" data-type="cite" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-002-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_3"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm236768672">Regardless of the source of ethical behavior, those engaged in business were required to act with accountability and responsibility. They were accountable to customers and suppliers when delivering commodities like figs, pottery, or olive oil. And they had to conduct themselves responsibly to maintain their personal and professional reputation. Thus, business was the perfect expression of ethics in both East and West, because it provided a forum within which virtues were tested in very real ways. Confucius urged each follower to be a great or humane person, or <em data-effect="italics">ru</em>, not a small one.<a href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-003" data-type="cite" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-003-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_4"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> This was so important that the school established after his death was known as the Ru School, and the principles it taught are called Ruism.<a href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-004" data-type="cite" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-004-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_5"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm237334464">Another important characteristic of Eastern and Western systems of virtue ethics is the integration of personal and professional life. A person could not act one way at home and a completely different way in public, especially civic leaders, merchants, teachers, and rulers. The modern tendency to compartmentalize various aspects of ourselves to accommodate circumstances would have puzzled those living in ancient Greece or China. A retail manager who contributes generously to help protect endangered species but thinks nothing of working the sales staff to the point of burnout to achieve monthly goals has not successfully integrated the personal and the professional, for instance, and even poses obstacles to individual happiness and life in the community. Everyone desires efficiency in business, but compartmentalizing our personal and professional ideals can lead to “dispersed personal accountability” in an organization and the kind of financial meltdown that occurred, through greed and rule-breaking, in the housing and financial industries and led to the worldwide recession of 2008.<a href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-005" data-type="cite" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-005-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_6"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm224008480">What might the integration of personal and professional life look like, and how can we apply it within the relationships that are the foundation of business? To answer this question, consider the essence of the virtuous person that each ethical system strove to create. For Aristotle, the virtuous person saw the truth in every kind of situation. Once acknowledged and recognized, the truth could not be denied without compromising honor. Similarly, Confucius taught that “A gentleman will not, for the space of a meal, depart from humanity. In haste and flurry, he adheres to it; in fall and stumble, he adheres by it.”<a href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-006" data-type="cite" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-006-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_7"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm228173456">Despite the emphasis these systems placed on character, however, character was not ultimately what defined the virtuous individual, family, city-state, or nation. Instead, it was the individual’s transformation, through education, into a different kind of being who will act virtuously even if no one is watching. When the person concentrates on the means used to achieve an end, eventually the means become a way of life even more important than the end itself. It is not merely that the means must match the end, but that they come to define the virtuous person.</p>
<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm236614048">The integration of personal and professional lives has two effects: <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">motive</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">awareness</span>. Motive is the willingness to do the right thing because it is the right thing, even though there may be no perceived benefit. Arguably, it is here that the individual’s true nature is revealed. The other effect, awareness, is the ability to see the ethical dimension in all events, choices, decisions, and actions. Many business scandals could be avoided if more people understood the value of human capital and the need to see the larger picture; to put it differently: responsibility over profitability. Or, as Confucius would say, it is the person who can broaden the Way, not the Way that broadens the person.<a href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-007" data-type="cite" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-007-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_8"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm237995136">A fundamental question in the study of ethics is whether we can identify universal, objective moral truths that cut across cultures, geographic settings, and time. At the most foundational level, the answer might be yes. As Aristotle noted, ethics is not a science but an art.<a href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-008" data-type="cite" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-008-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_9"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Perhaps the best way to answer the question is to consider the methods used for moral decision-making. This strategy would be in line with Aristotelian and Confucian models if we assume that once they attain insight, most people will follow their conscience and act in reasonable, responsible ways. Methods of decision-making then could be adapted to any context or dilemma. But what constitutes a reasonable, responsible method, and who gets to choose it?</p>
<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm238939920">It is possible that standards of ethical conduct could be created to guide business affairs fairly and justly. Such standards already exist in most industries and professions. The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) give direction to those working in accounting and finance in the United States. The International Standards Organization offers guidelines and protocols for many industries. Together with governmental regulation, these might serve as the basis for ethical behavior, perhaps even globally. Of course, those fashioning guidelines would have to be sensitive to individual autonomy and national sovereignty, especially when it comes to international jurisdiction, privacy, and human rights. For example, the International Financial Reporting Standards serve as a kind of international GAAP to help companies report financial results in a common accounting language across national boundaries.</p>
<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm234757360">Despite our best efforts, someone who wishes to conduct business selfishly and unethically always will be drawn to do so unless given a compelling incentive not to. It is evident why Aristotle and Confucius stressed the importance of schooling. Perhaps what is needed now, building on these two ancient approaches, is business education focused on transformation rather than on conformity to guidelines. This proposal touches the core of both Aristotelian and Confucian teachings: training and education. Training and education help internalize in us more altruistic business practices. They also permit greater integration between our personal and professional understandings of the way we should treat friends, family, customers, and clients. No matter the context, we are then encouraged to treat others with honesty and respect, so that even someone certain to get away with the most outrageous corruption or money-laundering scheme would not do it. Why not? Because doing so would be a betrayal of the person’s conscience and identity. A business education that is truly effective—one for the twenty-first century—would produce a graduate who could stand up and say no to that kind of self-betrayal.</p>

<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm227871024">Imagine a scenario in which Aristotle and Confucius sit down to discuss Chiquita Brands International, a global produce conglomerate that paid “protection” money to right-wing and Marxist guerrilla groups in Colombia between 1997 and 2004 to ensure there would be no violence against its employees, banana plantations, and facilities. The payment violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (1977), which prohibits bribes and kickbacks to foreign officials. Chiquita claimed it was the victim of extortion and had no choice. However, for its actions, it eventually paid $25 million in fines to the U.S. government. In 2007, a group of Colombians filed a lawsuit against the company under the Alien Tort Claims Act, alleging that, because of its illegal payments, Chiquita was “complicit in extrajudicial killings, torture, forced disappearances, and crimes against humanity” perpetrated against plantation workers by the guerilla “death squads.”<a href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-009" data-type="cite" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-009-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_11"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015, but the Court declined to hear it.</p>

<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm237971840">Aristotle and Confucius each constructed an ethical system based on virtue, with Aristotle’s anticipated result being happiness and Confucius’s being harmony. For Aristotle, happiness consisted of the search for truth. Confucius looked to create a system that put an end to civil chaos. Although both systems relied on reason and control to achieve their ends, Aristotle placed the locus of ethical behavior on individuals, but he held that a moral upbringing and good political governance also contributed to the formation of moral character. Confucius saw this locus in the family, which provided the basic pattern of relationships for personal and professional life. Reason prevailed throughout, as in the cultivation of a more just and humane person.</p>
<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm227880672">In a business context, reason and control bear directly on management, leadership, and corporate culture. They constitute a way of cultivating individual virtue and corporate ethos such that the two go hand in hand. The environment or culture of an organization needs individuals of character who can follow their conscience and experience moral conversion. We might envision the emergence of universal values like reason and control that nurture both the individual and the organization.</p>

<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm231285232">Although the ultimate aim of Aristotelian virtue ethics was <em data-effect="italics">eudaimonia</em>, later philosophers began to question this notion of happiness. If happiness consists of leading the good life, what is good? More importantly, who decides what is good? Jeremy <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bentham</span> (1748–1842), a progressive British philosopher and jurist of the Enlightenment period, advocated for the rights of women, freedom of expression, the abolition of slavery and of the death penalty, and the decriminalization of homosexuality. He believed that the concept of good could be reduced to one simple instinct: the search for pleasure and the avoidance of pain. All human behavior could be explained by reference to this basic instinct, which Bentham saw as the key to unlocking the workings of the human mind. He created an ethical system based on it, called <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">utilitarianism</span>. Bentham’s protégé, John Stuart Mill (1806–1873), refined Bentham’s system by expanding it to include human rights. In so doing, Mill reworked Bentham’s utilitarianism in some significant ways. In this section we look at both systems.</p>

<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm232383712">During Bentham’s lifetime, revolutions occurred in the American colonies and in France, producing the Bill of Rights and the <em data-effect="italics">Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme</em> (Declaration of the Rights of Man), both of which were based on liberty, equality, and self-determination. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published <em data-effect="italics">The Communist Manifesto</em> in 1848. Revolutionary movements broke out that year in France, Italy, Austria, Poland, and elsewhere.<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-001" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-001-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_1"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> In addition, the Industrial Revolution transformed Great Britain and eventually the rest of Europe from an agrarian (farm-based) society into an industrial one, in which steam and coal increased manufacturing production dramatically, changing the nature of work, property ownership, and family. This period also included advances in chemistry, astronomy, navigation, human anatomy, and immunology, among other sciences.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm235320720">Given this historical context, it is understandable that Bentham used reason and science to explain human behavior. His ethical system was an attempt to quantify happiness and the good so they would meet the conditions of the scientific method. Ethics had to be empirical, quantifiable, verifiable, and reproducible across time and space. Just as science was beginning to understand the workings of cause and effect in the body, so ethics would explain the causal relationships of the mind. Bentham rejected religious authority and wrote a rebuttal to the Declaration of Independence in which he railed against natural rights as “rhetorical nonsense, nonsense upon stilts.”<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-002" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-002-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_2"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Instead, the fundamental unit of human action for him was <em data-effect="italics">utility</em>—solid, certain, and factual.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm232536960">What is utility? Bentham’s fundamental axiom, which underlies <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">utilitarianism</span>, was that all social morals and government legislation should aim for producing the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. Utilitarianism, therefore, emphasizes the consequences or ultimate purpose of an act rather than the character of the actor, the actor’s motivation, or the particular circumstances surrounding the act. It has these characteristics: (1) universality, because it applies to all acts of human behavior, even those that appear to be done from altruistic motives; (2) objectivity, meaning it operates beyond individual thought, desire, and perspective; (3) rationality, because it is not based in metaphysics or theology; and (4) quantifiability in its reliance on utility.<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-003" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-003-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_3"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm234720096">In the spirit of utilitarianism, Jeremy Bentham made a seemingly bizarre request concerning the disposition of his body after his death. He generously donated half his estate to London University, a public university open to all and offering a secular curriculum, unusual for the times. (It later became University College London.) Bentham also stipulated that his body be preserved for medical instruction (<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_OSX_Ethics_02_04_Bentham" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) and later placed on display in what he called an “auto-icon,” or self-image. The university agreed, and Bentham’s body has been on display ever since. Bentham wanted to show the importance of donating one’s remains to medical science in what was also perhaps his last act of defiance against convention. Critics insist he was merely eccentric.</p>

</div>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm238824016">Bentham was interested in reducing utility to a single index so that units of it could be assigned a numerical and even monetary value, which could then be regulated by law. This <span data-type="term">utility function</span> measures in “utils” the value of a good, service, or proposed action relative to the utilitarian principle of the greater good, that is, increasing happiness or decreasing pain. Bentham thus created a “hedonic calculus” to measure the utility of proposed actions according to the conditions of intensity, duration, certainty, and the probability that a certain consequence would result.<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-004" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-004-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_6"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> He intended utilitarianism to provide a reasoned basis for making judgments of value rather than relying on subjectivity, intuition, or opinion. The implications of such a system on law and public policy were profound and had a direct effect on his work with the British House of Commons, where he was commissioned by the Speaker to decide which bills would come up for debate and vote. Utilitarianism provided a way of determining the total amount of utility or value a proposal would produce relative to the harm or pain that might result for society.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm227841728">Utilitarianism is a consequentialist theory. In <span data-type="term">consequentialism</span>, actions are judged solely by their consequences, without regard to character, motivation, or any understanding of good and evil and separate from their capacity to create happiness and pleasure. Thus, in utilitarianism, it is the consequences of our actions that determine whether those actions are right or wrong. In this way, consequentialism differs from Aristotelian and Confucian virtue ethics, which can accommodate a range of outcomes as long as the character of the actor is ennobled by virtue. For Bentham, character had nothing to do with the utility of an action. Everyone sought pleasure and avoided pain regardless of personality or morality. In fact, too much reliance on character might obscure decision-making. Rather than making moral judgments, utilitarianism weighed acts based on their potential to produce the most good (pleasure) for the most people. It judged neither the good nor the people who benefitted. In Bentham’s mind, no longer would humanity depend on inaccurate and outdated moral codes. For him, utilitarianism reflected the reality of human relationships and was enacted in the world through legislative action.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm233397648">To illustrate the concept of consequentialism, consider the hypothetical story told by Harvard psychologist Fiery Cushman. When a man offends two volatile brothers with an insult, Jon wants to kill him; he shoots but misses. Matt, who intends only to scare the man but kills him by accident, will suffer a more severe penalty than his brother in most countries (including the United States). Applying utilitarian reasoning, can you say which brother bears greater guilt for his behavior? Are you satisfied with this assessment of responsibility? Why or why not?<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-005" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-005-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_7"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm235126400">As you might expect, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">utilitarianism</span> was not without its critics. Thomas Hodgskin (1787–1869) pointed out what he said was the “absurdity” of insisting that “the rights of man are derived from the legislator” and not nature.<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-006" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-006-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_8"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> In a similar vein, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) accused Bentham of mixing up morality with law.<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-007" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-007-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_9"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Others objected that utilitarianism placed human beings on the same level as animals and turned people into utility functions. There were also complaints that it was mechanistic, antireligious, and too impractical for most people to follow. John Stuart <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Mill</span> sought to answer these objections on behalf of his mentor but then offered a synthesis of his own that brought natural rights together with utility, creating a new kind of utilitarianism, one that would eventually serve to underpin neoclassical economic principles.<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-008" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-008-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_10"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm237477616">Mill’s father, James, was a contemporary and associate of Bentham’s who made sure his son was tutored in a rigorous curriculum. According to Mill, at an early age he learned enough Greek and Latin to read the historians Herodotus and Tacitus in their original languages.<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-009" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-009-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_11"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> His studies also included algebra, Euclidean geometry, economics, logic, and calculus.<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-010" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-010-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_12"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> His father wanted him to assume a leadership position in Bentham’s political movement, known as the Philosophical Radicals.<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-011" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-011-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_13"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Unfortunately, the intensity and duration of Mill’s schooling—utilitarian conditions of education—were so extreme that he suffered a nervous breakdown at the age of twenty years. The experience left him dissatisfied with Bentham’s philosophy of utility and social reform. As an alternative, Mill turned to Romanticism and poets like Coleridge and Johann Wolfgang Goethe (1749–1832).<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-012" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-012-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_14"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> What he ended up with, however, was not a rejection of utilitarianism but a synthesis of utility and human rights.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm238702944">Why rights? No doubt, Mill’s early life and formation had a great deal to do with his championing of individual freedom. He believed the effort to achieve utility was unjustified if it coerced people into doing things they did not want to do. Likewise, the appeal to science as the arbiter of truth would prove just as futile, he believed, if it did not temper facts with compassion. “Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing,” he wrote.<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-013" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-013-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_15"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Mill was interested in humanizing Bentham’s system by ensuring that everyone’s rights were protected, particularly the minority’s, not because rights were God given but because that was the most direct path to truth. Therefore, he introduced the <span data-type="term">harm principle</span>, which states that the “only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.” <a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-014" data-type="cite" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-014-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_16"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm231343312">To be sure, there are limitations to Mill’s version of utilitarianism, just as there were with the original. For one, there has never been a satisfactory definition of “harm,” and what one person finds harmful another may find beneficial. For Mill, harm was defined as the set back of one’s interests. Thus, harm was defined relative to an individual’s interests. But what role, if any, should society play in defining what is harmful or in determining who is harmed by someone’s actions? For instance, is society culpable for not intervening in cases of suicide, euthanasia, and other self-destructive activities such as drug addiction? These issues have become part of the public debate in recent years and most likely will continue to be as such actions are considered in a larger social context. We may also define intervention and coercion differently depending on where we fall on the political spectrum.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm234610096">Considering the social implications of an individual action highlights another limitation of utilitarianism, and one that perhaps makes more sense to us than it would to Bentham and Mill, namely, that it makes no provision for emotional or cognitive harm. If the harm is not measurable in physical terms, then it lacks significance. For example, if a reckless driver today irresponsibly exceeds the speed limit, crashes into a concrete abutment, and kills himself while totaling his vehicle (which he owns), utilitarianism would hold that in the absence of physical harm to others, no one suffers except the driver. We may not arrive at the same conclusion. Instead, we might hold that the driver’s survivors and friends, along with society as a whole, have suffered a loss. Arguably, all of us are diminished by the recklessness of his act.</p>

<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm237856336">Utilitarianism is used frequently when business leaders make critical decisions about things like expansion, store closings, hiring, and layoffs. They do not necessarily refer to a “utilitarian calculus,” but whenever they take stock of what is to be gained and what might be lost in any significant decision (e.g., in a cost-benefit analysis), they make a utilitarian determination. At the same time, one might argue that a simple cost-benefits analysis is not a utilitarian calculus unless it includes consideration of all stakeholders and a full accounting of externalities, worker preferences, potentially coercive actions related to customers, or community and environmental effects.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm223309104">As a practical way of measuring value, Bentham’s system also plays a role in risk management. The utility function, or the potential for benefit or loss, can be translated into decision-making, risk assessment, and strategic planning. Together with data analytics, market evaluations, and financial projections, the utility function can provide managers with a tool for measuring the viability of prospective projects. It may even give them an opportunity to explore objections about the mechanistic and impractical nature of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">utilitarianism</span>, especially from a customer perspective.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm231554368">Utilitarianism could motivate individuals within the organization to take initiative, become more responsible, and act in ways that enhance the organization’s reputation rather than tarnish it. Mill’s <em data-effect="italics">On Liberty</em> (<a href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_OSX_Ethics_02_04_Liberty" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), a short treatment of political freedoms in tension with the power of the state, underscored the importance of expression and free speech, which Mill saw not as one right among many but as the foundational right, reflective of human nature, from which all others rights derive their meaning. And therein lay the greatest utility for society and business. For Mill, the path to utility led through truth, and the main way of arriving at truth was through a deliberative process that encouraged individual expression and the clash of ideas.</p>

<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm231480768">As for Mill’s harm principle, the first question in trying to arrive at a business decision might be, does this action harm others? If the answer is yes, we must make a utilitarian calculation to decide whether there is still a greater good for the greatest number. Then we must ask, who are the others we must consider? All stakeholders? Only shareholders? What does harm entail, and who decides whether a proposed action might be harmful? This was the reason science and debate were so important to Mill, because the determination could not be left to public opinion or intuition. That was how tyranny started. By introducing deliberation, Mill was able to balance utility with freedom, which was a necessary condition for utility.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm232860112">Where Bentham looked to numerical formulas for determining value, relying on the objectivity of numbers, Mill sought value in reason and in the power of language to clarify where truth lies. The lesson for contemporary business, especially with the rise of big data, is that we need both numbers and reasoned principles. If we apply the Aristotelian and Confucian rule of the mean, we see that balance of responsibility and profitability makes the difference between sound business practices and poor ones.</p>

<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm234878352">Jeremy Bentham developed a quantifiable method for determining what was beneficial and what was detrimental. He called this method utilitarianism, because its basic unit, the “util,” acted like a monetary unit. Bentham’s protégé, John Stuart Mill, refined this system to include human rights. His “harm principle” is an outstanding element in his version of utilitarianism.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm223400624">Utilitarianism in business can lead to a bottom-line mentality in which decisions are based on achieving the greatest good for the organization as it pertains to the greatest number of stakeholders, including shareholders and all others affected by the actions of the organization The outcome is the determining factor, not the intent of the actors or whether people are treated humanely.</p>

Instead, he focused on motives and the willingness of individuals to act for the good of others, even though that action might result in personal loss. Doing something for the right reason was much more important to Kant than any particular outcome.</p>

<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm221303168">In 1781, at the age of fifty-six years, Kant published <em data-effect="italics">Critique of Pure Reason</em> (<em data-effect="italics">Kritik der Reinen Vernunft</em>) in Königsberg, Prussia (<a href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_OSX_Ethics_02_05_Critique" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).<a href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-001" data-type="cite" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-001-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_1"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Almost immediately, it transformed him from an obscure professor of metaphysics and logic into a preeminent figure in the world of philosophy. In the 800-page tome, Kant criticized the way rationalism (“pure reason”) had assumed the mantle of absolute truth, supplanting both religious faith and empirical science. Kant referred to the unquestioned acceptance of rationalism as <em data-effect="italics">dogmatism</em>. Whether Christian or revolutionary, dogmatic thinking was to be avoided because it obscured the truths of science and religion through flawed logic.</p>

<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm237599648">Kant credited the skepticism of empirical philosopher David <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hume</span> (1711–1776) with awakening him from “dogmatic slumber,” although he disagreed with Hume, who claimed that the mind did not exist at all but was the result of mental associations derived from sensory experience.<a href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-002" data-type="cite" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-002-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_3"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> For Kant, reality could be discerned not through reasoning or sensory experience alone but only by understanding the nature of the human mind. Kant argued that sensory experience did not create the mind but rather that the mind created experience through its internal structures. And within the mind’s complex structures there also existed an inherent and unconditional duty to act ethically, which Kant called the “categorical imperative,” first outlined in <em data-effect="italics">Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals</em> (1785).<a href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-003" data-type="cite" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-003-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_4"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm223045984">In its initial form, Kant’s described his concept of the <span data-type="term">categorical imperative</span> as follows: “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.”<a href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-004" data-type="cite" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-004-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_5"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Kant’s categorical (or unconditional) imperative has practical applications for the study of ethics. The categorical imperative contains two major suppositions: (1) We must act on the basis of goodwill rather than purely on self-interested motives that benefit ourselves at the expense of others; (2) we must never treat others as means toward ends benefitting ourselves without consideration of them also as ends in themselves. Kant held that observing the categorical imperative as we consider what actions to take would directly lead to ethical actions on our part.</p>

<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm235513536">How do you see the imperative working in your own life? Within your family? In your personal and professional relationships? Does Kant’s understanding of the relationship between art and beauty accord with your own?</p>
</div>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm237644992">In Kant’s view, rationalism and empiricism prevented people from perceiving the truth about their own nature. What was that truth? What was sufficient to constitute it? Kant identified an a priori world of knowledge and understanding in which truth lay in the structures and categories of the mind that were beyond perception and reason. This was a radical concept for the times.</p>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm232900736">In the end, Kant’s systematic analysis of knowing and understanding provided a much-needed counterweight to the logic of Enlightenment rationalism. The existence of the mental structures he proposed has even been confirmed today. For instance, the scientific consensus is that humans are born with cognitive structures designed specifically for language acquisition and development. Even more surprising, there may be similar cognitive structures for morality, conscience, and moral decision-making.<a href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-005" data-type="cite" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-005-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_6"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> So, it is quite possible that conscience, if not happiness, may have a genetic component after all, although Kant himself did not believe the categories of the understanding or the a priori structures of the mind were biological.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm235957664"><h3 data-type="title">Utilitarianism and Deontology</h3>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm235789040">From a Kantian perspective, it is clear that adherence to duty is what builds the framework for ethical acts. This is in direct contradiction of Bentham’s view of human nature as selfish and requiring an objective calculus for ethical action to result. Kant rejected the idea of such a calculus and believed, instead, that perceptions were organized into preexisting categories or structures of the mind. Compare his notion of an ordered and purposeful universe of laws with the similar <em data-effect="italics">logos</em>, or logic, of the ancient Greeks. One of those laws included implementation of the categorical imperative to act ethically, in accordance with our conscience. However, even though that imperative ought to be followed without exception, not everyone does so. In Kant’s moral teachings, individuals still had free will to accept or reject it.</p>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm235434704">There is a definite contrast between utilitarianism, even Mill’s version, and Kant’s system of ethics, known as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">deontology</span>, in which duty, obligation, and good will are of the highest importance. (The word is derived from the Greek <em data-effect="italics">deon</em>, meaning duty, and <em data-effect="italics">logos</em> again, here meaning organization for the purpose of study.<a href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-006" data-type="cite" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-006-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_7"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a>) An ethical decision requires us to observe only the rights and duties we owe to others, and, in the context of business, act on the basis of a primary motive to do what is right by all stakeholders. Kant was not concerned with utility or outcome—his was not a system directed toward results. The question for him was not how to attain happiness but how to become worthy of it.</p>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm223185232">Rather like Aristotle and Confucius, Kant taught that the transcendent aspects of human nature, if followed, would lead us inevitably to treat people as ends rather than means. To be moral meant to renounce uninformed dogmatism and rationalism, abide by the categorical imperative, and embrace freedom, moral sense, and even divinity. This was not a lofty or unattainable goal in Kant’s mind, because these virtues constituted part of the systematic structuring of the human mind. It could be accomplished by living truthfully or, as we say today, authentically. Such a feat transcended the logic of both rationalism and empiricism.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm237397664" class="what-would"><div data-type="title" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_8"><em data-effect="italics">Les Misérables</em></div>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm235126400">You may have seen the very popular Broadway show or movie <em data-effect="italics">Les Misérables</em>, based on Victor Hugo’s epic nineteenth-century French novel of the same name. The main character, Jean Valjean, steals a loaf of bread to feed his sister’s starving family and is arrested and sent to prison. If we apply conventional reasoning and principles of law to his crime, Valjean genuinely is guilty as charged and we do not need to consider any extenuating circumstances. However, in a Kantian ethical framework, we would take into account Valjean’s motives as well as his duty to treat his sister’s family as ends in themselves who deserve to live. Valjean’s fate demonstrates what might occur when there is a gap between the legal and the moral. Clearly, Valjean broke the law by stealing the bread. However, he acted morally by correcting a wrong and possibly saving human lives. According to Kantian ethics, Valjean may have been ethical in stealing bread for his family, particularly because the action was grounded in good will and provided benefit to others more than to himself.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm237910144"><h3 data-type="title">Kantian Business Ethics</h3>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm231477600">Unlike utilitarianism, which forms the philosophical foundation for most cost-benefit analysis in business, Kantian ethics is not so easily applied. On one hand, it offers a unique opportunity for the development of individual morality through the categorical imperative to act ethically, which emphasizes humanity and autonomy.<a href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-007" data-type="cite" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-007-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_9"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> This imperative addresses one major side of business ethics: the personal. Character and moral formation are crucial to creating an ethical culture. Indeed, business ethics is littered with cases of companies that have suffered damaging crises due to their leaders’ lack of commitment to act on the basis of a good will and with regard for what benefits others. Recent examples include Uber, where a toxic work environment was allowed to prevail, and Volkswagen, which knowingly misrepresented the emissions level of its cars.<a href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-008" data-type="cite" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-008-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_10"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Such examples exist in government as well, as the recent Theranos and “Fat Leonard” scandals confirm.<a href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-009" data-type="cite" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-009-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_11"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> The latter consisted of graft and corruption in the U.S. Navy’s Pacific fleet and has been a continual source of embarrassment for an institution that prides itself on the honorable conduct of its officers. One person can make a difference, either positively or negatively.</p>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm238934288">On the other hand, Kant’s categorical imperative is just that: categorical or unconditional. It calls for morally upright behavior regardless of external circumstance or the historical context of a proposed act or decision. Kant affirmed that “the moral law is an imperative, which commands categorically, because the law is unconditioned.”<a href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-010" data-type="cite" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-010-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_12"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Unconditional ethics could be a challenge for a global organization dealing with suppliers, customers, and competitors in sometimes vastly different cultures. It raises a larger philosophical issue: namely, was Kant correct in believing that morality and mental categories are independent of experience? Or can they be culturally conditioned, and, if so, does that make them relative rather than absolute, as Kant believed them to be?</p>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm237501168">This question whether ethics is universal is distinctly Kantian, because Kant believed that not only must a moral agent act with others’ interests in mind and have the right intentions, but also that the action be universally applicable. Think of how Kantian ethics might be applied not just on an individual level but throughout an organization, and then society. Kant would judge a corporate act to be ethical if it benefitted others at the same time it benefitted company leadership and stockholders, and if it did not place their interests above those of other stakeholders. If loyalty to a coworker conflicted with loyalty to a supervisor or the organization, for instance, then acts resulting from such loyalty might not meet the conditions of deontology. Either the supervisor or the company would be treated as a means rather than an end. Although the qualitative or humanizing element of Kantian ethics has broad appeal, it runs into limitations in an actual business setting. Whether the limitations have good or bad effects depends on the organization’s culture and leadership. In general, however, most companies do not adhere to strict Kantian theories, because they look to the outcome of their decisions rather than focusing on motives or intentions.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm231386928" class="real-world"><div data-type="title" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_13">Samsung</div>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm236725792">In the fall of 2016, Samsung Electronics experienced a massive public relations disaster when its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones started exploding due to faulty batteries and casings. Initially, the company denied there were any technical problems. Then, when it became obvious the exploding phones posed a safety and health threat (they were banned from airplanes), Samsung accused its suppliers of creating the problem. In reality, the rush to beat Apple’s iPhone 7 release date was the most likely reason corners were cut in production. Samsung finally owned up to the problem, recalled more than two million phones worldwide, and replaced them with new, improved Galaxy Note 7s.</p>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm235396784">The company’s response and its replacement of the phones went a long way toward defusing the disaster and even boosting the company’s share price. Whether management knew it, its response was Kantian. Samsung focused on the end (i.e., customer safety and satisfaction) with the motive of doing the ethically responsible thing. Although some might argue the company could have done far more and much more quickly, perhaps it still acted in accordance with the categorical imperative. What do you think?</p>

<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm232058880">Rejecting dogmatic thinking of all kinds, Kant believed people were not the sum total of reactions to stimuli but complex beings with innate structures of understanding and inborn moral sensitivity. In his view, everyone had a duty to obey a categorical imperative to do the just and moral thing, regardless of the consequences. The outcome of an act was not as important as the intent of the actor and whether the act treated others as ends or means. Here, Kant reflected Aristotelian virtue ethics in seeing people as ends in themselves and not as “living tools” or human resources.</p>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm231323552">This view does not typically govern most management decisions in business; arguably, utilitarianism is the efficient, go-to theory on which corporate leaders often rely. Yet a Kantian understanding of business ethics remains viable even today and sometimes displays itself in the most compassionate and humane actions that evolving commercial organizations take.</p>

It ends with an American political philosopher for whom the equal distribution of resources was a primary concern. John <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Rawls</span> (1921–2002) wanted to change the debate that had prevailed throughout the 1960s and 1970s in the West about how to maximize wealth for everyone. He sought not to maximize wealth, which was a utilitarian goal, but to establish justice as the criterion by which goods and services were distributed among the populace. Justice, for Rawls, had to do with fairness—in fact, he frequently used the expression <span data-type="term">justice as fairness</span>—and his concept of fairness was a political one that relied on the state to take care of the most disadvantaged. In his <span data-type="term">justice theory</span>, offered as an alternative to the dominant utilitarianism of the times, the idea of fairness applied beyond the individual to include the community as well as analysis of social injustice with remedies to correct it.</p>

<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm223400592">Rawls developed a theory of justice based on the Enlightenment ideas of thinkers like John Locke (1632–1704) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), who advocated <span data-type="term">social contract theory</span>. Social contract theory held that the natural state of human beings was freedom, but that human beings will rationally submit to some restrictions on their freedom to secure their mutual safety and benefit, not subjugation to a monarch, no matter how benign or well intentioned. This idea parallels that of Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), who interpreted human nature to be selfish and brutish to the degree that, absent the strong hand of a ruler, chaos would result. So people willingly consent to transfer their autonomy to the control of a sovereign so their very lives and property will be secured. Rousseau rejected that view, as did Rawls, who expanded social contract theory to include justice as fairness. In <em data-effect="italics">A Theory of Justice</em> (1971), Rawls introduced a universal system of fairness and a set of procedures for achieving it. He advocated a practical, empirically verifiable system of governance that would be political, social, and economic in its effects.</p>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm237258800">Rawls’s justice theory contains three principles and five procedural steps for achieving fairness. The principles are (1) an “original position,” (2) a “veil of ignorance,” and (3) unanimity of acceptance of the original position.<a href="#auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-001" data-type="cite" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-001-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_1"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> By <span data-type="term">original position</span>, Rawls meant something akin to Hobbes’ understanding of the state of nature, a hypothetical situation in which rational people can arrive at a contractual agreement about how resources are to be distributed in accordance with the principles of justice as fairness. This agreement was intended to reflect not present reality but a desired state of affairs among people in the community. The <span data-type="term">veil of ignorance</span> (<a href="#auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_OSX_Ethics_02_06_Veil" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) is a condition in which people arrive at the original position imagining they have no identity regarding age, sex, ethnicity, education, income, physical attractiveness, or other characteristics. In this way, they reduce their bias and self-interest. Last, <span data-type="term">unanimity of acceptance</span> is the requirement that all agree to the contract before it goes into effect. Rawls hoped this justice theory would provide a minimum guarantee of rights and liberties for everyone, because no one would know, until the veil was lifted, whether they were male, female, rich, poor, tall, short, intelligent, a minority, Roman Catholic, disabled, a veteran, and so on.</p>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm232598592">The five procedural steps, or “conjectures,” are (1) entering into the contract, (2) agreeing unanimously to the contract, (3) including basic conditions in the contract such as freedom of speech, (4) maximizing the welfare of the most disadvantaged persons, and (5) ensuring the stability of the contract.<a href="#auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-002" data-type="cite" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-002-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_2"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> These steps create a system of justice that Rawls believed gave fairness its proper place above utility and the bottom line. The steps also supported his belief in people’s instinctual drive for fairness and equitable treatment. Perhaps this is best seen in an educational setting, for example, the university. By matriculating, students enter into a contract that includes basic freedoms such as assembly and speech. Students at a disadvantage (e.g., those burdened with loans, jobs, or other financial constraints) are accommodated as well as possible. The contract between the university and students has proven to be stable over time, from generation to generation. This same procedure applies on a micro level to the experience in the classroom between an individual teacher and students. Over the past several decades—for better or worse—the course syllabus has assumed the role of a written contract expressing this relationship.</p>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm229300064">Rawls gave an example of what he called “pure procedural justice” in which a cake is shared among several people.<a href="#auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-003" data-type="cite" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-003-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_3"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> By what agreement shall the cake be divided? Rawls determined that the best way to divide the cake is to have the person slicing the cake take the last piece. This will ensure that everyone gets an equal amount. What is important is an independent standard to determine what is just and a procedure for implementing it.<a href="#auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-004" data-type="cite" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-004-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_4"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm223389552">Part of Rawls’s critique of utilitarianism is that its utility calculus can lead to tyranny. If we define pleasure as that which is popular, the minority can suffer in terrible ways and the majority become mere numbers. This became clear in Mills’s attempt to humanize Bentham’s calculus. But Mills’s harm principle had just as bad an effect, for the opposite reason. It did not require anyone to give up anything if it had to be done through coercion or force. To extend Rawls’s cake example, if one person owned a bakery and another were starving, like Jean Valjean’s sister in <em data-effect="italics">Les Misérables</em>, utilitarianism would force the baker to give up what he had to satisfy the starving person without taking into account whether the baker had greater debts, a sick spouse requiring medical treatment, or a child with educational loans; in other words, the <em data-effect="italics">context</em> of the situation matters, as opposed to just the consequences. However, Mill’s utilitarianism, adhering to the harm principle, would leave the starving person to his or her own devices. At least he or she would have one slice of cake. This was the problem of distribution and redistribution that Rawls hoped to solve, not by calculating pleasure and pain, profit and loss, but by applying fairness as a normative value that would benefit individuals and society.<a href="#auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-005" data-type="cite" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-005-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_5"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm234884784">The problem with this approach is that justice theory is a radical, egalitarian form of liberalism in which redistribution of material goods and services occurs without regard for historical context or the presumption many share that it inherently is wrong to take the property legally acquired by one and distribute it to another. Rawls has been criticized for promoting the same kind of coercion that can exist in utilitarianism but on the basis of justice rather than pleasure. Justice on a societal level would guarantee housing, education, medical treatment, food, and the basic necessities of life for everyone. Yet, as recent political campaigns have shown, the question of who will pay for these guaranteed goods and services through taxes is a contentious one. These are not merely fiscal and political issues; they are philosophical ones requiring us to answer questions of logic and, especially in the case of justice theory, fairness. And, naturally, we must ask, what is fair?</p>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm232209632">Rawls’s principles and steps assume that the way in which the redistribution of goods and services occurs would be agreed upon by people in the community to avoid any fairness issues. But questions remain. For one, Rawls’s justice, like the iconic depiction, is blind and cannot see the circumstances in which goods and services are distributed. Second, we may question whether a notion of fairness is really innate. Third, despite the claim that justice theory is not consequentialist (meaning outcomes are not the only thing that matters), there is a coercive aspect to Rawls’s justice once the contract is in force, replacing utility with mandated fairness. Fourth, is this the kind of system in which people thrive and prosper, or, by focusing on the worst off, are initiative, innovation, and creativity dampened on the part of everyone else? Perhaps the most compelling critic of Rawls in this regard was his colleague at Harvard University, Robert Nozick (1938–2002), who wrote <em data-effect="italics">A Theory of Entitlement</em> (1974) as a direct rebuttal of Rawlsian justice theory.<a href="#auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-006" data-type="cite" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-006-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_6"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Nozick argued that the power of the state may never ethically be used to deprive someone of property he or she has legally obtained or inherited in order to distribute it to others who are in need of it.</p>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm232535312">Still, one of the advantages of justice theory over the other ethical systems presented in this chapter is its emphasis on method as opposed to content. The system runs on a methodology or process for arriving at truth through the underlying value of fairness. Again, in this sense it is similar to utilitarianism, but, by requiring unanimity, it avoids the extremes of Bentham’s and Mill’s versions. As a method in ethics, it can be applied in a variety of ways and in multiple disciplines, because it can be adapted to just about any value-laden content. Of course, this raises the question of content versus method in ethics, especially because ethics has been defined as a set of cultural norms based on agreed-upon values. Method may be most effective in determining what those underlying values are, rather than how they are implemented.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm223267056"><h3 data-type="title">Justice in Business</h3>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm227847040">Although no ethical framework is perfect or fits a particular era completely, Rawls’s justice theory has distinct advantages when applied to business in the twenty-first century. First, as businesses become interdependent and globalized, they must pay more attention to quality control, human resources, and leadership in diverse settings. What will give greater legitimacy to an organization in these areas than fairness? Fairness is a value that is cross-cultural, embraced by different social groups, and understood by nearly everyone. However, what is considered fair depends on a variety of factors, including underlying values and individual characteristics like personality. For instance, not everyone agrees on whether or how diversity ought to be achieved. Neither is there consensus about affirmative action or the redistribution of resources or income. What is fair to some may be supremely unfair to others. This presents an opportunity for engaged debate and participation among the members of Rawls’s community.</p>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm237111296">Second, as we saw earlier, justice theory provides a method for attaining fairness, which could make it a practical and valuable part of training at all levels of a company. The fact that its content—justice and fairness—is more accessible to contemporary people than Confucian virtue ethics and more flexible than Kant’s categorical imperative makes it an effective way of dealing with stakeholders and organizational culture.</p>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm237669440">Justice theory may also provide a seamless way of engaging in corporate social responsibility outwardly and employee development inwardly. Fairness as a corporate doctrine can be applied to all stakeholders and define a culture of trust and openness, with all the corresponding benefits, in marketing, advertising, board development, client relations, and so on. It is also an effective way of integrating business ethics into the organization so ethics is no longer seen as the responsibility solely of the compliance department or legal team. Site leaders and middle managers understand fairness; employees probably even more so, because they are more directly affected by the lack of it. Fairness, then, is as much part of the job as it is an ongoing process of an ethics system. It no doubt makes for a happier and more productive workforce. An organization dedicated to it can also play a greater role in civic life and the political process, which, in turn, helps everyone.</p>

In this sense, it is like life itself. After all, you have no idea what your future will be like. You could end up rich, poor, married, single, living in Manhattan or Peru. You might be a surgeon or fishing for sturgeon. Yet, there is one community you will most likely be a part of at some point: the aged. Given that you know this but are not sure of the details, which conditions would you agree to <em data-effect="italics">now</em> so that senior citizens are provided for?

<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm234828112">Rawls developed a theory of justice based on social contract theory, holding that the natural state of human beings is freedom, not subjugation to a monarch, no matter how benign or well intentioned. Rawls’s theory views human beings as inherently good and, echoing Kant, inclined toward moral rectitude and action. In his theory, Rawls included the “veil of ignorance,” which ensures objectivity in our choices and the avoidance of bias. Criticism of Rawls’s theory focuses primarily on the issue of distribution, because decisions made in ignorance can neither reward innovation and enterprise nor encourage risk.</p>

Aristotle spent about twenty years at Plato’s Academy in Athens, first as a student and then as an associate. Later he tutored the young Alexander of Macedonia, who would become Alexander the Great.<a href="#auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm164956432" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm164956432">Aristotle’s family originated from a region in northern Greece that was adjacent to classical Macedonia, and his father, Nicomachus, had similarly tutored Alexander’s father, Philip II of Macedonia.</aside>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm164779248">Aristotle eventually returned to Athens where he opened his own school, the Lyceum, and where he studied and taught extensively in philosophy, government, and the natural and social sciences. He, along with most of the classical Greek thinkers, believed that all academic disciplines were linked. They were far less inclined than we are to rigidly separate academic subjects.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm192341392">Aristotle’s principle work on ethics, <em data-effect="italics">The Nicomachean Ethics</em>, was dedicated either to his father or son, both of whom were named Nicomachus, a popular name within his family. In <em data-effect="italics">Ethics</em>, where Aristotle laid out the essence of virtue theory, he stated that if we truly desire people to be ethical, then we must have them practice ethics from an early age. Just as Plato claimed that unethical individuals are simply uneducated in ethics, so Aristotle held that constant practice is the best means by which to create ethical humans. He contended that men—for Aristotle, unlike Plato, education was restricted to males—who are taught to be ethical in minor matters as boys will automatically act ethically in all matters as they mature. Of course, a legitimate question regarding both philosophers is whether we believe they are correct on these points.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm193237280">In <em data-effect="italics">Ethics</em>, Aristotle introduced the concept of what is usually referred to as the golden mean of moderation. He believed that every virtue resides somewhere between the vices of defect and excess. That is, one can display either too little or too much of a good thing, or a virtue. The trick, as for Goldilocks, is to have just the right amount of it. Adding to the complexity of this, however, is the fact that striking the right balance between too much and too little does not necessarily put one midway between the two. The mean of moderation is more of a sliding value, fluctuating between defect and excess, but not automatically splitting the difference between them. Depending on the virtue in question, the mean may lie closer to a deficit or to a surplus. For example, take the virtue of courage (<a href="#auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_OSX_Ethics_01_AA_Courage" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). For Aristotle, the mean laid closer to foolhardiness or brashness. It’s not that foolhardiness is less a vice than cowardice; it’s just that courage verges closer to the one than to the other.</p>

<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm192932864">Aristotle also speaks of <em data-effect="italics">eudaemonia</em>, a perfect balance of happiness and goodness interpreted classically. Humans experience <em data-effect="italics">eudaemonia</em> both in themselves and in the world when they act virtuously and live a life of rational thought and contemplation. As Aristotle argued, rational thought is the activity of the divine, so it is appropriate for men to emulate this practice, as well.</p>

<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm167644320">Jeremy <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bentham</span>, an attorney, became what we would today call a consultant to the British Parliament in the late-eighteenth century. He was given the task of devising a method by which members could evaluate the worth of proposed legislation. He took a Latin term—<em data-effect="italics">util</em>, or utility, usefulness, or happiness—and calculated the number of utils in proposed bills. Essentially this quantified the scoring of upcoming legislation—those pieces with the greatest number of utils were given a higher ranking than those with the least.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm166389424">Utilitarianism as an ethical system today, though it has application to many areas beyond that simply of lawmaking, holds to this same principle. When making moral decisions, we are advised to select that action which produces the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people. If the balance of good or happiness or usefulness outweighs that of evil, harm, or unhappiness, then the choice is a moral one. On the other hand, if the balance of evil outweighs that of good, then the choice is immoral. Due to this emphasis on the outcome of ethical decisions, utilitarianism is classified as a consequentialist theory.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm183076400">Bentham lays much of his theory out in <em data-effect="italics">An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation</em> (1789). There, he proposes the hedonic calculus—from the Greek <em data-effect="italics">hedone</em>, or pleasure—as a mechanism by which one can determine the amount of pleasure versus pain in moral choices.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm164481360">Bentham found a ready supporter and lieutenant in James Mill (1773–1836), a Scottish lawyer who came to assist Bentham in championing utilitarianism as a political philosophy. And when Mill’s son, John Stuart, was born, Bentham, having no children of his own, became his godfather. Together, Bentham and the elder Mill established a curriculum through which the younger Mill was schooled at home, an arrangement that was not uncommon in the early nineteenth century. John Stuart was evidently a prodigy and at an early age was taking on Greek, Latin, economic theory, and higher mathematics.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm192245456">An odd twist accompanies the arrangements that Bentham made for his body after his death. Because donated cadavers were rare in teaching hospitals and this had led to a rash of grave-robbing, he stipulated that his body be dissected by surgeons for the education of their students, while in the presence of his friends. He further requested that, afterward, his body be re-stitched together, dressed in his own clothes, and perpetually displayed at what was then a new school that he had endowed, University College in London. To this day, Bentham’s corpse, with a wax head to replace the original, mummified one, is posed in a glass case at meetings of the trustees of University College, all by provision of his will.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm187981152">John Stuart <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Mill</span>, as he reached adulthood, became a leader of the second generation of utilitarians. He broke with his mentor, though, in one significant way: by distinguishing between different levels of pleasure—higher and lower ones—and offering a means by which to determine where any given pleasure falls. While Bentham insisted that ranking pleasures were subjective and that no one could truly say that some pleasures were objectively more worthy than others, the younger Mill claimed that we could indeed specifically determine which pleasures were the higher ones by polling educated people. Those pleasures which were ranked highest by this select cohort were indeed the greatest ones, and those which were ranked least were the inferior ones.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm171922304">Mill also refined the political applications of utilitarianism and, in so doing, laid the foundation for the political movement of libertarianism. Though he himself never used this term and probably would take issue with being labeled a libertarian were he alive today, he did introduce many of the principles that are esteemed by libertarians. In his most important work on political freedoms, <em data-effect="italics">On Liberty</em> (1859), he introduced the no-harm rule. By this, Mill proposed that no individual be deprived of his or her right to act in any fashion, even a self-destructive one, provided that his or her action does not impinge <em data-effect="italics">physically</em> on others.<a href="#auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm165037904" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm165037904">A limitation within Mill’s no-harm principle was its focus solely on physical harm without acknowledgement of the reality of psychological damage. He made no allowance for what the law today denotes as pain and suffering. In his defense, this concept is a twentieth-century one and has little credibility among Mill’s contemporaries.</aside>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm162852240">For example, according to Mill, we may try to persuade an alcoholic to give up drinking. We may marshal our best arguments in an attempt to convince him or her that this is wrong and harmful—“remonstrate” is the verb that he employed. Still, if the alcoholic persists in drinking excessively despite our best efforts to encourage him or her otherwise, then no power of the state ought to be brought to bear to prevent him or her from drinking, unless and until the drinking causes physical harm to others. One can see the application of this to, say, motorcycle-helmet laws today. Mill would hold that even though the injury-preventing capacity of helmets clearly can be demonstrated, bikers still ought to be permitted to refrain from wearing them if they so choose.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm200459312">The significance of utilitarianism in our era lies in the fact that many of us implement utilitarian thought processes when we have to make many ethical choices, even if we don’t necessarily consider ourselves to be utilitarians. In addition, utilitarianism continues to influence new generations of philosophers and ethical thinkers, such as the Australian Peter Singer, an inspiration for the contemporary animal rights movement who is currently on the faculty at Princeton University.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm191130352">A telling critique of utilitarianism, however, is the objection that it assays no good or evil in acts themselves, but only in the good or evil that these acts produce. If a proposed municipal, state, or federal law could be demonstrated to serve the defined interests of a majority at the expense of the interests only of a minority, then utilitarianism would suggest that such a law is good and moral. Little recognition appears within utilitarianism of the possibility of tyranny of the majority. Many critics of utilitarianism have scored this weakness of the ethical system. A persuasive instance of this is the short story “Those Who Walk Away from Omelas” by the American writer Ursula K. Le Guin (1929–2018).</p>

<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm192036256"><strong data-effect="bold">Immanuel Kant, 1724–1804</strong></p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm166374672">The sage of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad in Russia), <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Kant</span> taught philosophy at the University of Königsberg for several years. In fact, throughout a very long lifetime, especially by the standards of the eighteenth century, he never traveled far from the city where he had been born.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm190692672">Kant’s parents were members of a strict sect of Lutheranism called pietism, and he remained a practicing Christian throughout his life. Though he only occasionally noted religion in his writing, his advocacy of deontology cannot be understood apart from an appreciation of his religious faith. Religion and ethics went hand in hand for Kant, and God always remained the ground or matrix upon which his concept of morality was raised.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm207745056">Though he never married, Kant was by contemporary accounts no dour loner. He apparently was highly popular among his colleagues and students and often spent evenings eating and drinking in their company. He frequently hosted gatherings at his own lodging and served as a faculty master at the university. He was also a creature of habit, taking such regular walks through the neighborhood surrounding campus that residents could tell the time of day by the moment when he would pass their doorway or window.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm151644608">The term deontology stems from the Greek <em data-effect="italics">deon</em>—duty, obligation, or command. As an ethical system, it is the radical opposite of utilitarianism in that it holds that the consequences of a moral decision are of no matter whatsoever. What <em data-effect="italics">is</em> important are the motives as to why one has acted in the way that one has. So an action may have beneficial results, but still be unethical <em data-effect="italics">if</em> it has been performed for the wrong reasons. Similarly, an action may have catastrophic consequences, but still be deemed moral if it has been done on the basis of the right will.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm210626032">Not only is deontology non-consequentialist, it is also non-situationalist. That is, an act is either right or wrong always and everywhere. The context surrounding it is unimportant. The best example of this is Kant’s famous allusion to an axe-murderer who, in seeking his victim, must always be told the truth as to his would-be victim’s whereabouts. By Kant’s reasoning, one cannot lie even in this dire circumstance in order to save the life of an innocent person. Kant was not diminishing the significance of human life in holding that the truth must always be told. Instead, he was insisting that truth-telling is one of the inviolable principles that frames our lives. To lie—even in defense of life—is to cheapen and weaken an essential pillar that sustains us. Kant knew that this example would draw critics, but he deliberately chose it anyway in order to demonstrate his conviction about the rightness of certain acts.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm217425360">Perhaps the most well-known element of Kant’s ethics is his explanation of the categorical imperative, laid out in his <em data-effect="italics">Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Ethics</em>, 1785. This intimidating phrase is just a fancy way of saying that some actions must always be taken and certain standards always upheld, such as truth-telling. The categorical imperative has two expressions, each of which Kant regarded as stating the same thing. In its first expression, the categorical imperative holds that a moral agent (i.e., a human being imbued with reason and a God-given soul) is free to act only in ways that he or she would permit any other moral agent to act. That is, none of us is able to claim that we are special and so entitled to privileges to which others are not also entitled. And in its second expression, the categorical imperative stipulates that we must treat others as ends in themselves and not just as means to our own ends. So we can never simply use people as stepping stones to our own goals and objectives unless we are also willing to be so treated by them.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm192903904">Despite the enduring popularity of utilitarianism as an ethical system, deontology is probably even more pronounced within our moral sensitivity. Perhaps the best indicator of this is that most of us believe that a person’s motives for acting ought to be taken into account when judging whether those actions are ethical or unethical. To witness a famous literary example of this, Victor Hugo made clear in <em data-effect="italics">Les Misérables</em> that his protagonist, Jean Valjean, became a hunted man simply because he stole bread to feed his starving family. By Hugo’s standards—and our own—Valjean truly committed no crime, and the tragedy of his life is that he must spend a significant part of it on the run from the dogged Inspector Javert.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm194791824">Deontology, like all ethical systems, has its critics, and they zero in on its inflexibility regarding acts which may never be permitted, such as telling a lie, even if it is to save a life. Still, the system continues to inspire a devoted following of philosophers to this day. In the twentieth century, this was notably represented by the British ethicist W. D. Ross (1877–1971) and the American political philosopher John Rawls (1921–2002). Those who embrace deontology are typically attracted to its deep-seated sense of honor and commitment to objective values in addition to its insistence that all humans be treated with dignity and respect.</p>

<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm179299552"><strong data-effect="bold">John Rawls, 1921–2002</strong></p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm196076496">Though <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Rawls</span> considered himself to be a utilitarian, he also acknowledged that his moral philosophy owed much to the social contract tradition represented over the past few centuries by John Locke and David Hume, among others. To complicate Rawls’ philosophy even further, there was a bit of deontology exhibited in it, too, through Rawls’ sentiment was that political freedoms and material possessions be distributed as fully and widely as possible precisely because it is the right thing to do.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm191469024">Rawls is a uniquely American political philosopher, and this can be seen from his emphasis on political liberty. But this statement also speaks to his commitment to the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill, the second-generation leader of that movement. Hence Rawls’s assertion that he actually was a utilitarian at heart.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm195220592">Whatever the influences on his thought, Rawls was the most significant political philosopher ever to emerge from the United States, and probably one of the most influential ethicists in the West over the past several centuries. He labeled his ethics to be “justice as fairness,” and he developed it over nearly a lifetime. It was laid out formally in 1971 with the publication of his <em data-effect="italics">A Theory of Justice</em>, a treatise of more than 550 pages. Still, preliminary drafts of what became this book were circulating within philosophical circles beginning in the late 1950s.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm200436688">To be fair, Rawls insisted, human justice must be centered on a firm foundation comprising a first and second principle. The first principle declared that “each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others.” These liberties included traditional ones such as freedom of thought and speech, the vote, a fair trial when accused of a crime, and the ownership of some personal property not subject to the state’s seizure. Very few commentators have criticized this principle.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm184122432">It is the second principle, however, which has incurred the loudest objections. It consisted of two sub-points: first, socio-economic inequality is permissible only to the degree that it brings the greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society. (Rawls labeled this the <em data-effect="italics">difference principle</em>.) And, second, authority and offices are to be available to everyone competent to hold them. (Rawls called this <em data-effect="italics">fair equality of opportunity</em>.) Additionally, the training to ensure that all may merit these offices absolutely must be available to all.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm203278640">What Rawls actually advocated was an at-least minimal distribution of material goods and services to everyone, regardless of what inheritance he or she might come by or what work he or she might engage in. And this tenet has incurred a firestorm of controversy. Many have embraced what they term Rawls’ egalitarian perspective on the ownership of property. Yet others have argued that he ignored the unlimited right to ownership of personal property specifically predicated on hard work and/or bequests from family. On the other hand, pure Marxists have dismissed this principle as not going far enough to ensure that sizable estates, as well as the means of production, be extracted from the clutches of plutocrats.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm210460256">How might society move toward justice as fairness? Rawls proposed a thought exercise: If we all could imagine ourselves, before birth, to be in what he calls the Original Position, knowing only that we would be born but without knowledge of what sex, race, wealth, ethnicity, intelligence, health, or family structures we would be assigned, then we necessarily would ensure that these two principles would be observed. We would do so because we would have absolutely no way of predicting the real-life circumstances which we would inherit post-birth and wouldn’t want to risk being born into an impoverished or tyrannical environment.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm191941872">The reason why we would be blind as to the world that each of us would inhabit would be because we would be cloaked by a “veil of ignorance” that would screen us from pre-knowledge of our circumstances once we were born—in other words, viewed from the original position, we wouldn’t take the chance of suffering from political oppression or material poverty. Self-interest, then, would motivate us to insist that these minimum levels of political and material largesse would be the birthright of all.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm198027680">Of course, we can’t return to our pre-birth stage and so negotiate this sort of arrangement beforehand. Hence, the only way of creating this sort of world now would be to imagine that we were in the original position and deliberately build such a fair environment for all.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm167517280">Given human nature and its inherent selfishness, is it reasonable to expect human beings to make a concerted effort to create the structures needed for justice as fairness? Perhaps not, but realize that Rawls was only following in the footsteps of Plato in his proposal to craft a perfect <em data-effect="italics">polis</em>, or city-state, in <em data-effect="italics">The Republic</em>. Therein Plato took all of the beauty and wisdom of the Athens of his day and imagined it without any of its limitations. Plato knew that this was an ideal, but he also realized that even an attempt to build such a city-state would produce what he regarded as much incalculable good.</p>
