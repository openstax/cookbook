We have endeavored to make the workings of American Government interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the conceptual coverage and rigor inherent in the subject at the college level. With this objective in mind, the content of this textbook has been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from the fundamental principles of institutional design at the founding, to avenues of political participation, to thorough coverage of the political structures that constitute American government. The book builds upon what students have already learned and emphasizes connections between topics as well as between theory and applications. The goal of each section is to enable students not just to recognize concepts, but to work with them in ways that will be useful in later courses, future careers, and as engaged citizens. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from American government instructors dedicated to the project.</p><p id="auto_c4926429-a48a-4355-8292-dea184b74340_fs-id1172504673723"><strong data-effect="bold">Unit I: Students and the System</strong></p>

OpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. After publishing the first edition of American Government soon after the 2016 election, adopter feedback indicated that the 2018 midterm elections were a logical timeline for an update. Faculty indicated that waiting until this point would allow more time for analysis of the 2016 election and its outcomes, and that the results of the 2018 elections would be significant enough to drive discussion in courses. Nearly all of the revisions are focused on careful and balanced treatment of the events and developments of the past two years, and the manner in which those developments connect to core concepts.

<p id="auto_4a3754eb-83a0-4a71-aa2c-aa8dfcd00086_fs-id1171472269687">Since its founding, the United States has relied on citizen participation to govern at the local, state, and national levels. This civic engagement ensures that representative democracy will continue to flourish and that people will continue to influence government. The right of citizens to participate in government is an important feature of democracy, and over the centuries many have fought to acquire and defend this right. During the American Revolution (1775–1783), British colonists fought for the right to govern themselves. In the early nineteenth century, agitated citizens called for the removal of property requirements for voting so poor White men could participate in government just as wealthy men could. Throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, women, African Americans, Native Americans, and many other groups fought for the right to vote and hold office. </p><p id="auto_4a3754eb-83a0-4a71-aa2c-aa8dfcd00086_fs-id1171472143696">The poster shown above (<a href="#auto_4a3754eb-83a0-4a71-aa2c-aa8dfcd00086_OSC_AmGov_01_00_Voting" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), created during World War II, depicts voting as an important part of the fight to keep the United States free. The purpose of voting and other forms of political engagement is to ensure that government serves the people, and not the other way around. But what does government do to serve the people? What different forms of government exist? How do they differ? How can citizens best engage with and participate in the crucial process of governing the nation? This chapter seeks to answer these questions.</p>

<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171472210106">Government affects all aspects of people’s lives. What we eat, where we go to school, what kind of education we receive, how our tax money is spent, and what we do in our free time are all affected by government. Americans are often unaware of the pervasiveness of government in their everyday lives, and many are unsure precisely what it does. Here we will look at what government is, what it does, and how the government of the United States differs from other kinds of governments.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171472162549"><h3 data-type="title">DEFINING GOVERNMENT</h3>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171472241929">The term <span data-type="term">government</span> describes the means by which a society organizes itself and allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs. Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity for the nation, secure national borders, and the safety and well-being of citizens. Governments also provide benefits for their citizens. The type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system, but governments commonly provide such things as education, health care, and an infrastructure for transportation. The term <span data-type="term">politics</span> refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals, especially those related to the division of resources within a nation.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171474345553">Sometimes governmental systems are confused with economic systems. This is because certain types of political thought or governmental organization are closely related to or develop with certain types of economic systems. For example, the economic system of capitalism in Western Europe and North America developed at roughly the same time as ideas about democratic republics, self-government, and natural rights. At this time, the idea of liberty became an important concept. According to John <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Locke</span>, an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century, all people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed. In the eighteenth century, in Great Britain’s North American colonies, and later in France, this developed into the idea that people should govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king; only those representatives chosen by the people had the right to make laws to govern them.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171474478721">Similarly, Adam <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Smith</span>, a Scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after Locke’s death, believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished. Instead of being controlled by government, business, and industry, Smith argued, people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work. Competition would ensure that prices remained low and faulty goods disappeared from the market. In this way, businesses would reap profits, consumers would have their needs satisfied, and society as a whole would prosper. Smith discussed these ideas, which formed the basis for industrial capitalism, in his book <em data-effect="italics">The Wealth of Nations</em>, which was published in 1776, the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171472075366">Representative government and capitalism developed together in the United States, and many Americans tend to equate <span data-type="term">democracy</span>, a political system in which people govern themselves, with capitalism. In theory, a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled, for good or bad, by government. Capitalism, in turn, relies on individualism. At the same time, successful capitalists prefer political systems over which they can exert at least some influence in order to maintain their liberty.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171472152150">Democracy and capitalism do not have to go hand in hand, however. Indeed, one might argue that a capitalist economic system might be bad for democracy in some respects. Although Smith theorized that capitalism would lead to prosperity for all, this has not necessarily been the case. Great gaps in wealth between the owners of major businesses, industries, and financial institutions and those who work for others in exchange for wages exist in many capitalist nations. In turn, great wealth may give a very small minority great influence over the government—a greater influence than that held by the majority of the population, which will be discussed later.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171472226136">Socialism is an alternative economic system. In socialist societies, the means of generating wealth, such as factories, large farms, and banks, are owned by the government and not by private individuals. The government accumulates wealth and then redistributes it to citizens, primarily in the form of social programs that provide such things as free or inexpensive health care, education, and childcare. In socialist countries, the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity, transportation systems like airlines and railroads, and telecommunications systems. In many socialist countries the government is an <span data-type="term">oligarchy</span>: only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government. For example, in China, the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171472201251">In the United States, the democratic government works closely together with its capitalist economic system. The interconnectedness of the two affects the way in which goods and services are distributed. The market provides many goods and services needed by Americans. For example, food, clothing, and housing are provided in ample supply by private businesses that earn a profit in return. These goods and services are known as <span data-type="term">private goods</span>.<a href="#auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_rf-1" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_rf-1">Paul A. Samuelson. 1954. “The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure,” <em data-effect="italics">Review of Economics and</em> <em data-effect="italics">Statistics</em> 36, No. 4: 387–389.</div></a> People can purchase what they need in the quantity in which they need it. This, of course, is the ideal. In reality, those who live in poverty cannot always afford to buy ample food and clothing to meet their needs, or the food and clothing that they can afford to buy in abundance is of inferior quality. Also, it is often difficult to find adequate housing; housing in the most desirable neighborhoods—those that have low crime rates and good schools—is often too expensive for poor or working-class (and sometimes middle-class) people to buy or rent.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171474406489">Thus, the market cannot provide everything (in enough quantity or at low enough costs) in order to meet everyone’s needs. Therefore, some goods are provided by the government. Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called <span data-type="term">public goods</span>. Two such public goods are national security and education. It is difficult to see how a private business could protect the United States from attack. How could it build its own armies and create plans for defense and attack? Who would pay the men and women who served? Where would the intelligence come from? Due to its ability to tax, draw upon the resources of an entire nation, and compel citizen compliance, only government is capable of protecting the nation.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171472085384">Similarly, public schools provide education for all children in the United States. Children of all religions, races and ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, and levels of academic ability can attend public schools free of charge from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. It would be impossible for private schools to provide an education for all of the nation’s children. Private schools do provide some education in the United States; however, they charge tuition, and only those parents who can afford to pay their fees (or whose children gain a scholarship) can attend these institutions. Some schools charge very high tuition, the equivalent to the tuition at a private college. If private schools were the only educational institutions, most poor and working-class children and many middle-class children would be uneducated. Private schooling is a type of good called a <span data-type="term">toll good</span>. Toll goods are available to many people, and many people can make use of them, but only if they can pay the price. They occupy a middle ground between public and private goods. All parents may send their children to public schools in the United States. They can choose to send their children to a private school, but the private school will charge them. On the other hand, public schools, which are operated by the government, provide free education so all children can attend school. Therefore, everyone in the nation benefits from the educated voters and workers produced by the public school system. Another distinction between public and private goods is that public goods are available to all, typically without additional charge.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171472102316">What other public goods does government provide in the United States? At the federal, state, and local level, government provides stability and security, not only in the form of a military but also in the form of police and fire departments. Government provides other valuable goods and services such as public education, public transportation, mail service, and food, housing, and health care for the poor (<a href="#auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_OSC_AmGov_01_01_Ambulance" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). If a house catches on fire, the fire department does not demand payment before they put the fire out. If someone breaks into a house and tries to harm the occupants, the police will try to protect them and arrest the intruder, but the police department will not request payment for services rendered. The provision of these goods and services is funded by citizens paying into the general tax base.</p>

<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171474372748">Government also performs the important job of protecting <span data-type="term">common goods</span>: goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply, such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water. Because everyone can use these goods, they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing. Some examples of common goods, private goods, public goods, and toll goods are listed below (<a href="#auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_OSC_AmGov_01_01_Goods" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171472258341">One of the many important things government does is regulate public access to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">common goods</span> like natural resources. Unlike public goods, which all people may use without charge, common goods are in limited supply. If more public schools are needed, the government can build more. If more firefighters or mail carriers are needed, the government can hire them. Public lands and wildlife, however, are not goods the government can simply multiply if supply falls due to demand. Indeed, if some people take too freely from the supply of common goods, there will not be enough left for others to use.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171474373314">Fish are one of the many common goods in which the government currently regulates access. It does so to ensure that certain species are not fished into extinction, thus depriving future generations of an important food source and a means to make a living. This idea is known as sustainability. Environmentalists want to set strict fishing limits on a variety of species. Commercial fishers resist these limits, claiming they are unnecessary and, if enforced, would drive them out of business (<a href="#auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_OSC_AmGov_01_01_Fishing" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Currently, fishing limits are set by a combination of scientists, politicians, local resource managers, and groups representing the interests of fishers.<a href="#auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_rf-3" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_rf-3">Juliet Elperin, “U.S. Tightens Fishing Policy, Setting 2012 Catch Limits for All Mandated Species,” <em data-effect="italics">Washington Post</em>, 8 January 2012.</div></a></p>

However, without government restrictions on the kinds and number of fish that can be caught, the fish population would decline and certain species could become extinct.

<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171472100415">Besides providing stability and goods and services for all, government also creates a structure by which goods and services can be made available to the people. In the United States, people elect representatives to city councils, state legislatures, and Congress. These bodies make laws to govern their respective jurisdictions. They also pass measures to raise money, through the imposition of taxes on such things as income, property, and sales. Local, state, and national governments also draft budgets to determine how the revenue taken in will be spent for services. On the local level, funds are allotted for education, police and fire departments, and maintenance of public parks. State governments allocate money for state colleges and universities, maintenance of state roads and bridges, and wildlife management, among other priorities. On the national level, money goes to such things as defense, Social Security, pensions for veterans, maintenance of federal courts and prisons, and management of national parks. At each level, representatives elected by the people try to secure funding for things that will benefit those who live in the areas they represent. Once money has been allocated, government agencies at each level then receive funds for the purposes mentioned above and use them to provide services to the public.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171474338961">Local, state, and national governments also make laws to maintain order and to ensure the efficient functioning of society, including the fair operation of the business marketplace. In the United States, for example, Congress passes laws regulating banking, and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories, the purity of food offered for sale, and the safety of toys and automobiles. In this way, government checks the actions of business, something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Smith</span> believed it should…almost entirely unregulated.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171474294150">Besides providing goods to citizens and maintaining public safety, most governments also provide a means for citizens to participate in government and to make their opinions known to those in power. Western democracies like the United States, Britain, France, and others protect citizens’ freedom of speech and the press. These nations, and others in the world, also allow citizens to vote.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171474428306">As noted earlier, politics is the process by which choices are made regarding how resources will be allocated and which economic and social policies government will pursue. Put more simply, politics is the process of who gets what and how. Politics involves choosing which values government will support and which it will not. If government chooses to support an ideal such as individualism, it may choose to loosen regulations on business and industry or to cut taxes so that people have more money to invest in business. If it chooses to support an ideal such as egalitarianism, which calls for equal treatment for all and the destruction of socioeconomic inequalities, it may raise taxes in order to be able to spend more on public education, public transportation, housing for the poor, and care for the elderly. If, for example, the government is more concerned with national security than with individual liberty, it may authorize the tapping of people’s phones and restrict what newspapers may publish. If liberty is more important, then government will place greater restrictions on the extent that law enforcement agencies can intrude upon citizens’ private communications. The political process and the input of citizens help determine the answer.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171474281328">Civic engagement, or the participation that connects citizens to government, is a vital ingredient of politics. In the United States, citizens play an important role in influencing what policies are pursued, what values the government chooses to support, what initiatives are granted funding, and who gets to make the final decisions. Political engagement can take many forms: reading about politics, listening to news reports, discussing politics, attending (or watching televised) political debates, donating money to political campaigns, handing out flyers promoting a candidate, voting, joining protest marches, and writing letters to their elected representatives.</p>

<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171474295462">The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which <span data-type="term">political power</span>—influence over institutions, leaders, and policies—rests in the hands of the people. In a <span data-type="term">representative democracy</span>, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor <span data-type="term">majority rule</span>: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it, the law will be enacted.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171472203536">However, in representative governments like the United States, <span data-type="term">minority rights</span> are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let’s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights.<a href="#auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_rf-4" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_rf-4">Michael Lipka. 5 November 2015. “7 Facts about Atheists,” http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/05/7-facts-about-atheists/.</div></a> Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States.</p>
<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171474327827">In a <span data-type="term">direct democracy</span>, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy—the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government—some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot for citizens to vote on directly during state or local elections instead of leaving the matter in the hands of the state legislature. At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (<a href="#auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_OSC_AmGov_01_01_Meeting" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement.</p>

The following website contains such information:  https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index.
</div></a> At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government. In a <span data-type="term">monarchy</span>, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party’s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under <span data-type="term">totalitarianism</span>, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens’ lives. Citizens’ rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government.</p><figure id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_OSC_AmGov_01_01_FormsofGov"><figcaption>The map of the world shows the different forms of government that currently exist. Countries that are colored blue have some form of representative democracy, although the people may not have as much political power as they do in the United States. Countries that are colored red, like China, Vietnam, and Cuba, have an oligarchic form of government. Countries that are colored yellow are monarchies where the people play little part in governing.</figcaption>

<p id="auto_eb050d47-697c-412f-a5d0-0e30be4efd91_fs-id1171474421232">Government provides stability to society, as well as many crucial services such as free public education, police and fire services, and mail delivery. It also regulates access to common goods, such as public land, for the benefit of all. Government creates a structure whereby people can make their needs and opinions known to public officials. This is one of the key factors that makes the United States a representative democracy. A country where people elect representatives to make political decisions for them depends on the ability and willingness of ordinary people to make their voices known, unlike an oligarchy dominated by only a small group of people.</p>

<p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171472143217">The United States allows its citizens to participate in government in many ways. The United States also has many different levels and branches of government that any citizen or group might approach. Many people take this as evidence that U.S. citizens, especially as represented by competing groups, are able to influence government actions. Some political theorists, however, argue that this is not the case. They claim that only a handful of economic and political elites have any influence over government.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171472069185"><h3 data-type="title">ELITISM VS. PLURALISM</h3>
<p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171474307435">Many Americans fear that a set of elite citizens is really in charge of government in the United States and that others have no influence. This belief is called the <span data-type="term">elite theory</span> of government. In contrast to that perspective is the <span data-type="term">pluralist theory</span> of government, which says that political power rests with competing interest groups who share influence in government. Pluralist theorists assume that citizens who want to get involved in the system do so because of the great number of access points to government. That is, the U.S. system, with several levels and branches, has many places where people and groups can engage the government.</p>
<p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171472068209">The foremost supporter of elite theory was C. Wright <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Mills</span>. In his book, <em data-effect="italics">The Power Elite</em>, Mills argued that government was controlled by a combination of business, military, and political elites.<a href="#auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-5" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-5">C.

According to elite theory, the wealthy use their power to control the nation’s economy in such a way that those below them cannot advance economically. Their wealth allows the elite to secure for themselves important positions in politics. They then use this power to make decisions and allocate resources in ways that benefit them. Politicians do the bidding of the wealthy instead of attending to the needs of ordinary people, and order is maintained by force. Indeed, those who favor government by the elite believe the elite are better fit to govern and that average citizens are content to allow them to do so.<a href="#auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-6" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-6">Jack L.

For example, changes in the way taxes are levied and spent do not affect all citizens equally. A flat tax, which generally requires that everyone pay the same percentage rate, hurts the poor more than it does the rich. If the income tax rate was flat at 10 percent, all Americans would have to pay 10 percent of their income to the federal government. Someone who made $40,000 a year would have to pay $4,000 and be left with only $36,000 to live on. Someone who made $1,000,000 would have to pay $100,000, a greater sum, but he or she would still be left with $900,000. People who were not wealthy would probably pay more than they could comfortably afford, while the wealthy, who could afford to pay more and still live well, would not see a real impact on their daily lives. Similarly, the allocation of revenue affects the rich and the poor differently. Giving more money to public education does not benefit the wealthy as much as it does the poor, because the wealthy are more likely than the poor to send their children to private schools or to at least have the option of doing so. However, better funded public schools have the potential to greatly improve the upward mobility of members of other socioeconomic classes who have no other option than to send their children to public schools.</p>
<p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171472222795">Currently, about 40 percent of the members of Congress are millionaires; twelve members hold over half of the Congress's collective net worth.<a href="#auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-11" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-11">Paul V.

Overall, only 11 percent of the American population did so.<a href="#auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-12" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-12">Lindsey Burke. 20 April 2009. “How Members of the 111th Congress Practice Private School Choice.” The Heritage Foundation. https://www.heritage.org/education/report/how-members-the-111th-congress-practice-private-school-choice.</div></a> Therefore, a Congress dominated by millionaires who send their children to private schools is more likely to believe that flat taxes are fair and that increased funding for public education is not a necessity.

Instead, pluralists argue, political power is distributed throughout society.

<p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171474335024">According to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">pluralist theory</span>, people with shared interests will form groups in order to make their desires known to politicians. These groups include such entities as environmental advocates, unions, and organizations that represent the interests of various businesses. Because most people lack the inclination, time, or expertise necessary to decide political issues, these groups will speak for them. As groups compete with one another and find themselves in conflict regarding important issues, government policy begins to take shape. In this way, government policy is shaped from the bottom up and not from the top down, as we see in elitist theory. Robert <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Dahl</span>, author of <em data-effect="italics">Who Governs?</em>, was one of the first to advance the pluralist theory, and argued that politicians seeking an “electoral payoff” are attentive to the concerns of politically active citizens and, through them, become acquainted with the needs of ordinary people.

<p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171474177293">Although elitists and pluralists present political influence as a tug-of-war with people at opposite ends of a rope trying to gain control of government, in reality government action and public policy are influenced by an ongoing series of tradeoffs or compromises. For instance, an action that will meet the needs of large numbers of people may not be favored by the elite members of society. Giving the elite what they want may interfere with plans to help the poor. As pluralists argue, public policy is created as a result of competition among groups. In the end, the interests of both the elite and the people likely influence government action, and compromises will often attempt to please them both.</p>
<p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171474256546">Since the framing of the U.S. Constitution, tradeoffs have been made between those who favor the supremacy of the central government and those who believe that state governments should be more powerful. Should state governments be able to respond to the desires of citizen groups by legalizing the use of marijuana? Should the national government be able to close businesses that sell marijuana even in states where it is legal? Should those who control the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Agency (NSA) be allowed to eavesdrop on phone conversations of Americans and read their email? Should groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which protect all citizens’ rights to freedom of speech, be able to prevent this?</p>
<p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171474222198">Many of the tradeoffs made by government are about freedom of speech. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">First Amendment</span> of the Constitution gives Americans the right to express their opinions on matters of concern to them; the federal government cannot interfere with this right. Because of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Fourteenth Amendment</span>, state governments must protect this right also. At the same time, neither the federal government nor state governments can allow someone’s right to free expression to interfere with someone else’s ability to exercise his or her own rights. For example, in the United States, it is legal for women to have abortions. Many people oppose this right, primarily for religious reasons, and often protest outside facilities that provide abortions. In 2007, the state of Massachusetts enacted a law that required protestors to stand thirty-five feet away from clinic entrances. The intention was to prevent women seeking abortions from being harassed or threatened with violence. Groups favoring the protection of women’s reproductive rights supported the law. Groups opposed to abortion argued that the buffer zone prevented them from speaking to women to try to persuade them not to have the procedure done. In 2014, in the case of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis"><em data-effect="italics">McCullen v. Coakley</em></span>, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the law that created a buffer zone between protestors and clinic entrances.<a href="#auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-16" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-16"><em data-effect="italics">McCullen v. Coakley</em>, 573 U.S. __ (2014); Melissa Jeltsen, “The Reality of Abortion Clinics without Buffer Zones,” <em data-effect="italics">The Huffington Post</em>, 13 July 2014.</div></a> The federal government does not always side with those who oppose abortion, however. Several states have attempted to pass laws requiring women to notify their husbands, and often obtain their consent, before having an abortion. All such laws have been found unconstitutional by the courts.</p>
<p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171474311958">Tradeoffs also occur as a result of conflict between groups representing the competing interests of citizens. Many Americans believe that the U.S. must become less dependent on foreign sources of energy. Many also would like people to have access to inexpensive sources of energy. Such people are likely to support fracking: the process of hydraulic fracturing that gives drilling companies access to natural gas trapped between layers of shale underground. Fracking produces abundant, inexpensive natural gas, a great benefit to people who live in parts of the country where it is expensive to heat homes during the winter. Fracking also creates jobs. At the same time, many scholars argue that fracking can result in the contamination of drinking water, air pollution, and increased risk of earthquakes. One study has even linked fracking to cancer. Thus, those who want to provide jobs and inexpensive natural gas are in conflict with those who wish to protect the natural environment and human health (<a href="#auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_OSC_AmGov_01_02_Fracking" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Both sides are well intentioned, but they disagree over what is best for people.<a href="#auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-17" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-17">Gail Bambrick. 11 December 2012. “Fracking: Pro and Con,” https://now.tufts.edu/articles/fracking-pro-and-con.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171472062628">Tradeoffs are especially common in the United States Congress. Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives usually vote according to the concerns of people who live in their districts. Not only does this often pit the interests of people in different parts of the country against one another, but it also frequently favors the interests of certain groups of people over the interests of others within the same state. For example, allowing oil companies to drill off the state’s coast may please those who need the jobs that will be created, but it will anger those who wish to preserve coastal lands as a refuge for wildlife and, in the event of an accident, may harm the interests of people who depend on fishing and tourism for their living. At times, House members and senators in Congress may ignore the voters in their home states and the groups that represent them in order to follow the dictates of the leaders of the political party to which they belong. For example, a member of Congress from a state with a large elderly population may be inclined to vote in favor of legislation to increase benefits for retired people; however, his or her political party leaders, who disapprove of government spending on social programs, may ask for a vote against it. The opposite can occur as well, especially in the case of a legislator soon facing re-election. With two-year terms of office, we are more likely to see House members buck their party in favor of their constituents.</p>
<p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171472090832">Finally, the government may attempt to resolve conflicting concerns within the nation as a whole through tradeoffs. After repeated incidents of mass shootings at schools, theaters, churches, concerts, night clubs, and shopping malls, many are concerned with protecting themselves and their families from firearm violence. Some groups would like to ban the sale of automatic weapons completely. Some do not want to ban gun ownership; they merely want greater restrictions to be put in place on who can buy guns or how long people must wait between the time they enter the store to make a purchase and the time when they are actually given possession of the weapon. Others represent the interests of those who oppose any restrictions on the number or type of weapons Americans may own. So far, state governments have attempted to balance the interests of both groups by placing restrictions on such things as who can sell guns, where gun sales may take place, or requirements for background checks, but they have not attempted to ban gun sales altogether. For example, although federal law does not require private gun dealers (people who sell guns but do not derive most of their income from doing so) to conduct background checks before selling firearms to people at gun shows, some states have passed laws requiring this.<a href="#auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-18" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_rf-18">“Gun Show Background Checks State Laws,” http://www.governing.com/gov-data/safety-justice/gun-show-firearms-bankground-checks-state-laws-map.html (February 18, 2016).</div></a></p><p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_eip-366">At the federal level, there has been widespread support in Congress to improve the background checking process.

<p id="auto_93d9cc58-fda5-4e87-8440-4d955adac103_fs-id1171474482294">Many question whether politicians are actually interested in the needs of average citizens and debate how much influence ordinary people have over what government does. Those who support the elite theory of government argue that a small, wealthy, powerful elite controls government and makes policy to benefit its members and perpetuate their power. Others favor the pluralist theory, which maintains that groups representing the people’s interests do attract the attention of politicians and can influence government policy. In reality, government policy usually is the result of a series of tradeoffs as groups and elites fight with one another for influence and politicians attempt to balance the demands of competing interests, including the interests of the constituents who elected them to office.</p>

<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472178808">Participation in government matters. Although people may not get all that they want, they can achieve many goals and improve their lives through civic engagement. According to the pluralist theory, government cannot function without active participation by at least some citizens. Even if we believe the elite make political decisions, participation in government through the act of voting can change who the members of the elite are.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472214331"><h3 data-type="title">WHY GET INVOLVED?</h3>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171471916973">Are fewer people today active in politics than in the past? Political scientist Robert <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Putnam</span> has argued that <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">civic engagement</span> is declining; although many Americans may report belonging to groups, these groups are usually large, impersonal ones with thousands of members. People who join groups such as Amnesty International or Greenpeace may share certain values and ideals with other members of the group, but they do not actually interact with these other members. These organizations are different from the types of groups Americans used to belong to, like church groups or bowling leagues. Although people are still interested in volunteering and working for the public good, they are more interested in either working individually or joining large organizations where they have little opportunity to interact with others. Putnam considers a number of explanations for this decline in small group membership, including increased participation by women in the workforce, a decrease in the number of marriages and an increase in divorces, and the effect of technological developments, such as the internet, that separate people by allowing them to feel connected to others without having to spend time in their presence.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-19" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-19">Robert D.

This, in turn, has hurt people’s willingness and ability to engage in representative government. If Putnam is correct, this trend is unfortunate, because becoming active in government and community organizations is important for many reasons.</p>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_eip-177">Some have countered Putnam’s thesis and argue that participation is in better shape than what he portrays. Everett Ladd shows many positive trends in social involvement in American communities that serve to soften some of the declines identified by Putnam. For example, while bowling league participation is down, soccer league participation has proliferated.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_soccer-20" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_soccer-20">Everett Ladd. <em data-effect="italics">The Ladd Report</em>. http://movies2.nytimes.com/books/first/l/ladd-report.html</div></a> April Clark examines and analyzes a wide variety of social capital data trends and disputes the original thesis of erosion.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_clark-20" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_clark-20">April Clark.

<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472074137">To learn more about political engagement in the United States, read <a href="https://openstax.org/l/29pewrescenrep">“The Current State of Civic Engagement in America”</a> by the Pew Research Center.</p>

<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472163993">Civic engagement can increase the power of ordinary people to influence government actions. Even those without money or connections to important people can influence the policies that affect their lives and change the direction taken by government. U.S. history is filled with examples of people actively challenging the power of elites, gaining rights for themselves, and protecting their interests. For example, slavery was once legal in the United States and large sectors of the U.S. economy were dependent on this forced labor. Slavery was outlawed and Black people were granted citizenship because of the actions of abolitionists. Although some abolitionists were wealthy White men, most were ordinary people, including men and women of both races. White women and Black people were able to actively assist in the campaign to end slavery despite the fact that, with few exceptions, they were unable to vote. Similarly, the right to vote once belonged solely to White men until the Fifteenth Amendment gave the vote to African American men. The Nineteenth Amendment extended the vote to include women, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made exercising the right to vote a reality for African American men and women in the South. None of this would have happened, however, without the efforts of people who marched in protest, participated in boycotts, delivered speeches, wrote letters to politicians, and sometimes risked arrest in order to be heard (<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_OSC_AmGov_01_03_Amendment" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The tactics used to influence the government and effect change by abolitionists and members of the women’s rights and African American civil rights movements are still used by many activists today.</p>

<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472157702">The rights gained by these activists and others have dramatically improved the quality of life for many in the United States. Civil rights legislation did not focus solely on the right to vote or to hold public office; it also integrated schools and public accommodations, prohibited discrimination in housing and employment, and increased access to higher education. Activists for <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">women’s rights</span> fought for, and won, greater reproductive freedom for women, better wages, and access to credit. Only a few decades ago, homosexuality was considered a mental disorder, and intercourse between consenting adults of the same sex was illegal in many states. Although legal discrimination against gays and lesbians still remains, consensual intercourse between gay and lesbian adults is no longer illegal anywhere in the United States, same-sex couples have the right to legally marry, and LGBTQ people are better protected against employment discrimination.</p>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472058498">Activism can improve people’s lives in less dramatic ways as well. Working to make cities clean up vacant lots, destroy or rehabilitate abandoned buildings, build more parks and playgrounds, pass ordinances requiring people to curb their dogs, and ban late-night noise greatly affects people’s quality of life. The actions of individual Americans can make their own lives better and improve their neighbors’ lives as well.</p>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472079232">Representative democracy cannot work effectively without the participation of informed citizens, however. Engaged citizens familiarize themselves with the most important issues confronting the country and with the plans different candidates have for dealing with those issues. Then they vote for the candidates they believe will be best suited to the job, and they may join others to raise funds or campaign for those they support. They inform their representatives how they feel about important issues. Through these efforts and others, engaged citizens let their representatives know what they want and thus influence policy. Only then can government actions accurately reflect the interests and concerns of the majority. Even people who believe the elite rule government should recognize that it is easier for them to do so if ordinary people make no effort to participate in public life.</p>

<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472152150">People can become civically engaged in many ways, either as individuals or as members of groups. Some forms of individual engagement require very little effort. One of the simplest ways is to stay informed about debates and events in the community, in the state, and in the nation. Awareness is the first step toward engagement. News is available from a variety of reputable sources, such as newspapers like the <em data-effect="italics">New York Times</em>; national news shows, including those offered by the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio; and reputable internet sites.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472097876" class="american government link-to-learning">

</div>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472156313">Another form of individual engagement is to write or email political representatives. Filing a complaint with the city council is another avenue of engagement. City officials cannot fix problems if they do not know anything is wrong to begin with. Responding to public opinion polls, actively contributing to a political blog, or starting a new blog are all examples of different ways to be involved.</p>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171471917574">One of the most basic ways to engage with government as an individual is to vote (<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_OSC_AmGov_01_03_EarlyVote" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Individual votes do matter. City council members, mayors, state legislators, governors, and members of Congress are all chosen by popular vote. Although the president of the United States is not chosen directly by popular vote but by a group called the Electoral College, the votes of individuals in their home states determine how the Electoral College ultimately votes. Registering to vote beforehand is necessary in most states, but it is usually a simple process, and many states allow registration online. (We discuss voter registration and voter turnout in more depth in a later chapter.)</p>

<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472106595">Voting, however, is not the only form of political engagement in which people may participate. Individuals can engage by attending political rallies, donating money to campaigns, and signing petitions. Starting a petition of one’s own is relatively easy, and some websites that encourage people to become involved in political activism provide petitions that can be circulated through email. Taking part in a poll or survey is another simple way to make your voice heard.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171474412783" class="milestone"><div data-type="title" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_3">Votes for Eighteen-Year-Olds</div>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171471916864">Young Americans are often reluctant to become involved in traditional forms of political activity. They may believe politicians are not interested in what they have to say, or they may feel their votes do not matter. However, this attitude has not always prevailed. Indeed, today’s college students can vote because of the activism of college students in the 1960s. Most states at that time required citizens to be twenty-one years of age before they could vote in national elections. This angered many young people, especially young men who could be drafted to fight the war in Vietnam. They argued that it was unfair to deny eighteen-year-olds the right to vote for the people who had the power to send them to war. As a result, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Twenty-Sixth Amendment</span>, which lowered the voting age in national elections to eighteen, was ratified by the states and went into effect in 1971.</p>

</div>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472028927">Some people prefer to work with groups when participating in political activities or performing service to the community. Group activities can be as simple as hosting a book club or discussion group to talk about politics. Coffee Party USA provides an online forum for people from a variety of political perspectives to discuss issues that are of concern to them. People who wish to be more active often work for political campaigns. Engaging in fundraising efforts, handing out bumper stickers and campaign buttons, helping people register to vote, and driving voters to the polls on Election Day are all important activities that anyone can engage in. Individual citizens can also join interest groups that promote the causes they favor.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472156087" class="get-connected"><div data-type="title" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_4">Getting Involved</div>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171474478794">In many ways, the pluralists were right. There is plenty of room for average citizens to become active in government, whether it is through a city council subcommittee or another type of local organization. Civic organizations always need volunteers, sometimes for only a short while and sometimes for much longer.</p>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472120148">For example, <a href="https://openstax.org/l/29comcause">Common Cause</a> is a non-partisan organization that seeks to hold government accountable for its actions. It calls for campaign finance reform and paper verification of votes registered on electronic voting machines. Voters would then receive proof that the machine recorded their actual vote. This would help to detect faulty machines that were inaccurately tabulating votes or election fraud. Therefore, one could be sure that election results were reliable and that the winning candidate had in fact received the votes counted in their favor. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Common Cause</span> has also advocated that the Electoral College be done away with and that presidential elections be decided solely on the basis of the popular vote.</p>

This is particularly true of young Americans. Although young people today often shy away from participating in traditional political activities, they do express deep concern for their communities and seek out volunteer opportunities.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-21" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-21">Jared Keller. 4 May 2015. “Young Americans are Opting Out of Politics, but Not Because They’re Cynical,” http://www.psmag.com/politics-and-law/young-people-are-not-so-politically-inclined.</div></a> Although they may not realize it, becoming active in the community and engaging in a wide variety of community-based volunteer efforts are important forms of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">civic engagement</span> and help government do its job. The demands on government are great, and funds do not always exist to enable it to undertake all the projects it may deem necessary. Even when there are sufficient funds, politicians have differing ideas regarding how much government should do and what areas it should be active in. Volunteers and community organizations help fill the gaps. Examples of community action include tending a community garden, building a house for Habitat for Humanity, cleaning up trash in a vacant lot, volunteering to deliver meals to the elderly, and tutoring children in after-school programs (<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_OSC_AmGov_01_03_Volunteer" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

Such tactics were used successfully in the African American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and remain effective today. Likewise, the sit-ins (and sleep-ins and pray-ins) staged by African American <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">civil rights</span> activists, which they employed successfully to desegregate lunch counters, motels, and churches, have been adopted today by movements such as Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street (<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_OSC_AmGov_01_03_Occupy" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Other tactics, such as boycotting businesses of whose policies the activists disapproved, are also still common. Along with boycotts, there are now “buycotts,” in which consumers purchase goods and services from companies that give extensively to charity, help the communities in which they are located, or take steps to protect the environment.</p>

Torres became interested in social justice early in his life. He was raised in poverty in the Bronx by his mother and a stepfather who left the family when Torres was twelve. The mold in his family’s public housing apartment caused him to suffer from asthma as a child, and he spent time in the hospital on more than one occasion because of it. His mother’s complaints to the New York City Housing Authority were largely ignored. In high school, Torres decided to become a lawyer, participated in mock trials, and met a young and aspiring local politician named James <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Vacca</span>. After graduation, he volunteered to campaign for Vacca in his run for a seat on the City Council. After Vacca was elected, he hired Torres to serve as his housing director to reach out to the community on Vacca’s behalf. While doing so, Torres took pictures of the poor conditions in public housing and collected complaints from residents. In 2013, Torres ran for a seat on the City Council himself and won.

A survey conducted in 2018 revealed that almost 70 percent of American adults had participated in some type of political action in the past five years. These activities included largely non-personal activities that did not require a great deal of interaction with others, such as signing petitions, expressing opinions on social media, contacting elected representatives, or contributing money to campaigns. During the same period, approximately 30 percent of people attended a local government meeting or a political rally or event, while 16 percent worked or volunteered for a campaign.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-23" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-23">Pew Research Center. 26 April 2018. “Political Engagement, Knowledge, and the Midterms.” http://www.people-press.org/2018/04/26/10-political-engagement-knowledge-and-the-midterms/.</div></a></p><p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171474194840">Americans aged 18–29 were less likely to become involved in traditional forms of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">political activity</span> than older Americans. A 2018 poll of more than two thousand young adults by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics revealed that only 24 percent claimed to be politically engaged, and fewer than 35 percent said that they had voted in a primary. Only 9 percent said that they had gone to a political demonstration, rally, or march.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-24" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-24">Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. 17 October 2018. <em data-effect="italics">Survey of Young Americans’ Attitudes toward Politics and Public Service</em>. https://iop.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/content/Harvard-IOP-Fall-2018-poll-toplines.pdf.</div></a> However, in the 2018 midterm elections, an estimated 31 percent of Americans under thirty turned out to vote, the highest level of young adult engagement in decades.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-25" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-25">Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE). 7 November 2018. “Young People Dramatically Increase Their Turnout to 31%, Shape 2018 Midterm Elections.” CIRCLE. https://civicyouth.org/young-people-dramatically-increase-their-turnout-31-percent-shape-2018-midterm-elections/.</div></a></p><p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171474224233">Why are younger Americans less likely to become involved in traditional political organizations? One answer may be that as American politics become more partisan in nature, young people turn away. Committed <span data-type="term">partisanship</span>, which is the tendency to identify with and to support (often blindly) a particular political party, alienates some Americans who feel that elected representatives should vote in support of the nation’s best interests instead of voting in the way their party wishes them to. When elected officials ignore all factors other than their party’s position on a particular issue, some voters become disheartened while others may become polarized. However, a recent study reveals that it is a distrust of the opposing party and not an ideological commitment to their own party that is at the heart of most partisanship among voters.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-26" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-26">Marc Hetherington and Thomas Rudolph, “Why Don’t Americans Trust the Government?” <em data-effect="italics">The Washington Post</em>, 30 January 2014.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171474228106">Young Americans are particularly likely to be put off by partisan politics. More Americans under the age of thirty now identify themselves as Independents instead of Democrats or Republicans (<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_OSC_AmGov_01_03_Harvard15" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Instead of identifying with a particular political party, young Americans are increasingly concerned about specific issues, such as same-sex marriage.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-27" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-27">Keller, “Young Americans are Opting Out.”</div></a> People whose votes are determined based on single issues are unlikely to vote according to party affiliation. </p><p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_eip-946">The other factor involved in low youth voter turnout in the past was that younger Americans did not feel that candidates generally tackle issues relevant to their lives. When younger voters cannot relate to the issues put forth in a campaign, such as entitlements for seniors, they lose interest. This dynamic changed somewhat in 2016 as Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders made college costs an issue, even promising free college tuition for undergraduates at public institutions. Senator Sanders enjoyed intense support on college campuses across the United States. After his nomination campaign failed, this young voter enthusiasm faded. Despite the fact that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton eventually took up the free tuition issue, young people did not flock to her as well as they had to Sanders. In the general election, won by Republican nominee Donald Trump, turnout was down and Clinton received a smaller proportion of the youth vote than President Obama had in 2012.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-27b" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-27b">Tami Luhby and Jennifer Agiesta. 8 November 2016. “Exit Polls: Clinton Fails to Energize African-Americans, Latinos and the Young, http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/first-exit-polls-2016/.</div></a></p><figure id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_OSC_AmGov_01_03_Harvard15"><figcaption>Young Americans are likely to identify as an Independent rather than a Democrat or a Republican.

This is especially true among the young. As some members of the Republican Party have become more ideologically conservative (e.g., opposing same-sex marriage, legalization of certain drugs, immigration reform, gun control, separation of church and state, and access to abortion), those young people who do identify with one of the major parties have in recent years tended to favor the Democratic Party.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-28" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-28">Harvard Institute of Politics, “No Front-Runner among Prospective Republican Candidates,” http://iop.harvard.edu/no-front-runner-among-prospective-republican-candidates-hillary-clinton-control-democratic-primary (May 2, 2016).</div></a> Of the Americans under age thirty who were surveyed by Harvard in 2015, more tended to hold a favorable opinion of Democrats in Congress than of Republicans, and 56 percent reported that they wanted the Democrats to win the presidency in 2016 (<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_OSC_AmGov_01_03_Harvard15" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Even those young Americans who identify themselves as Republicans are more liberal on certain issues, such as being supportive of same-sex marriage and immigration reform, than are older Republicans. The young Republicans also may be more willing to see similarities between themselves and Democrats.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-29" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-29">Jocelyn Kiley and Michael Dimock. 25 September 2014. “The GOP’s Millennial Problem Runs Deep,” http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/25/the-gops-millennial-problem-runs-deep/.</div></a> Once again, support for the views of a particular party does not necessarily mean that someone will vote for members of that party.</p>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171474477735">Other factors may keep even those college students who do wish to vote away from the polls. Because many young Americans attend colleges and universities outside of their home states, they may find it difficult to register to vote. In places where a state-issued ID is required, students may not have one or may be denied one if they cannot prove that they paid in-state tuition rates.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-30" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-30">“Keeping Students from the Polls,” <em data-effect="italics">New York Times</em>, 26 December 2011.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472139891">The likelihood that people will become active in politics also depends not only on age but on such factors as wealth and education. In a 2006 poll, the percentage of people who reported that they were regular voters grew as levels of income and education increased.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-31" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-31">18 October 2006. “Who Votes, Who Doesn’t, and Why,” http://www.people-press.org/2006/10/18/who-votes-who-doesnt-and-why/.</div></a> Political involvement also depends on how strongly people feel about current political issues. Unfortunately, public opinion polls, which politicians may rely on when formulating policy or deciding how to vote on issues, capture only people’s <span data-type="term">latent preferences</span> or beliefs. Latent preferences are not deeply held and do not remain the same over time. They may not even represent a person’s true feelings, since they may be formed on the spot when someone is asked a question about which he or she has no real opinion. Indeed, voting itself may reflect merely a latent preference because even people who do not feel strongly about a particular political candidate or issue vote. On the other hand, <span data-type="term">intense preferences</span> are based on strong feelings regarding an issue that someone adheres to over time. People with intense preferences tend to become more engaged in politics; they are more likely to donate time and money to campaigns or to attend political rallies. The more money that one has and the more highly educated one is, the more likely that he or she will form intense preferences and take political action.<a href="#auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-32" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_rf-32">Jonathan M.

<p id="auto_5eab7fe7-562f-4e15-b77c-3ff42fa77040_fs-id1171472069655">Civic and political engagement allows politicians to know how the people feel. It also improves people’s lives and helps them to build connections with others. Individuals can educate themselves on important issues and events, write to their senator or representative, file a complaint at city hall, attend a political rally, or vote. People can also work in groups to campaign or raise funds for a candidate, volunteer in the community, or protest a social injustice or an unpopular government policy. Although wealthier, older, more highly educated citizens are the most likely to be engaged with their government, especially if they have intense preferences about an issue, younger, less wealthy people can do much to change their communities and their country.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227605088">When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227725621">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. —That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, —That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. —Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227573709">He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227596975">He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227606556">He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227438063">He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227606874">He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227777248">He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227666750">He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227567133">He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227507849">He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227557868">He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227605749">He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227564776">He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227601393">He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227664871">For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227443638">For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227727038">For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227674250">For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227602739">For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227655346">For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227576907">For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227590038">For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227394485">For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227606616">He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227404923">He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227682700">He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227571648">He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227350649">He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227718196">In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227708551">Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</p>

<p id="auto_634b2a40-8f9d-4eca-b8b4-9f8df33f556b_fs-id1166227729482">We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>
