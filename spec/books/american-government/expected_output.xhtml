However, like any professional-grade textbook, errors sometimes occur. In addition, the wide range of topics, data, and legal circumstances in goverment and politics change frequently, and portions of the textbook may become out of date. Since our books are web based, we can make updates periodically when deemed pedagogically necessary. If you have a correction to suggest, submit it through the link on your book page on openstax.org. Subject matter experts review all errata suggestions. OpenStax is committed to remaining transparent about all updates, so you will also find a list of past errata changes on your book page on openstax.org.</p>

We have endeavored to make the government workings, issues, debates, and impacts meaningful and memorable to students while maintaining the conceptual coverage and rigor inherent in the subject at the college level. With this objective in mind, the content of this textbook has been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from the fundamental principles of institutional design at the founding, to avenues of political participation, to thorough coverage of the political structures that constitute American government. The book builds upon what students have already learned and emphasizes connections between topics as well as between theory and applications. The goal of each section is to enable students not just to recognize concepts, but to work with them in ways that will be useful in later courses, future careers, and as engaged citizens. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from a diverse group of American government instructors.</p>

        <h3 data-type="title">Changes to the third edition</h3>
        <p id="auto_3ddde3e1-0765-4692-a525-58f481af278b_eip-283">
Because the discipline of political science looks closely at our nation&#x2019;s people, communities, and systems, introductory government texts must remain grounded in scholarship yet attuned to current events and emerging issues. Updates include improvements based on feedback from users, including expanded coverage of historical content on civil rights, and current examples of issues regarding civil rights and civil liberties. The driving principle of these changes is to help students understand that government is neither distant nor unreachable, but that it has personal influences and human impacts. The authors and reviewers sought to confront and illuminate the negative and hurtful aspects of our nation and its history, while demonstrating societal and individual progress. In doing so, the approach seeks to provide instructors with ample opportunities to open discussions, extend and update concepts, and drive deeper engagement.

        <p id="auto_3ddde3e1-0765-4692-a525-58f481af278b_eip-idm2265274256">In addition to ensuring data is as current as possible across the book&#x2019;s narrative text, graphs and charts have been revised for currency as appropriate. Throughout the book, examples, illustrations, and photographs on selected topics have been updated to ensure they are timely and relevant to students today.  <em data-effect="italics">American Government 3e </em>incorporates the transition to a new administration in 2021 and associated changes across branches, as well as ongoing and recent societal issues. The COVID-19 pandemic is referenced frequently, providing additional opportunities for students to share their own stories, and for instructors to lead into more current government actions and outcomes. The revisions are focused on careful and balanced treatment of the events and developments of recent years, and the manner in which those developments connect to core concepts. </p>

          <li><strong data-effect="bold">Learning Objectives.</strong> Every module begins with a set of clear and concise learning objectives. These objectives are designed to help the instructor decide what content to include or assign, and to guide students with respect to what they can expect to learn. After completing the module and end-of-module exercises, students should be able to demonstrate mastery of the learning objectives.</li>
          <li><strong data-effect="bold">Summaries.</strong> Section summaries distill the information in each module for both students and instructors down to key, concise points addressed in the section.</li>
          <li><strong data-effect="bold">Key Terms.</strong> Key terms are in bold and are followed by a definition in context. Definitions of key terms are also listed in the Glossary, which appears at the end of the chapter.</li>
          <li><strong data-effect="bold">Assessments.</strong> Multiple-choice and short-answer Review Questions provide opportunities to recall and test the information students learn throughout each module. End-of-chapter Critical Thinking Questions encourage deeper reflection on the chapter concepts and themes.</li>

This civic engagement ensures that representative democracy will continue to flourish and that people will continue to influence government. The right of citizens to participate in government is an important feature of democracy, and over the centuries many have fought to acquire and defend this right. During the American Revolution (1775&#x2013;1783), British colonists fought for the right to govern themselves. In the early nineteenth century, agitated citizens called for the removal of property requirements for voting so poor White men could participate in government just as wealthy men could. Throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, women, African Americans, Native Americans, and many other groups fought for the right to vote and hold office. </p>
              <p id="auto_47f8f28a-cfb1-4323-8f23-c7bd71856e99_fs-id1171472143696">The poster shown above (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_47f8f28a-cfb1-4323-8f23-c7bd71856e99_OSC_AmGov_01_00_Voting">Figure 1.1</a>), created during World War II, depicts voting as an important part of the fight to keep the United States free. The purpose of voting and other forms of political engagement is to ensure that government serves the people, and not the other way around. But what does government do to serve the people? What different forms of government exist? How do they differ? How can citizens best engage with and participate in the crucial process of governing the nation? This chapter seeks to answer these questions.</p>

What we eat, where we go to school, what kind of education we receive, how our tax money is spent, and what we do in our free time are all affected by government. Americans are often unaware of the pervasiveness of government in their everyday lives, and many are unsure precisely what it does. Here we will look at what government is, what it does, and how the government of the United States differs from other kinds of governments.</p>

Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity, secure national borders, and the safety and well-being of citizens. Governments also provide benefits for their citizens. The type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system, but governments commonly provide such things as education, health care, and an infrastructure for transportation. The term <span data-type="term" group-by="p" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term2">politics</span> refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals, especially those related to the division of resources within a nation.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171474345553">Sometimes <span data-type="term" group-by="g" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term3">governmental systems</span> are confused with <span data-type="term" group-by="e" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term4">economic systems</span>. This is because certain types of political thought or governmental organization are closely related to or develop with certain types of economic systems. For example, the economic system of capitalism in Western Europe and North America developed at roughly the same time as ideas about democratic republics, self-government, and natural rights. At this time, the idea of liberty became an important concept. According to John <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="L" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term5">Locke</span>, an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century, all people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed. In the eighteenth century, in Great Britain&#x2019;s North American colonies, and later in France, this developed into the idea that people should govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king; only those representatives chosen by the people had the right to make laws to govern them.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171474478721">Similarly, Adam <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="S" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term6">Smith</span>, a Scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after Locke&#x2019;s death, believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished. Instead of being controlled by government, business, and industry, Smith argued, people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work. Competition would ensure that prices remained low and faulty goods disappeared from the market. In this way, businesses would reap profits, consumers would have their needs satisfied, and society as a whole would prosper. Smith discussed these ideas, which formed the basis for industrial capitalism, in his book <em data-effect="italics">The Wealth of Nations</em>, which was published in 1776, the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171472075366">Representative government and <span data-type="term" group-by="c" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term7">capitalism</span> developed together in the United States, and many Americans tend to equate <span data-type="term" group-by="d" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term8">democracy</span>, a political system in which people govern themselves, with capitalism. In theory, a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled, for good or bad, by government. Capitalism, in turn, relies on individualism. At the same time, successful capitalists prefer political systems over which they can exert at least some influence in order to maintain their liberty.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171472152150">Democracy and capitalism do not have to go hand in hand, however. Indeed, one might argue that a capitalist economic system might be bad for democracy in some respects. Although Smith theorized that capitalism would lead to prosperity for all, this has not necessarily been the case. Great gaps in wealth between the owners of major businesses, industries, and financial institutions and those who work for others in exchange for wages exist in many capitalist nations. In turn, great wealth may give a very small minority great influence over the government&#x2014;a greater influence than that held by the majority of the population, which will be discussed later.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171472226136"><span data-type="term" group-by="S" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term9">Socialism</span> is an alternative economic system. In socialist societies, the means of generating wealth, such as factories, large farms, and banks, are owned by the government and not by private individuals. The government accumulates wealth and then redistributes it to citizens, primarily in the form of social programs that provide such things as free or inexpensive health care, education, and childcare. In socialist countries, the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity, transportation systems like airlines and railroads, and telecommunications systems. In many socialist countries the government is an <span data-type="term" group-by="o" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term10">oligarchy</span>: only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government. For example, in China, the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171472201251">In the United States, the democratic government works closely together with its capitalist economic system. The interconnectedness of the two affects the way in which goods and services are distributed. The market provides many goods and services needed by Americans. For example, food, clothing, and housing are provided in ample supply by private businesses that earn a profit in return. These goods and services are known as <span data-type="term" group-by="p" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term11">private goods</span>.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_rf-1"><sup class="os-citation-number">1</sup></a> People can purchase what they need in the quantity in which they need it. This, of course, is the ideal. In reality, those who live in poverty cannot always afford to buy ample food and clothing to meet their needs, or the food and clothing that they can afford to buy in abundance is of inferior quality. Also, it is often difficult to find adequate housing; housing in the most desirable neighborhoods&#x2014;those that have low crime rates and good schools&#x2014;is often too expensive for poor or working-class (and sometimes middle-class) people to buy or rent.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171474406489">Thus, the market cannot provide everything (in enough quantity or at low enough costs) in order to meet everyone&#x2019;s needs. Therefore, some goods are provided by the government. Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called <span data-type="term" group-by="p" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term12">public goods</span>. Two such public goods are national security and education. It is difficult to see how a private business could protect the United States from attack. How could it build its own armies and create plans for defense and attack? Who would pay the men and women who served? Where would the intelligence come from? Due to its ability to tax, draw upon the resources of an entire nation, and compel citizen compliance, only government is capable of protecting the nation.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171472085384">Similarly, <span data-type="term" group-by="p" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term13">public schools</span> provide education for all children in the United States. Children of all religions, races and ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, and levels of academic ability can attend public schools free of charge from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. It would be impossible for <span data-type="term" group-by="p" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term14">private schools</span> to provide an education for all of the nation&#x2019;s children. Private schools do provide some education in the United States; however, they charge tuition, and only those parents who can afford to pay their fees (or whose children gain a scholarship) can attend these institutions. Some schools charge very high tuition, the equivalent to the tuition at a private college. If private schools were the only educational institutions, most poor and working-class children and many middle-class children would be uneducated. Private schooling is a type of good called a <span data-type="term" group-by="t" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term15">toll good</span>. Toll goods are available to many people, and many people can make use of them, but only if they can pay the price. They occupy a middle ground between public and private goods. All parents may send their children to public schools in the United States. They can choose to send their children to a private school, but the private school will charge them. On the other hand, public schools, which are operated by the government, provide free education so all children can attend school. Therefore, everyone in the nation benefits from the educated voters and workers produced by the public school system. Another distinction between public and private goods is that public goods are available to all, typically without additional charge.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171472102316">What other public goods does government provide in the United States? At the federal, state, and local level, government provides stability and security, not only in the form of a military but also in the form of police and fire departments. Government provides other valuable goods and services such as public education, public transportation, mail service, and food, housing, and health care for the poor (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_OSC_AmGov_01_01_Ambulance">Figure 1.2</a>). If a house catches on fire, the fire department does not demand payment before they put the fire out. If someone breaks into a house and tries to harm the occupants, the police will try to protect them and arrest the intruder, but the police department will not request payment for services rendered. The provision of these goods and services is funded by citizens paying into the general tax base.</p>

Unlike public goods, which all people may use without charge, common goods are in limited supply. If more public schools are needed, the government can build more. If more firefighters or mail carriers are needed, the government can hire them. Public lands and wildlife, however, are not goods the government can simply multiply if supply falls due to demand. Indeed, if some people take too freely from the supply of common goods, there will not be enough left for others to use.</p>

It does so to ensure that certain species are not fished into extinction, thus depriving future generations of an important food source and a means to make a living. This idea is known as sustainability. Environmentalists want to set strict fishing limits on a variety of species. Commercial fishers resist these limits, claiming they are unnecessary and, if enforced, would drive them out of business (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_OSC_AmGov_01_01_Fishing">Figure 1.4</a>). Currently, fishing limits are set by a combination of scientists, politicians, local resource managers, and groups representing the interests of fishers.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_rf-3"><sup class="os-citation-number">3</sup></a></p>

However, without government restrictions on the kinds and number of fish that can be caught, the fish population would decline and certain species could become extinct.

In the United States, people elect representatives to city councils, state legislatures, and Congress. These bodies make laws to govern their respective jurisdictions. They also pass measures to raise money, through the imposition of taxes on such things as income, property, and sales. Local, state, and national governments also draft budgets to determine how the revenue taken in will be spent for services. On the local level, funds are allotted for education, police and fire departments, and maintenance of public parks. State governments allocate money for state colleges and universities, maintenance of state roads and bridges, and wildlife management, among other priorities. On the national level, money goes to such things as defense, Social Security, pensions for veterans, maintenance of federal courts and prisons, and management of national parks. At each level, representatives elected by the people try to secure funding for things that will benefit those who live in the areas they represent. Once money has been allocated, government agencies at each level then receive funds for the purposes mentioned above and use them to provide services to the public.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171474338961">Local, state, and national governments also make laws to maintain order and to ensure the efficient functioning of society, including the fair operation of the business marketplace. In the United States, for example, Congress passes laws regulating banking, and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories, the purity of food offered for sale, and the safety of toys and automobiles. In this way, government checks the actions of business, something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="S" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term18">Smith</span> believed it should&#x2026;almost entirely unregulated.</p>

Western democracies like the United States, Britain, France, and others protect citizens&#x2019; freedom of speech and the press. These nations, and others in the world, also allow citizens to vote.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171474428306">As noted earlier, <span data-type="term" group-by="p" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term19">politics</span> is the process by which choices are made regarding how resources will be allocated and which economic and social policies government will pursue. Put more simply, politics is the process of who gets what and how. Politics involves choosing which values government will support and which it will not. If government chooses to support an ideal such as <span data-type="term" group-by="i" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term20">individualism</span>, it may choose to loosen regulations on business and industry or to cut taxes so that people have more money to invest in business. If it chooses to support an ideal such as <span data-type="term" group-by="e" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term21">egalitarianism</span>, which calls for equal treatment for all and the destruction of socioeconomic inequalities, it may raise taxes in order to be able to spend more on public education, public transportation, housing for the poor, and care for the elderly. If, for example, the government is more concerned with national security than with <span data-type="term" group-by="i" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term22">individual liberty</span>, it may authorize the tapping of people&#x2019;s phones and restrict what newspapers may publish. If liberty is more important, then government will place greater restrictions on the extent that law enforcement agencies can intrude upon citizens&#x2019; private communications. The political process and the input of citizens help determine the answer.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171474281328">Civic engagement, or the participation that connects citizens to government, is a vital ingredient of politics. In the United States, citizens play an important role in influencing what policies are pursued, what values the government chooses to support, what initiatives are granted funding, and who gets to make the final decisions. Political engagement can take many forms: reading about politics, listening to news reports, discussing politics, attending (or watching televised) political debates, donating money to political campaigns, handing out flyers promoting a candidate, voting, joining protest marches, and writing letters to their elected representatives.</p>

            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171474295462">The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which <span data-type="term" group-by="p" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term23">political power</span>&#x2014;influence over institutions, leaders, and policies&#x2014;rests in the hands of the people. In a <span data-type="term" group-by="r" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term24">representative democracy</span>, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor <span data-type="term" group-by="m" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term25">majority rule</span>: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it, the law will be enacted.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171472203536">However, in representative governments like the United States, <span data-type="term" group-by="m" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term26">minority rights</span> are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let&#x2019;s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_rf-4"><sup class="os-citation-number">4</sup></a> Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States.</p>
            <p id="auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_fs-id1171474327827">In a <span data-type="term" group-by="d" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term27">direct democracy</span>, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy&#x2014;the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government&#x2014;some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot for citizens to vote on directly during state or local elections instead of leaving the matter in the hands of the state legislature. At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_OSC_AmGov_01_01_Meeting">Figure 1.5</a>). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement.</p>

In a <span data-type="term" group-by="m" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term28">monarchy</span>, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party&#x2019;s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under <span data-type="term" group-by="t" id="auto_page_1105deb5-ddeb-4777-80cf-f844a0d1492b_term29">totalitarianism</span>, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens&#x2019; lives. Citizens&#x2019; rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government.</p>

The United States also has many different levels and branches of government that any citizen or group might approach. Many people take this as evidence that U.S. citizens, especially as represented by competing groups, are able to influence government actions. Some political theorists, however, argue that this is not the case. They claim that only a handful of economic and political elites have any influence over government.</p>

Pluralist theorists assume that citizens who want to get involved in the system do so because of the great number of access points to government.

According to elite theory, the wealthy use their power to control the nation&#x2019;s economy in such a way that those below them cannot advance economically. Their wealth allows the elite to secure for themselves important positions in politics. They then use this power to make decisions and allocate resources in ways that benefit them. Politicians do the bidding of the wealthy instead of attending to the needs of ordinary people, and order is maintained by force. Indeed, those who favor government by the elite believe the elite are better fit to govern and that average citizens are content to allow them to do so.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_rf-6"><sup class="os-citation-number">7</sup></a></p>

For example, changes in the way taxes are levied and spent do not affect all citizens equally. A flat tax, which generally requires that everyone pay the same percentage rate, hurts the poor more than it does the rich. If the income tax rate was flat at 10 percent, all Americans would have to pay 10 percent of their income to the federal government. Someone who made $40,000 a year would have to pay $4,000 and be left with only $36,000 to live on. Someone who made $1,000,000 would have to pay $100,000, a greater sum, but they would still be left with $900,000. People who were not wealthy would probably pay more than they could comfortably afford, while the wealthy, who could afford to pay more and still live well, would not see a real impact on their daily lives. Similarly, the allocation of revenue affects the rich and the poor differently. Giving more money to public education does not benefit the wealthy as much as it does the poor, because the wealthy are more likely than the poor to send their children to private schools or to at least have the option of doing so. However, better funded public schools have the potential to greatly improve the upward mobility of members of other socioeconomic classes who have no other option than to send their children to public schools.</p>
            <p id="auto_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_fs-id1171472222795">Currently, about half of the members of Congress are millionaires.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_rf-11"><sup class="os-citation-number">13</sup></a> As of 2009, approximately 38 percent of Congress sent their children to private schools.

These groups include such entities as environmental advocates, unions, and organizations that represent the interests of various businesses. Because most people lack the inclination, time, or expertise necessary to decide political issues, these groups will speak for them. As groups compete with one another and find themselves in conflict regarding important issues, government policy begins to take shape. In this way, government policy is shaped from the bottom up and not from the top down, as we see in elitist theory.

For instance, an action that will meet the needs of large numbers of people may not be favored by the elite members of society. Giving the elite what they want may interfere with plans to help the poor. As pluralists argue, public policy is created as a result of competition among groups. In the end, the interests of both the elite and the people likely influence government action, and compromises will often attempt to please them both.</p>
            <p id="auto_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_fs-id1171474256546">Since the framing of the U.S. Constitution, tradeoffs have been made between those who favor the supremacy of the central government and those who believe that state governments should be more powerful. With the rapid spread of COVID-19 in 2020, should the national government have been able able to mandate state and local actions on masks and social distancing in order to protect the public? Or, was the approach that played out, with state and local control of these measures, the way to go? Should those who control the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Agency (NSA) be allowed to eavesdrop on phone conversations of Americans and read their email? Should groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which protect all citizens&#x2019; rights to freedom of speech, be able to prevent this?</p>
            <p id="auto_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_fs-id1171474222198">Many of the tradeoffs made by government are about <span data-type="term" group-by="f" id="auto_page_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_term37">freedom of speech</span>.

Because of the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="F" id="auto_page_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_term39">Fourteenth Amendment</span>, state governments must protect this right also. At the same time, neither the federal government nor state governments can allow someone&#x2019;s right to free expression to interfere with someone else&#x2019;s ability to exercise their own rights. For example, in the United States, it is legal for women to have abortions. Many people oppose this right and often protest outside facilities that provide abortions. In 2007, the state of Massachusetts enacted a law that required protestors to stand thirty-five feet away from clinic entrances. The intention was to prevent women seeking abortions from being harassed or threatened with violence. Groups favoring the protection of women&#x2019;s reproductive rights supported the law. Groups opposed to abortion argued that the buffer zone prevented them from speaking to women to try to persuade them not to have the procedure done. In 2014, in the case of <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="M" id="auto_page_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_term40"><em data-effect="italics">McCullen v. Coakley</em></span>, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the law that created a buffer zone between protestors and clinic entrances.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_rf-16"><sup class="os-citation-number">18</sup></a> The federal government does not always side with those who oppose abortion, however. Several states have attempted to pass laws requiring women to notify their husbands, and often obtain their consent, before having an abortion. All such laws have been found unconstitutional by the courts.</p>
            <p id="auto_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_fs-id1171474311958">Tradeoffs also occur as a result of conflict between groups representing the competing interests of citizens. Many Americans believe that the U.S. must become less dependent on foreign sources of energy. Many also would like people to have access to inexpensive sources of energy. Such people are likely to support fracking: the process of hydraulic fracturing that gives drilling companies access to natural gas trapped between layers of shale underground. Fracking produces abundant, inexpensive natural gas, a great benefit to people who live in parts of the country where it is expensive to heat homes during the winter. Fracking also creates jobs. At the same time, many scholars argue that fracking can result in the contamination of drinking water, air pollution, and increased risk of earthquakes. One study has even linked fracking to cancer. Thus, those who want to provide jobs and inexpensive natural gas are in conflict with those who wish to protect the natural environment and human health (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_OSC_AmGov_01_02_Fracking">Figure 1.7</a>).

Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives usually vote according to the concerns of people who live in their districts. Not only does this often pit the interests of people in different parts of the country against one another, but it also frequently favors the interests of certain groups of people over the interests of others within the same state. For example, allowing oil companies to drill off the state&#x2019;s coast may please those who need the jobs that will be created, but it will anger those who wish to preserve coastal lands as a refuge for wildlife and, in the event of an accident, may harm the interests of people who depend on fishing and tourism for their living. At times, House members and senators in Congress may ignore the voters in their home states and the groups that represent them in order to follow the dictates of the leaders of the political party to which they belong. For example, a member of Congress from a state with a large elderly population may be inclined to vote in favor of legislation to increase benefits for retired people; however, the political party leaders, who disapprove of government spending on social programs, may ask for a vote against it. The opposite can occur as well, especially in the case of a legislator soon facing re-election. With two-year terms of office, we are more likely to see House members buck their party in favor of their constituents.</p>

After repeated incidents of mass shootings at schools, theaters, churches, concerts, night clubs, and shopping malls, many are concerned with protecting themselves and their families from firearm violence. Some groups would like to ban the sale of certain types of weapons completely. Some do not want to ban gun ownership; they merely want greater restrictions to be put in place on who can buy guns or how long people must wait between the time they enter the store to make a purchase and the time when they are actually given possession of the weapon. Others oppose any restrictions on the number or type of weapons Americans may own. So far, state governments have attempted to balance the interests of these groups by placing restrictions on such things as who can sell guns, where gun sales may take place, or requirements for background checks, but they have not attempted to ban gun sales altogether. For example, although federal law does not require private gun dealers (people who sell guns but do not derive most of their income from doing so) to conduct background checks before selling firearms to people at gun shows, some states have passed laws requiring this.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_rf-18"><sup class="os-citation-number">20</sup></a></p>
            <p id="auto_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_eip-366">At the federal level, there has been widespread support in Congress to improve the background checking process. Indeed, despite objections from the National Rifle Association, the Fix-NICS Act passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Trump as part of an omnibus spending bill in March 2018.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_gun"><sup class="os-citation-number">21</sup></a> And, in the wake of mass shootings in Atlanta and Boulder, at the time of this writing, there are two House-passed bills under consideration in the U.S. Senate.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_1df654ee-6899-49a8-a1a2-8a6f85610fa3_rf-19"><sup class="os-citation-number">22</sup></a></p>

Although people may not get all that they want, they can achieve many goals and improve their lives through civic engagement. According to the pluralist theory, government cannot function without active participation by at least some citizens. Even if we believe the elite make political decisions, participation in government through the act of voting can change who the members of the elite are.</p>

Political scientist Robert <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="P" id="auto_page_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_term41">Putnam</span> has argued that <span data-type="term" group-by="c" id="auto_page_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_term42">civic engagement</span> is declining; although many Americans may report belonging to groups, these groups are usually large, impersonal ones with thousands of members. People who join groups such as Amnesty International or Greenpeace may share certain values and ideals with other members of the group, but they do not actually interact with these other members. These organizations are different from the types of groups Americans used to belong to, like church groups or bowling leagues. Although people are still interested in volunteering and working for the public good, they are more interested in either working individually or joining large organizations where they have little opportunity to interact with others. Putnam considers a number of explanations for this decline in small group membership, including increased participation by women in the workforce, a decrease in the number of marriages and an increase in divorces, and the effect of technological developments, such as the internet, that separate people by allowing them to feel connected to others without having to spend time in their presence.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_rf-20"><sup class="os-citation-number">23</sup></a></p>

This, in turn, has hurt people&#x2019;s willingness and ability to engage in representative government. If Putnam is correct, this trend is unfortunate, because becoming active in government and community organizations is important for many reasons.</p>

Everett Ladd shows many positive trends in social involvement in American communities that serve to soften some of the declines identified by Putnam. For example, while bowling league participation is down, soccer league participation has proliferated.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_soccer-20"><sup class="os-citation-number">25</sup></a> April Clark examines and analyzes a wide variety of social capital data trends and disputes the original thesis of erosion.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_clark-20"><sup class="os-citation-number">26</sup></a>  Others have suggested that technology has increased connectedness, an idea that Putnam himself has critiqued as not as deep as in-person connections.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_badger-20"><sup class="os-citation-number">27</sup></a></p>

Even those without money or connections to important people can influence the policies that affect their lives and change the direction taken by government. U.S. history is filled with examples of people actively challenging the power of elites, gaining rights for themselves, and protecting their interests. For example, slavery was once legal in the United States and large sectors of the U.S. economy were dependent on this forced labor. Slavery was outlawed and enslaved people were granted citizenship because of the actions of abolitionists. Although some abolitionists were wealthy White men, most were ordinary people, including men and women of both races. White women and African Americans were able to actively assist in the campaign to end slavery despite the fact that, with few exceptions, they were unable to vote. Similarly, the right to vote once belonged solely to White men until the Fifteenth Amendment gave the vote to African American men. The Nineteenth Amendment extended the vote to include women, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made exercising the right to vote a reality for Black men and women in the South. None of this would have happened, however, without the efforts of people who marched in protest, participated in boycotts, delivered speeches, wrote letters to politicians, and sometimes risked arrest in order to be heard (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_OSC_AmGov_01_03_Amendment">Figure 1.8</a>). The tactics used to influence the government and effect change by abolitionists and members of the women&#x2019;s rights and African American civil rights movements are still used by many activists today.</p>

Civil rights legislation did not focus solely on the right to vote or to hold public office; it also integrated schools and public accommodations, prohibited discrimination in housing and employment, and increased access to higher education. Activists for <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="w" id="auto_page_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_term44">women&#x2019;s rights</span> fought for, and won, greater reproductive freedom for women, better wages, and access to credit. Only a few decades ago, homosexuality was considered a mental disorder, and intercourse between consenting adults of the same sex was illegal in many states. Although legal discrimination against LGBTQ people still remains, consensual intercourse between gay and lesbian adults is no longer illegal anywhere in the United States, same-sex couples have the right to legally marry, and LGBTQ people are better protected against employment discrimination.</p>
            <p id="auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_fs-id1171472058498">Activism can improve people&#x2019;s lives in less dramatic ways as well. Working to make cities clean up vacant lots, destroy or rehabilitate abandoned buildings, build more parks and playgrounds, pass ordinances requiring people to curb their dogs, and ban late-night noise greatly affects people&#x2019;s quality of life. The actions of individual Americans can make their own lives better and improve their neighbors&#x2019; lives as well.</p>
            <p id="auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_fs-id1171472079232">Representative democracy cannot work effectively without the participation of informed citizens, however. Engaged citizens familiarize themselves with the most important issues confronting the country and with the plans different candidates have for dealing with those issues. Then they vote for the candidates they believe will be best suited to the job, and they may join others to raise funds or campaign for those they support. They inform their representatives how they feel about important issues. Through these efforts and others, engaged citizens let their representatives know what they want and thus influence policy. Only then can government actions accurately reflect the interests and concerns of the majority. Even people who believe the elite rule government should recognize that it is easier for them to do so if ordinary people make no effort to participate in public life.</p>

Some forms of individual engagement require very little effort. One of the simplest ways is to stay informed about debates and events in the community, in the state, and in the nation. Awareness is the first step toward engagement. News is available from a variety of reputable sources, such as newspapers like the <em data-effect="italics">New York Times</em>; national news shows, including those offered by the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio; and reputable internet sites.</p>

Filing a complaint with the city council is another avenue of engagement. City officials cannot fix problems if they do not know anything is wrong to begin with. Responding to public opinion polls, actively contributing to a political blog, or starting a new blog are all examples of different ways to be involved. It is also inescapable that social media engagement has exploded over the last ten years. Moreover, with the self selection of friend groups and feeds online, bias is mobilized, and we see increasing complaints about fake news.</p>
            <p id="auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_fs-id1171471917574">One of the most basic ways to engage with government as an individual is to vote (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_OSC_AmGov_01_03_EarlyVote">Figure 1.9</a>). Individual votes do matter. City council members, mayors, state legislators, governors, and members of Congress are all chosen by popular vote. Although the president of the United States is not chosen directly by popular vote but by a group called the Electoral College, the votes of individuals in their home states determine how the Electoral College ultimately votes. Registering to vote beforehand is necessary in most states, but it is usually a simple process, and many states allow registration online. (We discuss voter registration and voter turnout in more depth in a later chapter.)</p>

Individuals can engage by attending political rallies, donating money to campaigns, and signing petitions. Starting a petition of one&#x2019;s own is relatively easy, and some websites that encourage people to become involved in political activism provide petitions that can be circulated through email. Taking part in a poll or survey is another simple way to make your voice heard.</p>

They may believe politicians are not interested in what they have to say, or they may feel their votes do not matter. However, this attitude has not always prevailed. Indeed, today&#x2019;s college students can vote because of the activism of college students in the 1960s. Most states at that time required citizens to be twenty-one years of age before they could vote in national elections. This angered many young people, especially young men who could be drafted to fight the war in Vietnam. They argued that it was unfair to deny eighteen-year-olds the right to vote for the people who had the power to send them to war. As a result, the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="T" id="auto_page_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_term45">Twenty-Sixth Amendment</span>, which lowered the voting age in national elections to eighteen, was ratified by the states and went into effect in 1971.</p>

Group activities can be as simple as hosting a book club or discussion group to talk about politics. Coffee Party USA provides an online forum for people from a variety of political perspectives to discuss issues that are of concern to them. People who wish to be more active often work for political campaigns. Engaging in fundraising efforts, handing out bumper stickers and campaign buttons, helping people register to vote, and driving voters to the polls on Election Day are all important activities that anyone can engage in. Individual citizens can also join interest groups that promote the causes they favor.</p>

The demands on government are great, and funds do not always exist to enable it to undertake all the projects it may deem necessary. Even when there are sufficient funds, politicians have differing ideas regarding how much government should do and what areas it should be active in. Volunteers and community organizations help fill the gaps. Examples of community action include tending a community garden, building a house for Habitat for Humanity, cleaning up trash in a vacant lot, volunteering to deliver meals to the elderly, and tutoring children in after-school programs (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_OSC_AmGov_01_03_Volunteer">Figure 1.10</a>).</p>

The mold in his family&#x2019;s public housing apartment caused him to have asthma as a child, and he spent time in the hospital on more than one occasion because of it. His mother&#x2019;s complaints to the New York City Housing Authority were largely ignored.

After graduation, he volunteered to campaign for Vacca in his run for a seat on the City Council. After Vacca was elected, he hired Torres to serve as his housing director to reach out to the community on Vacca&#x2019;s behalf. While doing so, Torres took pictures of the poor conditions in public housing and collected complaints from residents. In 2013, Torres ran for a seat on the City Council himself and won. In November 2020, Torres was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to represent New York's 15th congressional district. He and Mondaire Jones, who represents NY 17, are the first openly gay Black men elected to Congress.

A survey conducted in 2018 revealed that almost 70 percent of American adults had participated in some type of political action in the past five years. These activities included largely non-personal activities that did not require a great deal of interaction with others, such as signing petitions, expressing opinions on social media, contacting elected representatives, or contributing money to campaigns. During the same period, approximately 30 percent of people attended a local government meeting or a political rally or event, while 16 percent worked or volunteered for a campaign.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_rf-24"><sup class="os-citation-number">30</sup></a></p>

A 2018 poll of more than two thousand young adults by Harvard University&#x2019;s Institute of Politics revealed that only 24 percent claimed to be politically engaged, and fewer than 35 percent said that they had voted in a primary. Only 9 percent said that they had gone to a political demonstration, rally, or march.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_rf-25"><sup class="os-citation-number">31</sup></a> However, in the 2018 midterm elections, an estimated 31 percent of Americans under thirty turned out to vote, the highest level of young adult engagement in decades.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_rf-26"><sup class="os-citation-number">32</sup></a> In 2020, Harvard's polling showed significant interest in the 2020 presidential campaign and intent to vote. Post-election analysis by Tuft University's Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning &amp; Engagement (CIRCLE) showed a record youth turnout of 53 percent, which was greater even than the historic turnout in the 2008 contest. The young vote swung heavily toward Biden in swing states. And, yet, young voters again participated at lower rates than did other age groups.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_rf-27"><sup class="os-citation-number">33</sup></a></p>

One answer may be that as American politics become more partisan in nature, young people turn away. Committed <span data-type="term" group-by="p" id="auto_page_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_term53">partisanship</span>, which is the tendency to identify with and to support (often blindly) a particular political party, alienates some Americans who feel that elected representatives should vote in support of the nation&#x2019;s best interests instead of voting in the way their party wishes them to. When elected officials ignore all factors other than their party&#x2019;s position on a particular issue, some voters become disheartened while others may become polarized. However, a recent study reveals that it is a distrust of the opposing party and not an ideological commitment to their own party that is at the heart of most partisanship among voters.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_rf-28"><sup class="os-citation-number">34</sup></a></p>

Many Americans under the age of thirty now identify themselves as Independents instead of Democrats or Republicans (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_OSC_AmGov_01_03_Harvard15">Figure 1.13</a>). Instead of identifying with a particular political party, young Americans are increasingly concerned about specific issues, such as same-sex marriage.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_rf-29"><sup class="os-citation-number">35</sup></a> People whose votes are determined based on single issues are unlikely to vote according to party affiliation. </p>
            <p id="auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_eip-946">The other factor involved in low youth voter turnout in the past was that younger Americans did not feel that candidates generally tackle issues relevant to their lives. When younger voters cannot relate to the issues put forth in a campaign, such as entitlements for seniors, they lose interest. This dynamic changed somewhat in 2016 as Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders made college costs an issue, even promising free college tuition for undergraduates at public institutions. Senator Sanders enjoyed intense support on college campuses across the United States. After his nomination campaign failed, this young voter enthusiasm faded. Despite the fact that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton eventually took up the free tuition issue, young people did not flock to her as well as they had to Sanders. In the general election, won by Republican nominee Donald Trump, turnout was down and Clinton received a smaller proportion of the youth vote than President Obama had in 2012.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_rf-30"><sup class="os-citation-number">36</sup></a> In 2020, youth again felt connected with candidates, and that compelled participation throughout the election year. Sanders again galvanized interest, as did Biden and Harris during the general election phase. Student loan debt was a key campaign issue.</p>

This is especially true among the young. While ideological polarization has occurred on both sides of the political spectrum, as some members of the Republican Party have become more ideologically conservative (e.g., opposing same-sex marriage, legalization of certain drugs, immigration reform, gun control, separation of church and state, and access to abortion), those young people who do identify with one of the major parties have in recent years tended to favor the Democratic Party.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_rf-31"><sup class="os-citation-number">37</sup></a> Of the Americans under age thirty who were surveyed by Harvard in 2015, more tended to hold a favorable opinion of Democrats in Congress than of Republicans, and  in the 2020 election, 61 percent of younger voters voted for the Democratic ticket (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_OSC_AmGov_01_03_Harvard15">Figure 1.13</a>). Even those young Americans who identify themselves as Republicans are more liberal on certain issues, such as being supportive of same-sex marriage and immigration reform, than are older Republicans. The young Republicans also may be more willing to see similarities between themselves and Democrats.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_rf-32"><sup class="os-citation-number">38</sup></a> Once again, support for the views of a particular party does not necessarily mean that someone will vote for members of that party.</p>

Unfortunately, public opinion polls, which politicians may rely on when formulating policy or deciding how to vote on issues, capture only people&#x2019;s <span data-type="term" group-by="l" id="auto_page_3cde8682-1626-42e6-902d-d6f01e4cc538_term55">latent preferences</span> or beliefs. Latent preferences are not deeply held and do not remain the same over time. They may not even represent a person&#x2019;s true feelings, since they may be formed on the spot when someone is asked a question about which they have no real opinion. Indeed, voting itself may reflect merely a latent preference because even people who do not feel strongly about a particular political candidate or issue vote.

It also regulates access to common goods, such as public land, for the benefit of all. Government creates a structure whereby people can make their needs and opinions known to public officials. This is one of the key factors that makes the United States a representative democracy. A country where people elect representatives to make political decisions for them depends on the ability and willingness of ordinary people to make their voices known, unlike an oligarchy dominated by only a small group of people.</p>

Those who support the elite theory of government argue that a small, wealthy, powerful elite controls government and makes policy to benefit its members and perpetuate their power. Others favor the pluralist theory, which maintains that groups representing the people&#x2019;s interests do attract the attention of politicians and can influence government policy. In reality, government policy usually is the result of a series of tradeoffs as groups and elites fight with one another for influence and politicians attempt to balance the demands of competing interests, including the interests of the constituents who elected them to office.</p>

It also improves people&#x2019;s lives and helps them to build connections with others. Individuals can educate themselves on important issues and events, write to their senator or representative, file a complaint at city hall, attend a political rally, or vote. People can also work in groups to campaign or raise funds for a candidate, volunteer in the community, or protest a social injustice or an unpopular government policy. Although wealthier, older, more highly educated citizens are the most likely to be engaged with their government, especially if they have intense preferences about an issue, younger, less wealthy people can do much to change their communities and their country.</p>

It is also the oldest, and shortest, written constitutions of the modern era still in existence. Its writing was by no means inevitable, however. In many ways, the Constitution was both the culmination of American (and British) political thought about government power and a blueprint for the future.</p>
              <p id="auto_0acb62c3-5ee2-4202-a325-96983c7015d9_fs-id1166227389572">It is tempting to think of the framers of the Constitution as a group of like-minded men aligned in their lofty thinking regarding rights and freedoms. This assumption makes it hard to oppose constitutional principles in modern-day politics because people admire the longevity of the Constitution and like to consider its ideals above petty <span data-type="term" group-by="p" id="auto_page_0acb62c3-5ee2-4202-a325-96983c7015d9_term57">partisan politics</span>. However, the Constitution was designed largely out of necessity following the failure of the first revolutionary government, and it featured a series of pragmatic compromises among its disparate stakeholders. It is therefore quite appropriate that more than 225 years later the U.S. government still requires compromise to function properly.</p>
              <p id="auto_0acb62c3-5ee2-4202-a325-96983c7015d9_fs-id1166227589891">How did the Constitution come to be written? What compromises were needed to ensure the ratification that made it into law? This chapter addresses these questions and also describes why the Constitution remains a living, changing document.</p>

The varied strands of what became the American republic had many roots, reaching far back in time and across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. Indeed, it was not new ideas but old ones that led the colonists to revolt and form a new nation.</p>

            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226288620">Locke was not the first Englishman to suggest that people had rights. The British government had recognized its duty to protect the lives, liberties, and property of English citizens long before the settling of its North American colonies. In 1215, King John signed <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="M" id="auto_page_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_term60">Magna Carta</span>&#x2014;a promise to his subjects that he and future monarchs would refrain from certain actions that harmed, or had the potential to harm, the people of England. Prominent in Magna Carta&#x2019;s many provisions are protections for life, liberty, and property. For example, one of the document&#x2019;s most famous clauses promises, &#x201C;No freemen shall be taken, imprisoned . . . or in any way destroyed . . . except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.&#x201D; Although it took a long time for modern ideas regarding due process to form, this clause lays the foundation for the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. While Magna Carta was intended to grant protections only to the English barons who were in revolt against King John in 1215, by the time of the American Revolution, English subjects, both in England and in North America, had come to regard the document as a cornerstone of liberty for men of all stations&#x2014;a right that had been recognized by King John I in 1215, but the people had actually possessed long before then.</p>
            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226323693">The rights protected by Magna Carta had been granted by the king, and, in theory, a future king or queen could take them away. The natural rights Locke described, however, had been granted by God and thus could never be abolished by human beings, even royal ones, or by the institutions they created.</p>
            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226382136">So committed were the British to the protection of these natural rights that when the royal Stuart dynasty began to intrude upon them in the seventeenth century, Parliament removed King James II, already disliked because he was Roman Catholic, in the Glorious Revolution and invited his Protestant daughter and her husband to rule the nation. Before offering the throne to William and Mary, however, Parliament passed the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="E" id="auto_page_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_term61">English Bill of Rights</span> in 1689. A bill of rights is a list of the liberties and protections possessed by a nation&#x2019;s citizens. The English Bill of Rights, heavily influenced by Locke&#x2019;s ideas, enumerated the rights of English citizens and explicitly guaranteed rights to life, liberty, and property. This document would profoundly influence the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.</p>
            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226338990">American colonists also shared Locke&#x2019;s concept of property rights. According to Locke, anyone who invested labor in the <em data-effect="italics">commons</em>&#x2014;the land, forests, water, animals, and other parts of nature that were free for the taking&#x2014;might take as much of these as needed, by cutting trees, for example, or building a fence around a field. The only restriction was that no one could take so much that others were deprived of their right to take from the commons as well. In the colonists&#x2019; eyes, all free White males should have the right to acquire property, and once it had been acquired, government had the duty to protect it. (The rights of women remained greatly limited for many more years.)</p>
            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226317034">Perhaps the most important of Locke&#x2019;s ideas that influenced the British settlers of North America were those regarding the origins and purpose of government. Most Europeans of the time believed the institution of monarchy had been created by God, and kings and queens had been divinely appointed to rule. Locke, however, theorized that human beings, not God, had created government. People sacrificed a small portion of their freedom and consented to be ruled in exchange for the government&#x2019;s protection of their lives, liberty, and property. Locke called this implicit agreement between a people and their government the <span data-type="term" group-by="s" id="auto_page_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_term62">social contract</span>. Should government deprive people of their rights by abusing the power given to it, the contract was broken and the people were no longer bound by its terms. The people could thus withdraw their consent to obey and form another government for their protection.</p>
            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226379984">The belief that government should not deprive people of their liberties and should be restricted in its power over citizens&#x2019; lives was an important factor in the controversial decision by the American colonies to declare independence from England in 1776. For Locke, withdrawing consent to be ruled by an established government and forming a new one meant replacing one monarch with another. For those colonists intent on rebelling, however, it meant establishing a new nation and creating a new government, one that would be greatly limited in the power it could exercise over the people.</p>
            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226377940">The desire to limit the power of government is closely related to the belief that people should govern themselves. This core tenet of American political thought was rooted in a variety of traditions. First, the British government did allow for a degree of self-government. Laws were made by Parliament, and property-owning males were allowed to vote for representatives to Parliament. Thus, Americans were accustomed to the idea of <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="r" id="auto_page_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_term63">representative government</span> from the beginning. For instance, Virginia established its House of Burgesses in 1619. Upon their arrival in North America a year later, the English Separatists who settled the Plymouth Colony, commonly known as the Pilgrims, promptly authored the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="M" id="auto_page_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_term64">Mayflower Compact</span>, an agreement to govern themselves according to the laws created by the male voters of the colony.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_rf-1234"><sup class="os-citation-number">1</sup></a> By the eighteenth century, all the colonies had established legislatures to which men were elected to make the laws for their fellow colonists. When American colonists felt that this longstanding tradition of representative self-government was threatened by the actions of Parliament and the King, the American Revolution began.</p>

            <h3 data-type="title">THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION</h3>
            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226309278">The American Revolution began when a small and vocal group of colonists became convinced the king and Parliament were abusing them and depriving them of their rights. By 1776, they had been living under the rule of the British government for more than a century, and England had long treated the thirteen colonies with a degree of benign neglect. Each colony had established its own legislature. Taxes imposed by England were low, and property ownership was more widespread than in England. People readily proclaimed their loyalty to the king. For the most part, American colonists were proud to be British citizens and had no desire to form an independent nation.</p>
            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226359233">All this began to change in 1763 when the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="S" id="auto_page_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_term65">Seven Years War</span> between Great Britain and France came to an end, and Great Britain gained control of most of the French territory in North America. The colonists had fought on behalf of Britain, and many colonists expected that after the war they would be allowed to settle on land west of the Appalachian Mountains that had been taken from France. However, their hopes were not realized. Hoping to prevent conflict with Indian tribes in the Ohio Valley, Parliament passed the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="P" id="auto_page_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_term66">Proclamation of 1763</span>, which forbade the colonists to purchase land or settle west of the Appalachian Mountains.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_rf-12341"><sup class="os-citation-number">2</sup></a></p>

Among the acts passed by Parliament were laws requiring American colonists to pay British merchants with gold and silver instead of paper currency and a mandate that suspected smugglers be tried in vice-admiralty courts, without jury trials. What angered the colonists most of all, however, was the imposition of direct taxes: taxes imposed on individuals instead of on transactions.</p>
            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226335923">Because the colonists had not consented to direct taxation, their primary objection was that it reduced their status as free men. The right of the people or their representatives to consent to taxation was enshrined in both Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights. Taxes were imposed by the House of Commons, one of the two houses of the British Parliament. The North American colonists, however, were not allowed to elect representatives to that body. In their eyes, taxation by representatives they had not voted for was a denial of their rights. Members of the House of Commons and people living in England had difficulty understanding this argument. All British subjects had to obey the laws passed by Parliament, including the requirement to pay taxes. Those who were not allowed to vote, such as women and Black people, were considered to have virtual representation in the British legislature; representatives elected by those who could vote made laws on behalf of those who could not. Many colonists, however, maintained that anything except direct representation was a violation of their rights as English subjects.</p>
            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226387796">The first such tax to draw the ire of colonists was the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="S" id="auto_page_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_term67">Stamp Act</span>, passed in 1765, which required that almost all paper goods, such as diplomas, land deeds, contracts, and newspapers, have revenue stamps placed on them. The outcry was so great that the new tax was quickly withdrawn, but its repeal was soon followed by a series of other tax acts, such as the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="T" id="auto_page_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_term68">Townshend Acts</span> (1767), which imposed taxes on many everyday objects such as glass, tea, and paint.</p>
            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226318584">The taxes imposed by the Townshend Acts were as poorly received by the colonists as the Stamp Act had been. The Massachusetts legislature sent a petition to the king asking for relief from the taxes and requested that other colonies join in a boycott of British manufactured goods. British officials threatened to suspend the legislatures of colonies that engaged in a boycott and, in response to a request for help from Boston&#x2019;s customs collector, sent a warship to the city in 1768. A few months later, British troops arrived, and on the evening of March 5, 1770, an altercation erupted outside the customs house. Shots rang out as the soldiers fired into the crowd (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_OSC_AmGov_02_01_BoMassacre">Figure 2.3</a>). Several people were hit; three died immediately. Britain had taxed the colonists without their consent. Now, British soldiers had taken colonists&#x2019; lives.</p>

In it, Jefferson eloquently laid out the reasons for rebellion. God, he wrote, had given everyone the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. People had created governments to protect these rights and consented to be governed by them so long as government functioned as intended. However, &#x201C;whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.&#x201D; Britain had deprived the colonists of their rights. The king had &#x201C;establish[ed] . . . an absolute Tyranny over these States.&#x201D; Just as their English forebears had removed King James II from the throne in 1689, the colonists now wished to establish a new rule.</p>

The king, Jefferson charged, had taxed the colonists without the consent of their elected representatives, interfered with their trade, denied them the right to trial by jury, and deprived them of their right to self-government. Such intrusions on their rights could not be tolerated. With their signing of the Declaration of Independence (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_OSC_AmGov_02_01_Signing">Figure 2.5</a>), the founders of the United States committed themselves to the creation of a new kind of government.</p>

Gaining recognition and aid from foreign nations would also be easier if the new United States had a national government able to borrow money and negotiate treaties. Accordingly, the Second Continental Congress called upon its delegates to create a new government strong enough to win the country&#x2019;s independence but not so powerful that it would deprive people of the very liberties for which they were fighting.</p>

It would not become the law of the land until all thirteen states had approved it. Within two years, all except Maryland had done so. Maryland argued that all territory west of the Appalachians, to which some states had laid claim, should instead be held by the national government as public land for the benefit of all the states. When the last of these states, Virginia, relinquished its land claims in early 1781, Maryland approved the Articles.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_b1c8c9e2-5571-4d8e-85db-0a3d6d9cb17b_rf-1243"><sup class="os-citation-number">4</sup></a> A few months later, the British surrendered.</p>

Each state had a governor and an elected legislature. In the new nation, the states remained free to govern their residents as they wished. The central government had authority to act in only a few areas, such as national defense, in which the states were assumed to have a common interest (and would, indeed, have to supply militias). This arrangement was meant to prevent the national government from becoming too powerful or abusing the rights of individual citizens. In the careful balance between power for the national government and liberty for the states, the Articles of Confederation favored the states.</p>

Each state legislature appointed delegates to the Congress; these men could be recalled at any time. Regardless of its size or the number of delegates it chose to send, each state would have only one vote. Delegates could serve for no more than three consecutive years, lest a class of elite professional politicians develop. The nation would have no independent chief executive or judiciary. Nine votes were required before the central government could act, and the Articles of Confederation could be changed only by unanimous approval of all thirteen states.</p>

            <h3 data-type="title">WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THE ARTICLES?</h3>
            <p id="auto_b1c8c9e2-5571-4d8e-85db-0a3d6d9cb17b_fs-id1166226361852">The Articles of Confederation satisfied the desire of those in the new nation who wanted a weak central government with limited power. Ironically, however, their very success led to their undoing. It soon became apparent that, while they protected the sovereignty of the states, the Articles had created a central government too weak to function effectively.</p>
            <p id="auto_b1c8c9e2-5571-4d8e-85db-0a3d6d9cb17b_fs-id1166226331298">One of the biggest problems was that the national government had no power to impose <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="t" id="auto_page_b1c8c9e2-5571-4d8e-85db-0a3d6d9cb17b_term84">taxes</span>. To avoid any perception of &#x201C;taxation without representation,&#x201D; the Articles of Confederation allowed only state governments to levy taxes. To pay for its expenses, the national government had to request money from the states, which were required to provide funds in proportion to the value of the land within their borders. The states, however, were often negligent in this duty, and the national government was underfunded. Without money, it could not pay debts owed from the Revolution and had trouble conducting foreign affairs. For example, the inability of the U.S. government to raise sufficient funds to compensate colonists who had remained loyal to Great Britain for their property losses during and after the American Revolution was one of the reasons the British refused to evacuate the land west of the Appalachians. The new nation was also unable to protect American ships from attacks by the Barbary pirates.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_b1c8c9e2-5571-4d8e-85db-0a3d6d9cb17b_rf-12344"><sup class="os-citation-number">5</sup></a> Foreign governments were also, understandably, reluctant to loan money to a nation that might never repay it because it lacked the ability to tax its citizens.</p>
            <p id="auto_b1c8c9e2-5571-4d8e-85db-0a3d6d9cb17b_fs-id1166226309225">The fiscal problems of the central government meant that the currency it issued, called the Continental, was largely worthless and people were reluctant to use it. Furthermore, while the Articles of Confederation had given the national government the power to coin money, they had not prohibited the states from doing so as well. As a result, numerous state banks issued their own banknotes, which had the same problems as the Continental. People who were unfamiliar with the reputation of the banks that had issued the banknotes often refused to accept them as currency. This reluctance, together with the overwhelming debts of the states, crippled the young nation&#x2019;s economy.</p>
            <p id="auto_b1c8c9e2-5571-4d8e-85db-0a3d6d9cb17b_fs-id1166226342462">The country&#x2019;s economic woes were made worse by the fact that the central government also lacked the power to impose tariffs on foreign imports or regulate interstate commerce. Thus, it was unable to prevent British merchants from flooding the U.S. market with low-priced goods after the Revolution, and American producers suffered from the competition. Compounding the problem, states often imposed tariffs on items produced by other states and otherwise interfered with their neighbors&#x2019; trade.</p>
            <p id="auto_b1c8c9e2-5571-4d8e-85db-0a3d6d9cb17b_fs-id1166226445916">The national government also lacked the power to raise an army or navy. Fears of a standing army in the employ of a tyrannical government had led the writers of the Articles of Confederation to leave defense largely to the states. Although the central government could declare war and agree to peace, it had to depend upon the states to provide soldiers. If state governors chose not to honor the national government&#x2019;s request, the country would lack an adequate defense. This was quite dangerous at a time when England and Spain still controlled large portions of North America (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_b1c8c9e2-5571-4d8e-85db-0a3d6d9cb17b_fs-id1166226365354">Table 2.1</a>).</p>

They owed taxes that had gone unpaid while they were away fighting the British during the Revolution. The Continental Congress had promised to pay them for their service, but the national government did not have sufficient money. Moreover, the farmers were unable to meet the onerous new tax burden Massachusetts imposed in order to pay its own debts from the Revolution.</p>
              <p id="auto_b1c8c9e2-5571-4d8e-85db-0a3d6d9cb17b_fs-id1166226318505">Led by Daniel Shays (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_b1c8c9e2-5571-4d8e-85db-0a3d6d9cb17b_OSC_AmGov_02_02_ShaysRebel">Figure 2.6</a>), the heavily indebted farmers marched to a local courthouse demanding relief. Faced with the refusal of many Massachusetts militiamen to arrest the rebels, with whom they sympathized, Governor James Bowdoin called upon the national government for aid, but none was available. The uprising was finally brought to an end the following year by a privately funded militia after the protestors&#x2019; unsuccessful attempt to raid the Springfield Armory.</p>

However, only five states sent representatives. Because all thirteen states had to agree to any alteration of the Articles, the convention in Annapolis could not accomplish its goal. Two of the delegates, Alexander <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="H" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term88">Hamilton</span> and James <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="M" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term89">Madison</span>, requested that all states send delegates to a convention in Philadelphia the following year to attempt once again to revise the Articles of Confederation. All the states except Rhode Island chose delegates to send to the meeting, a total of seventy men in all, but many did not attend. Among those not in attendance were John <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="A" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term90">Adams</span> and Thomas <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="J" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term91">Jefferson</span>, both of whom were overseas representing the country as diplomats.

Many wanted to strengthen the role and authority of the national government but feared creating a central government that was too powerful. They wished to preserve state autonomy, although not to a degree that prevented the states from working together collectively or made them entirely independent of the will of the national government. While seeking to protect the rights of individuals from government abuse, they nevertheless wished to create a society in which concerns for law and order did not give way in the face of demands for individual liberty. They wished to give political rights to all free men but also feared mob rule, which many felt would have been the result of Shays&#x2019; Rebellion had it succeeded. Delegates from small states did not want their interests pushed aside by delegations from more populous states like Virginia. And everyone was concerned about slavery. Representatives from southern states worried that delegates from states where it had been or was being abolished might try to outlaw the institution. Those who favored a nation free of the influence of slavery feared that southerners might attempt to make it a permanent part of American society. The only decision that all could agree on was the election of George <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="W" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term93">Washington</span>, the former commander of the Continental Army and hero of the American Revolution, as the president of the convention.</p>

When discussing the structure of the government under the new constitution, the delegates from Virginia called for a <span data-type="term" group-by="b" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term94">bicameral legislature</span> consisting of two houses. The number of a state&#x2019;s representatives in each house was to be based on the state&#x2019;s population. In each state, representatives in the lower house would be elected by popular vote. These representatives would then select their state&#x2019;s representatives in the upper house from among candidates proposed by the state&#x2019;s legislature. Once a representative&#x2019;s term in the legislature had ended, the representative could not be reelected until an unspecified amount of time had passed.</p>

Following the Revolution, some of the northern states had either abolished <span data-type="term" group-by="s" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term98">slavery</span> or instituted plans by which enslaved men and women would gradually be emancipated. Pennsylvania, for example, had passed the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="A" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term99">Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery</span> in 1780. All people born in the state to enslaved mothers after the law&#x2019;s passage would become indentured servants to be set free at age twenty-eight. In 1783, Massachusetts had freed all enslaved people within the state. Many Americans believed slavery was opposed to the ideals stated in the Declaration of Independence. Others felt it was inconsistent with the teachings of Christianity. Some White people feared for their safety if the enslaved population or Americans' reliance on slavery were to increase. Although some southerners shared similar sentiments, none of the southern states had abolished slavery and none wanted the Constitution to interfere with the institution. In addition to supporting the agriculture of the South, enslaved people could be taxed as property and counted as population for purposes of a state&#x2019;s representation in the government.</p>

              <h4 data-type="title">Federal Supremacy vs. State Sovereignty</h4>
              <p id="auto_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_fs-id1166227355748">Perhaps the greatest division among the states split those who favored a strong national government and those who favored limiting its powers and allowing states to govern themselves in most matters. Supporters of a strong central government argued that it was necessary for the survival and efficient functioning of the new nation. Without the authority to maintain and command an army and navy, the nation could not defend itself at a time when European powers still maintained formidable empires in North America. Without the power to tax and regulate trade, the government would not have enough money to maintain the nation&#x2019;s defense, protect American farmers and manufacturers from foreign competition, create the infrastructure necessary for interstate commerce and communications, maintain foreign embassies, or pay federal judges and other government officials. Furthermore, other countries would be reluctant to loan money to the United States if the federal government lacked the ability to impose taxes in order to repay its debts. Besides giving more power to populous states, the Virginia Plan also favored a strong national government that would legislate for the states in many areas and would have the power to veto laws passed by state legislatures.</p>
              <p id="auto_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_fs-id1166227483175">Others, however, feared that a strong national government might become too powerful and use its authority to oppress citizens and deprive them of their rights. They advocated a central government with sufficient authority to defend the nation but insisted that other powers be left to the states, which were believed to be better able to understand and protect the needs and interests of their residents. Such delegates approved the approach of the New Jersey Plan, which retained the unicameral Congress that had existed under the Articles of Confederation. It gave additional power to the national government, such as the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce and to compel states to comply with laws passed by Congress. However, states still retained a lot of power, including power over the national government. Congress, for example, could not impose taxes without the consent of the states. Furthermore, the nation&#x2019;s chief executive, appointed by the Congress, could be removed by Congress if state governors demanded it.</p>

They wanted and expected their new government to guarantee the rights of life, liberty, and property. Others believed it was more important for the national government to maintain order, and this might require it to limit personal liberty at times. All Americans, however, desired that the government not intrude upon people&#x2019;s rights to life, liberty, and property without reason.</p>

The document they created, the U.S. Constitution, was an ingenious instrument that allayed fears of a too-powerful central government and solved the problems that had beleaguered the national government under the Articles of Confederation. For the most part, it also resolved the conflicts between small and large states, northern and southern states, and those who favored a strong federal government and those who argued for state sovereignty.</p>

The first three articles divide the national government into three branches&#x2014;Congress, the executive branch, and the federal judiciary&#x2014;and describe the powers and responsibilities of each. In Article I, ten sections describe the structure of <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="C" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term102">Congress</span>, the basis for representation and the requirements for serving in Congress, the length of Congressional terms, and the powers of Congress.

Congress, it was decided, would consist of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state, regardless of size, would have two senators, making for equal representation as in the New Jersey Plan. Representation in the House would be based on population. Senators were to be appointed by state legislatures, a variation on the Virginia Plan. Members of the House of Representatives would be popularly elected by the voters in each state. Elected members of the House would be limited to two years in office before having to seek reelection, and those appointed to the Senate by each state&#x2019;s political elite would serve a term of six years.</p>

Congress had authority that the national government lacked under the Articles of Confederation. It could also coin and borrow money, grant patents and copyrights, declare war, and establish laws regulating naturalization and bankruptcy. While legislation could be proposed by either chamber of Congress, it had to pass both chambers by a majority vote before being sent to the president to be signed into law, and all bills to raise revenue had to begin in the House of Representatives. Only those men elected by the voters to represent them could impose taxes upon them. There would be no more taxation without representation.</p>

When states took a census of their population for the purpose of allotting House representatives, should enslaved people be counted? Southern states were adamant that they should be, while delegates from northern states were vehemently opposed, arguing that representatives from southern states could not represent the interests of those enslaved. If enslaved people were not counted, however, southern states would have far fewer representatives in the House than northern states did. For example, if South Carolina were allotted representatives based solely on its free population, it would receive only half the number it would have received if enslaved people, who made up approximately 43 percent of the population, were included.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_rf-12346"><sup class="os-citation-number">7</sup></a></p>

For purposes of Congressional apportionment, slaveholding states were allowed to count all their free population, including free African Americans and 60 percent (three-fifths) of their enslaved population. To mollify the north, the compromise also allowed counting 60 percent of a state&#x2019;s enslaved population for federal taxation, although no such taxes were ever collected. Another compromise regarding the institution of <span data-type="term" group-by="s" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term105">slavery</span> granted Congress the right to impose taxes on imports in exchange for a twenty-year prohibition on laws attempting to ban the importation of enslaved people to the United States, which would hurt the economy of southern states more than that of northern states. Because the southern states, especially South Carolina, had made it clear they would leave the convention if abolition were attempted, no serious effort was made by the framers to abolish slavery in the new nation, even though many delegates disapproved of the institution.</p>

Neither of these branches had existed under the Articles of Confederation. Thus, Congress can pass laws, but its power to do so can be checked by the president, who can <span data-type="term" group-by="v" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term108">veto</span> potential legislation so that it cannot become a law. Later, in the 1803 case of <em data-effect="italics">Marbury</em> v. <em data-effect="italics">Madison</em>, the U.S. Supreme Court established its own authority to rule on the constitutionality of laws, a process called judicial review.</p>

Should the president veto a bill passed by both houses of Congress, the bill is returned to Congress to be voted on again. If the bill passes both the House of Representatives and the Senate with a two-thirds vote in its favor, it becomes law even though the president has refused to sign it.</p>

To date, the Congress has never refused a president&#x2019;s request for a declaration of war. The president must also seek the advice and consent of the Senate before appointing members of the Supreme Court and ambassadors, and the Senate must approve the ratification of all treaties signed by the president. Congress may even remove the president from office. To do this, both chambers of Congress must work together. The House of Representatives impeaches the president by bringing formal charges against the president, and the Senate tries the case in a proceeding overseen by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The president is removed from office if found guilty.</p>

In a <span data-type="term" group-by="f" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term109">federal system</span>, power is divided between the federal (or national) government and the state governments. Great or explicit powers, called <span data-type="term" group-by="e" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term110">enumerated powers</span>, were granted to the federal government to declare war, impose taxes, coin and regulate currency, regulate foreign and interstate commerce, raise and maintain an army and a navy, maintain a post office, make treaties with foreign nations and with Native American tribes, and make laws regulating the naturalization of immigrants.</p>
            <p id="auto_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_fs-id1166227570915">All powers not expressly given to the national government, however, were intended to be exercised by the states. These powers are known as <span data-type="term" group-by="r" id="auto_page_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_term111">reserved powers</span> (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_OSC_AmGov_02_03_FedvsState">Figure 2.10</a>). Thus, states remained free to pass laws regarding such things as intrastate commerce (commerce within the borders of a state) and marriage. Some powers, such as the right to levy taxes, were given to both the state and federal governments. Both the states and the federal government have a chief executive to enforce the laws (a governor and the president, respectively) and a system of courts.</p>

Furthermore, although the federal government was to be limited to those powers enumerated in the Constitution, Article I provided for the expansion of Congressional powers if needed. The &#x201C;necessary and proper&#x201D; clause of Article I provides that Congress may &#x201C;make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing [enumerated] Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.&#x201D;</p>

Some did not support it, but the majority did. Before it could become the law of the land, however, the Constitution faced another hurdle. It had to be ratified by the states.</p>
          <section data-depth="1" id="auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_fs-id1166227483291">
            <h3 data-type="title">THE RATIFICATION PROCESS</h3>
            <p id="auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_fs-id1166227420181">Article VII, the final article of the Constitution, required that before the Constitution could become law and a new government could form, the document had to be ratified by nine of the thirteen states. Eleven days after the delegates at the Philadelphia convention approved it, copies of the Constitution were sent to each of the states, which were to hold ratifying conventions to either accept or reject it.</p>
            <p id="auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_fs-id1166227595186">This approach to <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="r" id="auto_page_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_term114">ratification</span> was an unusual one. Since the authority inherent in the Articles of Confederation and the Confederation Congress had rested on the consent of the states, changes to the nation&#x2019;s government should also have been ratified by the state legislatures. Instead, by calling upon state legislatures to hold ratification conventions to approve the Constitution, the framers avoided asking the legislators to approve a document that would require them to give up a degree of their own power. The men attending the ratification conventions would be delegates elected by their neighbors to represent their interests. They were not being asked to relinquish their power; in fact, they were being asked to place limits upon the power of their state legislators, whom they may not have elected in the first place. Finally, because the new nation was to be a republic in which power was held by the people through their elected representatives, it was considered appropriate to leave the ultimate acceptance or rejection of the Constitution to the nation&#x2019;s citizens. If convention delegates, who were chosen by popular vote, approved it, then the new government could rightly claim that it ruled with the consent of the people.</p>
            <p id="auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_fs-id1166227718005">The greatest sticking point when it came to ratification, as it had been at the Constitutional Convention itself, was the relative power of the state and federal governments. The framers of the Constitution believed that without the ability to maintain and command an army and navy, impose taxes, and force the states to comply with laws passed by Congress, the young nation would not survive for very long. But many people resisted increasing the powers of the national government at the expense of the states. Virginia&#x2019;s Patrick <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="H" id="auto_page_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_term115">Henry</span>, for example, feared that the newly created office of president would place excessive power in the hands of one man. He also disapproved of the federal government&#x2019;s new ability to tax its citizens. This right, Henry believed, should remain with the states.</p>
            <p id="auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_fs-id1166227476074">Other delegates, such as Edmund <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="R" id="auto_page_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_term116">Randolph</span> of Virginia, disapproved of the Constitution because it created a new federal judicial system. Their fear was that the federal courts would be too far away from where those who were tried lived. State courts were located closer to the homes of both plaintiffs and defendants, and it was believed that judges and juries in state courts could better understand the actions of those who appeared before them. In response to these fears, the federal government created federal courts in each of the states as well as in Maine, which was then part of Massachusetts, and Kentucky, which was part of Virginia.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_rf-123410"><sup class="os-citation-number">11</sup></a></p>

State governments had given jury trials to residents charged with violating the law and allowed their residents to possess weapons for their protection. Some had practiced religious tolerance as well. The Constitution, however, did not contain reassurances that the federal government would do so. Although it provided for habeas corpus and prohibited both a religious test for holding office and granting noble titles, some citizens feared the loss of their traditional rights and the violation of their liberties. This led many of the Constitution&#x2019;s opponents to call for a bill of rights and the refusal to ratify the document without one. The lack of a bill of rights was especially problematic in Virginia, as the Virginia Declaration of Rights was the most extensive rights-granting document among the states. The promise that a bill of rights would be drafted for the Constitution persuaded delegates in many states to support ratification.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_rf-123411"><sup class="os-citation-number">12</sup></a></p>

In the following excerpt (reproduced as written) from a letter dated March 15, 1789, after the Constitution had been ratified by nine states but before it had been approved by all thirteen, Jefferson reiterates his previously expressed concerns that a bill of rights to protect citizens&#x2019; freedoms was necessary and should be added to the Constitution:</p>
                <blockquote class="block" id="auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_fs-id1166227682186">

I am happy to find that on the whole you are a friend to this amendment. The Declaration of rights is like all other human blessings alloyed with some inconveniences, and not accomplishing fully it&#x2019;s object. But the good in this instance vastly overweighs the evil. . . . This instrument [the Constitution] forms us into one state as to certain objects, and gives us a legislative &amp; executive body for these objects. It should therefore guard us against their abuses of power. . . . Experience proves the inefficacy of a bill of rights. True. But tho it is not absolutely efficacious under all circumstances, it is of great potency always, and rarely inefficacious. . . . There is a remarkeable difference between the . . . Inconveniences which attend a Declaration of rights, &amp; those which attend the want of it. . . .

Equal representation in the Senate would give them a degree of equality with the larger states, and a strong national government with an army at its command would be better able to defend them than their state militias could. Larger states, however, had significant power to lose. They did not believe they needed the federal government to defend them and disliked the prospect of having to provide tax money to support the new government. Thus, from the very beginning, the supporters of the Constitution feared that New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia would refuse to ratify it. That would mean all nine of the remaining states would have to, and Rhode Island, the smallest state, was unlikely to do so. It had not even sent delegates to the convention in Philadelphia. And even if it joined the other states in ratifying the document and the requisite nine votes were cast, the new nation would not be secure without its largest, wealthiest, and most populous states as members of the union.</p>

            <p id="auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_fs-id1166227427906">On the question of ratification, citizens quickly separated into two groups: Federalists and Anti-Federalists. The <span data-type="term" group-by="F" id="auto_page_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_term119">Federalists</span> supported it. They tended to be among the elite members of society&#x2014;wealthy and well-educated landowners, businessmen, and former military commanders who believed a strong government would be better for both national defense and economic growth. A national currency, which the federal government had the power to create, would ease business transactions. The ability of the federal government to regulate trade and place tariffs on imports would protect merchants from foreign competition. Furthermore, the power to collect taxes would allow the national government to fund internal improvements like roads, which would also help businessmen. Support for the Federalists was especially strong in New England.</p>
            <p id="auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_fs-id1166227557808">Opponents of ratification were called <span data-type="term" group-by="A" id="auto_page_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_term120">Anti-Federalists</span>. Anti-Federalists feared the power of the national government and believed state legislatures, with which they had more contact, could better protect their freedoms. Although some Anti-Federalists, like Patrick <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="H" id="auto_page_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_term121">Henry</span>, were wealthy, most distrusted the elite and believed a strong federal government would favor the rich over those of &#x201C;the middling sort.&#x201D; This was certainly the fear of Melancton <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="S" id="auto_page_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_term122">Smith</span>, a New York merchant and landowner, who believed that power should rest in the hands of small, landowning farmers of average wealth who &#x201C;are more temperate, of better morals and less ambitious than the great.&#x201D;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_rf-123413"><sup class="os-citation-number">14</sup></a> Even members of the social elite, like Henry, feared that the centralization of power would lead to the creation of a political aristocracy, to the detriment of state sovereignty and individual liberty.</p>
            <p id="auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_fs-id1166227574156">Related to these concerns were fears that the strong central government Federalists advocated for would levy taxes on farmers and planters, who lacked the hard currency needed to pay them. Many also believed Congress would impose tariffs on foreign imports that would make American agricultural products less welcome in Europe and in European colonies in the western hemisphere. For these reasons, Anti-Federalist sentiment was especially strong in the South.</p>
            <p id="auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_fs-id1166227603401">Some Anti-Federalists also believed that the large federal republic that the Constitution would create could not work as intended. Americans had long believed that virtue was necessary in a nation where people governed themselves (i.e., the ability to put self-interest and petty concerns aside for the good of the larger community). In small republics, similarities among members of the community would naturally lead them to the same positions and make it easier for those in power to understand the needs of their neighbors. In a larger republic, one that encompassed nearly the entire Eastern Seaboard and ran west to the Appalachian Mountains, people would lack such a strong commonality of interests.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_rf-123414"><sup class="os-citation-number">15</sup></a></p>

The Constitution contained no provisions for government support of churches or of religious education, and Article VI explicitly forbade the use of religious tests to determine eligibility for public office. This caused many, like Henry <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="A" id="auto_page_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_term123">Abbot</span> of North Carolina, to fear that government would be placed in the hands of &#x201C;pagans . . . and Mahometans [Muslims].&#x201D;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_rf-123415"><sup class="os-citation-number">16</sup></a></p>
            <p id="auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_fs-id1166227687229">It is difficult to determine how many people were Federalists and how many were Anti-Federalists in 1787. The Federalists won the day, but they may not have been in the majority. First, the Federalist position tended to win support among businessmen, large farmers, and, in the South, plantation owners. These people tended to live along the Eastern Seaboard. In 1787, most of the states were divided into voting districts in a manner that gave more votes to the eastern part of the state than to the western part.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_rf-123416"><sup class="os-citation-number">17</sup></a> Thus, in some states, like Virginia and South Carolina, small farmers who may have favored the Anti-Federalist position were unable to elect as many delegates to state ratification conventions as those who lived in the east. Small settlements may also have lacked the funds to send delegates to the convention.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_rf-123417"><sup class="os-citation-number">18</sup></a></p>

Although many writers supported each position, it is the Federalist essays that are now best known. The arguments these authors put forth, along with explicit guarantees that amendments would be added to protect individual liberties, helped to sway delegates to ratification conventions in many states.</p>

Two were the wealthy, populous states of Virginia and New York.

Some who had initially opposed the Constitution, such as Edmund Randolph, were persuaded that the creation of a strong union was necessary for the country&#x2019;s survival and changed their position. Other Virginia delegates were swayed by the promise that a bill of rights similar to the Virginia Declaration of Rights would be added after the Constitution was ratified. On June 25, 1788, Virginia became the tenth state to grant its approval.</p>

The federal system, in which power was divided between the national and state governments, and the division of authority within the federal government into separate branches would prevent any one part of the government from becoming too strong. Furthermore, tyranny could not arise in a government in which &#x201C;the legislature necessarily predominates.&#x201D; Finally, the desire of office holders in each branch of government to exercise the powers given to them, described as &#x201C;personal motives,&#x201D; would encourage them to limit any attempt by the other branches to overstep their authority.

Because these men would be members of a &#x201C;transient&#x201D; body called together only for the purpose of choosing the president and would meet in separate deliberations in each state, they would be free of corruption and beyond the influence of the &#x201C;heats and ferments&#x201D; of the voters. Indeed, Hamilton argued in <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="F" id="auto_page_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_term134"><em data-effect="italics">Federalist</em> No. 70</span>, instead of being afraid that the president would become a tyrant, Americans should realize that it was easier to control one person than it was to control many. Furthermore, one person could also act with an &#x201C;energy&#x201D; that Congress did not possess. Making decisions alone, the president could decide what actions should be taken faster than could Congress, whose deliberations, because of its size, were necessarily slow. At times, the &#x201C;decision, activity, secrecy, and dispatch&#x201D; of the chief executive might be necessary.</p>

The Anti-Federalists also produced a body of writings, less extensive than <em data-effect="italics">The Federalists Papers</em>, which argued against the ratification of the Constitution. However, these were not written by one small group of men as <em data-effect="italics">The Federalist Papers</em> had been.

Once Virginia ratified the Constitution on June 25, 1788, New York realized that it had little choice but to do so as well. If it did not ratify the Constitution, it would be the last large state that had not joined the union. Thus, on July 26, 1788, the majority of delegates to New York&#x2019;s ratification convention voted to accept the Constitution. A year later, North Carolina became the twelfth state to approve. Alone and realizing it could not hope to survive on its own, Rhode Island became the last state to ratify, nearly two years after New York had done so.</p>

Those who opposed a strong central government argued that this failure could allow a handful of powerful men to gain control of the nation and rule it for as long as they wished. Although the framers did not anticipate the idea of career politicians, those who supported the Constitution argued that reelecting the president and reappointing senators by state legislatures would create a body of experienced men who could better guide the country through crises. A president who did not prove to be a good leader would be voted out of office instead of being reelected. In fact, presidents long followed George Washington&#x2019;s example and limited themselves to two terms. Only in 1951, after Franklin <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="R" id="auto_page_5dfb7c7b-c9c2-4911-8769-873adc2d054d_term135">Roosevelt</span> had been elected four times, was the Twenty-Second Amendment passed to restrict the presidency to two terms.</p>

The first ten amendments were added in 1791. Responding to charges by Anti-Federalists that the Constitution made the national government too powerful and provided no protections for the rights of individuals, the newly elected federal government tackled the issue of guaranteeing liberties for American citizens. James <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="M" id="auto_page_40f8c706-891b-4236-891d-13159e643868_term137">Madison</span>, a member of Congress from Virginia, took the lead in drafting nineteen potential changes to the Constitution.</p>
            <p id="auto_40f8c706-891b-4236-891d-13159e643868_fs-id1166226379849">Madison followed the procedure outlined in Article V that says amendments can originate from one of two sources. First, they can be proposed by Congress. Then, they must be approved by a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate before being sent to the states for potential ratification. States have two ways to ratify or defeat a proposed amendment. First, if three-quarters of state legislatures vote to approve an amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution. Second, if three-quarters of state-ratifying conventions support the amendment, it is ratified. A second method of proposal of an amendment allows for the petitioning of Congress by the states: Upon receiving such petitions from two-thirds of the states, Congress must call a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments, which would then be forwarded to the states for ratification by the required three-quarters. All the current constitutional amendments were created using the first method of proposal (via Congress).</p>

Only twelve were approved by two-thirds of both the Senate and the House of Representatives and sent to the states for ratification. Of these, only ten were accepted by three-quarters of the state legislatures. In 1791, these first ten amendments were added to the Constitution and became known as the <span data-type="term" group-by="B" id="auto_page_40f8c706-891b-4236-891d-13159e643868_term138">Bill of Rights</span>.</p>

At the same time, the framers made amending the document sufficiently difficult that it has not been changed repeatedly; only seventeen amendments have been added since the ratification of the first ten (one of these, the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, was among Madison&#x2019;s rejected nine proposals). Recent conversations about needed amendments have related to women's rights, flag burning, and reforming the Electoral College. To date, none of these has advanced.</p>

This was an important acknowledgment that the protected rights were extensive, and the government should not attempt to interfere with them. The Supreme Court, for example, has held that the Ninth Amendment protects the right to privacy even though none of the preceding amendments explicitly mentions this right.

The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments are the result of long-fought campaigns by supporters of abolition and the expansion of voting rights to all citizens regardless of gender or race. These campaigns gathered momentum during the Reconstruction Era, when prominent abolitionist Frederick Douglass argued that African American men had earned the right to vote by their service during the Civil War and women&#x2019;s rights leaders such as Susan B. Anthony and Ida B. Wells organized to promote voting rights for women.</p>

She later became a teacher and writer, and, in her work, advanced the causes of women's suffrage and the abolition of slavery. During the Civil War, she taught newly freed ensalved people in South Carolina and later moved to Washington, DC, where she taught secondary school, wrote poetry, and participated in social movements related to race and gender, including helping establish the National Association of Colored Women and fighting for a woman&#x2019;s right to vote. In 1878, she married Francis J. Grimk&#xE9;, the nephew of famed abolitionists Sarah and Angelina Grimk&#xE9;. Today, her longtime home in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington is on the National Register of Historic Places.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_40f8c706-891b-4236-891d-13159e643868_rf-123411"><sup class="os-citation-number">19</sup></a></p>

It also prohibited states from depriving their residents of life, liberty, or property without a legal proceeding. Over the years, the Fourteenth Amendment has been used to require states to protect most of the same federal freedoms granted by the Bill of Rights.</p>

The Constitution had given states the power to set voting requirements, but the states had used this authority to deny women the right to vote. Most states before the 1830s had also used this authority to deny suffrage to property-less men and often to African American men as well. When states began to change property requirements for voters in the 1830s, many that had allowed free, property-owning African American men to vote restricted the suffrage to White men.

After many years of campaigns for suffrage, as shown in <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_40f8c706-891b-4236-891d-13159e643868_OSC_AmGov_02_05_Suffrage">Figure 2.16</a>, the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="N" id="auto_page_40f8c706-891b-4236-891d-13159e643868_term159">Nineteenth Amendment</span> finally gave women the right to vote in 1920.</p>

Many southern states had used a poll tax, a tax placed on voting, to prevent poor African Americans from voting. Thus, the states could circumvent the Fifteenth Amendment; they argued that they were denying African American men and women the right to vote not because of their race but because of their inability to pay the tax. The last great extension of the suffrage occurred in 1971 in the midst of the Vietnam War.

Many people had complained that the young men who were fighting in Vietnam should have the right to vote for or against those making decisions that might literally mean life or death for them. Many other amendments have been proposed over the years, including an amendment to guarantee equal rights to women, but all have failed.</p>

They were proud to be Englishmen. Much of their pride, however, stemmed from their belief that they were heirs to a tradition of limited government and royal acknowledgement of the rights of their subjects.</p>
            <p id="auto_26e5cf13-84b1-40ad-8538-8fbd73ab94cf_fs-id1166226366666">Colonists&#x2019; pride in their English liberties gave way to dismay when they perceived that these liberties were being abused. People had come to regard life, liberty, and property not as gifts from the monarch but as natural rights no government could take away. A chain of incidents&#x2014;the Proclamation of 1763, the trial of smugglers in courts without juries, the imposition of taxes without the colonists&#x2019; consent, and the attempted interference with self-government in the colonies&#x2014;convinced many colonists that the social contract between the British government and its citizens had been broken. In 1776, the Second Continental Congress declared American independence from Great Britain.</p>

The states maintained the right to govern their residents, while the national government could declare war, coin money, and conduct foreign affairs but little else. Its inability to impose taxes, regulate commerce, or raise an army hindered its ability to defend the nation or pay its debts. A solution had to be found.</p>

The United States that emerged from the Constitutional Convention in September was not a confederation, but it was a republic whose national government had been strengthened greatly. Congress had been transformed into a bicameral legislature with additional powers, and a national judicial system had been created. Most importantly, a federal system had been established with the power to govern the new country.</p>
            <p id="auto_b4b48c79-2ad8-45fe-9993-e37900e03d8a_fs-id1166227570833">To satisfy the concerns of those who feared an overly strong central government, the framers of the Constitution created a system with separation of powers and checks and balances. Although such measures satisfied many, concerns still lingered that the federal government remained too powerful.</p>

The Federalists countered that a strong government was necessary to lead the new nation and promised to add a bill of rights to the Constitution. <em data-effect="italics">The Federalist Papers</em>, in particular, argued in favor of ratification and sought to convince people that the new government would not become tyrannical. Finally, in June 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to approve the Constitution, making it the law of the land. The large and prosperous states of Virginia and New York followed shortly thereafter, and the remaining states joined as well.</p>

To prevent this difficulty from recurring, the framers provided a method for amending the Constitution that required a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and in three-quarters of state legislatures to approve a change.</p>
            <p id="auto_40f8c706-891b-4236-891d-13159e643868_fs-id1166226447303">The possibility of amending the Constitution helped ensure its ratification, although many feared the powerful federal government it created would deprive them of their rights. To allay their anxieties, the framers promised that a Bill of Rights safeguarding individual liberties would be added following ratification. These ten amendments were formally added to the document in 1791 and other amendments followed over the years. Among the most important were those ending slavery, granting citizenship to African Americans, and giving the right to vote to Americans regardless of race, color, or sex.</p>

      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227605088">When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227725621">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. &#x2014;That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, &#x2014;That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. &#x2014;Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227573709">He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227596975">He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227606556">He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227438063">He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227606874">He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227777248">He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227666750">He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227567133">He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227507849">He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227557868">He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.</p>

      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227576907">For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227590038">For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227394485">For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p>

      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227682700">He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227571648">He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.</p>

      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227718196">In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227708551">Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</p>
      <p id="auto_97a153dd-5719-4de8-b8e7-828b7f5b4396_fs-id1166227729482">We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>

In this way, the separate branches must work together to govern the nation. For example, according to the Constitution, Congress has the power to draft legislation. However, the president must sign a piece of proposed legislation before it becomes a law. Thus, the president and Congress must work together to make the nation&#x2019;s laws.</p>
