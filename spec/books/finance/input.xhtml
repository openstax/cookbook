The authors take a balanced approach to micro-and macroeconomics, to both Keynesian and classical views, and to the theory and application of economics concepts.

<li><strong>Supply and Demand</strong>, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.</li>

<li><strong>The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory</strong>, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics portion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different models of market structure, including some simple game theory.</li>
<li><strong>Microeconomic Policy Issues</strong>, Chapters 11 through 18, covers the range of topics in applied micro, framed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities.  Students explore competition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor market issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, as well as public economy.</li>
<li><strong>The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals</strong>, Chapters 19 through 23, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows.</li>
<li><strong>A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis</strong>, Chapters 24 through 26, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.  The model is then applied to the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives.  The expenditure-output model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary and Fiscal Policy</strong>, Chapters 27 through 31, explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary policy and financial regulation.  Then the discussion switches to government deficits and fiscal policy.</li>

<li><strong>International Economics</strong>, Chapters 32 through 34, the final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

In the case of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, we received a wealth of constructive feedback.  Many of the book’s users felt that consequential movement in economic data, coupled with the impacts of national and global events, warranted a full revision. We also took advantage of the opportunity to improve the writing and sequencing of the text, as well as many of the calculation examples. The major changes are summarized below.</p><ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-447"><li>Augmented explanations in chapters one through four provide a more comprehensive and informative foundation for the book. </li>
<li>A clearer explanation, using a numerical example, has been given for finding the utility maximizing combination of goods and services a consumer should choose.</li>
<li>The Theory of Production has been added to the chapter on costs &amp; industry structure.</li>
<li> A more complete treatment has been given to labor markets, including the theories of competitive and monopsonistic labor markets, and bilateral monopoly; and the labor markets chapter and the poverty and
economic inequality chapter have been resequenced.</li>
<li>Substantial revisions to the AD/AS model in chapters 24-26 present the core concepts of macroeconomics in a clearer, more dynamic manner. </li>
<li>Case studies and examples have been revised and, in some cases, replaced to provide more relevant and useful information for students.</li>
<li>Economic data, tables, and graphs, as well as discussion and analysis around that data, have been thoroughly updated.</li> </ul><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-318">Wherever possible, data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) was included and referenced.  In most of these uses, links to the direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged to explore the information and the overall FRED resources more thoroughly.

</p><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-594">Additional updates and revisions appear throughout the book.  They reflect changes to economic realities and policies regarding international trade, taxation, insurance, and other topics.  For issues that may change in the months or years following the textbook's publication, the authors often provided a more open-ended explanation, but we will update the text annually to address further changes. </p><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-204">The revision of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> was undertaken by Steven Greenlaw (University of Mary Washington) and David Shapiro (Pennsylvania State University), with significant input by lead reviewer Daniel MacDonald (California State University, San Bernardino).</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-27"><h4 data-type="title">Pedagogical foundation</h4><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-987">Throughout the OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, you will find new features that engage the students in economic inquiry by taking selected topics a step further. Our features include:
</p><ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-213"><li><strong>Bring It Home:</strong> This added feature is a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter’s main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts:  the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the intro module) and the second at chapter’s end, when students have learned what’s necessary to understand the case and “bring home” the chapter’s core concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Work It Out:</strong> This added feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them step by step to find out how its solution is derived. </li>
<li><strong>Clear It Up:</strong> This boxed feature, which includes pre-existing features from Taylor’s text, addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts with a question.  The rest of the feature explains the answer.</li>
<li><strong>Link It Up:</strong> This added feature is a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students’ understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.  </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-651"><h4 data-type="title">Questions for each level of learning</h4><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-454">The OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> further expands on Taylor’s original end of chapter materials by offering four types of end of module questions for students:
</p><ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-284"><li><strong>Self-Checks</strong> are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They “click to reveal” an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think beyond what is said in the text.  Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through the problem.  </li>
<li><strong>Review Questions</strong> have been retained from Taylor’s version, and are simple recall questions from the chapter in open-response format (not multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text. </li>

</figure><p id="auto_795ab6a1-9ffb-4932-b207-c453fcf54f84_eip-675">One of the most important decisions facing a company is choosing which investments it should make. Should an automobile manufacturer purchase a new robot for its assembly line?  Should an airline purchase a new plane to add to its fleet? Should a hotel chain build a new hotel in Atlanta? Should a bakery purchase tables and chairs to provide a place for customers to eat?</p><p id="auto_795ab6a1-9ffb-4932-b207-c453fcf54f84_eip-237">The process of making these decisions is often referred to as <span data-type="term">capital budgeting</span>. In order to grow and remain competitive, a firm relies on developing new products, improving existing products, and entering new markets. These new ventures require investments in fixed assets. The company must decide whether the project will generate enough cash to cover the costs of these initial expenditures once the project is up and running.</p><p id="auto_795ab6a1-9ffb-4932-b207-c453fcf54f84_eip-185">For example, Sam’s Sporting Goods sells sporting equipment and uniforms. Players on local recreational and school teams purchase much of their gear from Sam’s. Customers have been inquiring about customized items such as baseball caps and equipment bags. Sam’s is considering purchasing an embroidery machine so that it can provide these customized items in house. The machine will cost $16,000. Purchasing the embroidery machine would be an investment in a fixed asset. If it purchases the machine, Sam’s will be able to charge customers for customization. The managers think that selling customized items will allow the company to increase its cash flow by $2,000 next year. As customers become more aware of this service, the managers predict that the ability to customize products in-house will increase cash flow by $4,000 the following year. They expect the machine will be used for five years, with the embroidery products increasing cash flows by $5,000 during each of the last three years the machine is used. Should Sam’s Sporting Goods invest in the embroidery machine? In this chapter we consider the main capital budgeting techniques Sam’s and other companies can  use to evaluate these types of decisions.</p>

The <span data-type="term">payback period</span> calculation focuses on how long it will take for a company to make enough money from the investment to recover the initial cost of the investment.</p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_57edcc4f-20c6-4a18-8c35-696fcebd73b8_eip-971"><h3 data-type="title">Payback Period Calculation</h3><p id="auto_57edcc4f-20c6-4a18-8c35-696fcebd73b8_eip-464">
In order to purchase the embroidery machine, Sam’s Sporting Goods must spend $16,000. During the first year, Sam’s expects to see a $2000 benefit from purchasing the machine, which means that after one year the company has spent $14,000 more than it has made from the project. During the second year it uses the machine, Sam’s expects that its cash inflow will be $4000 greater than it would have been if it had not had the machine. Thus, after two years, the company has spent $10,000 more than what it has benefited from the machine. This process is continued year after year until the accumulated increase in cash flow is $16,000, or equal to the original investment. This process is summarized in Table 16.1.

Thus, the payback period for the embroidery machine is four years. In other words, it takes four years to accumulate $16,000 in cash inflow from the embroidery machine and recover the cost of the machine. </p>

The principal advantage of the payback period method is its simplicity. It can be calculated quickly and easily. It is easy for managers who have little finance training to understand. The payback measure provides information about how long funds will be tied up in a project. The shorter the payback of a project, the greater the project’s liquidity is.

Although it is simple to calculate, the payback period method has several shortcomings. First, the payback period calculation ignores time value of money. Suppose in addition to the embroidery machine, Sam’s is considering several other projects. The cash flows from these projects are shown in Table 16.2. Both Project B and Project C have a payback period of 5 years. For both of the projects, Sam’s estimates that it will take five years for cash inflows to add to $16,000. The payback period method does not differentiate between these two projects.

From what we learned about time value of money in Chapter X, Projects B and C are not identical projects. The payback period breaks the important rule of finance of not adding or comparing cash flows that occur in different time periods.</p><p id="auto_57edcc4f-20c6-4a18-8c35-696fcebd73b8_eip-175">A second disadvantage of using the payback period method is there is not a clearly defined accept/reject criterion. When the payback period method is used, a company will set a length in which a project must recover the initial investment for the project to be accepted. Projects with longer payback periods than the length of time the company has chosen will be rejected. If Sam’s has a payback period of four years, Project A in Table 16.2 would be accepted. Projects B, C, and D have payback periods of five years and would be rejected. Sam’s choice of a payback period of four years is arbitrary; it is not grounded in any financial reasoning or theory. No argument exists for a company to use a payback period of 3, 4, 5, or any other length as its criterion for accepting projects.</p><p id="auto_57edcc4f-20c6-4a18-8c35-696fcebd73b8_eip-758">A third drawback of this method is that cash flows after the payback period are ignored. Projects B, C, and D all have payback periods of 5 years. Projects B and C end after Year 5. Project D has a large cash flow that occurs in Year 6 which is excluded from the analysis.  The payback method is short-sighted in that it favors projects that generate cash flows quickly while possibly rejecting projects that create much larger cash flows if those cash flows occur after the arbitrary payback time criterion.</p><p id="auto_57edcc4f-20c6-4a18-8c35-696fcebd73b8_eip-772">Fourth, no risk adjustment is made for uncertain cash flows. No matter how careful of planning and analysis a company undertakes, a business is seldom sure what future cash flows will be. Some projects are riskier, with less certain cash flows, than others, but the payback period method treats high-risk cash flows the same way as low-risk cash flows.</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="auto_57edcc4f-20c6-4a18-8c35-696fcebd73b8_fs-idm250756752" class="section-summary"><h3 data-type="title">Summary</h3><p id="auto_57edcc4f-20c6-4a18-8c35-696fcebd73b8_fs-idm250404624">The payback period is the simplest project evaluation method.

Because the cash inflows and outflows occur at different time periods, they cannot be directly compared to each other. Instead, they must be translated into a common time period, using time value of money techniques. By converting all of the cash flows that will occur from a project into present value, or current dollars, the cash inflows from the project can be compared to the cash outflows. If the cash inflows exceed the cash outflows, in present value terms, the project will add value and should be accepted.

You simply have to provide the calculator with each cash flow, along with the time period in which that cash flow occurs, and the discount rate that you want to use to discount the future cash flows to the present.</p><p id="auto_0e65f1d2-ac93-4804-b91d-db2d9e0cc419_eip-275">To get an answer to this question, you will need to realize that you will be working with the factors of $1,000, which is the original amount or principal and is considered as the present value (or PV), in this case there will be 4 periods or years (represented by N), and the interest rate (or I/Y) you are using in this calculation is 3%. Note that before entering any data, it is always a good idea to make sure that the calculator register information is cleared. If not, you may end up with numbers that are left over from previous uses of the calculator and may interfere with the solution to the problem you are working on. This register clearing process will depend on what type of calculator you are using, but for the Texas Instruments Business Analyst II calculator, clearing can be accomplished by pressing the keys 2ND FV {CLR TVM} and this will clear all the values in the calculator memory.</p><p id="auto_0e65f1d2-ac93-4804-b91d-db2d9e0cc419_eip-671">Follow these steps for calculating NPV using the Texas Instruments BA II calculator:</p>

The NPV method solves the several of the problems listed with the payback period approach. First, the NPV method uses the time value of money concept. All of the cash flows are discounted back to the present value to be compared. Second, the NPV method provides a clear decision criterion. Projects with a positive NPV should be accepted and projects with a negative NPV should be rejected. Third, the discount rate used to discount future cash flows to the present can be increased or decreased to adjust for the riskiness of the project’s cash flows.

The NPV method can be difficult for someone without a finance background to understand. Also, the NPV method can be problematic when available capital resources are limited. The NPV method provides a criterion for whether or not a project is a good project. It does not always provide a good solution when a company must make a choice between several acceptable projects because funds are not available to do all of the projects.

The cash inflow from this project is expected to be $6,000 next year and $8,000 the following year. The cash inflow is expected to increase by $2,000 yearly, resulting in a cash inflow of $18,000 in Year 7, the final year of the project. You know that your company’s cost of funds is 9%.

The NPV of a project depends upon the expected cash flows from the project and the discount rate used to translate those expected cash flows to the present value. When we used a 9% discount rate, the NPV of the project was $2,836. If a higher discount rate is used, the present value of future cash flows falls, and the NPV of a project falls. Theoretically, we should use the firm’s cost to attract capital as the discount rate when calculating NPV. In reality, it is difficult to estimate this cost of capital accurately and confidently. Because the discount rate is an approximate value, we want to determine whether a small error in our estimate is important to our overall conclusion. We can do this by creating an NPV profile, which graphs the NPV at a variety of discount rates and allows us to determine how sensitive the NPV is to changes in the discount rate.

The <span data-type="term">internal rate of return (IRR)</span> is the discount rate that sets the present value of the cash inflows equal to the present value of the cash outflows. In other words, IRR is the discount rate that sets NPV equal to zero.  In considering whether Sam’s Sporting Goods should purchase the embroidery machine, the IRR method approaches the time value of money problem we considered in the previous section from a slightly different angle. Instead of using the company’s cost of attracting funds for the discount rate and solving for NPV as we did in Equation X, we set NPV equal to zero and solve for the discount rate to find the IRR:

If the IRR is greater than the cost of capital, a project should be accepted. If the IRR is less than the cost of capital, a project should be rejected. The NPV profile graph crossed the horizontal axis at 14%. Therefore, if Sam’s Sporting Goods can attract capital for less than 14%, the IRR exceeds the cost of capital and the embroidery machine should be purchased. However, if it costs Sam’s more than 14% to attract capital, the embroidery machine should not be purchased.</p><p id="auto_c1d2fe69-5c94-4b36-b16a-025fcbb28a6c_eip-270">Calculating IRR without a financial calculator is an arduous, time consuming process which requires trial-and-error to find the discount rate that makes NPV exactly equal zero. Your calculator uses the same type of trial-and-error iterative process, but because it is automating the process can do it much more quickly than you can. A problem that might require 30 minutes of detailed mathematical calculations by hand can be completed in a matter of seconds with the assistance of a financial calculator.</p><p id="auto_c1d2fe69-5c94-4b36-b16a-025fcbb28a6c_eip-382">All of the information your calculator needs to calculate IRR is the value of each cash flow and the time period in which it occurs. To calculate IRR using the TI BA II calculator, begin by entering the cash flows for the project, just as you do for the NPV calculation.  After these cash flows are entered, simply compute IRR in the final step.</p><table id="auto_c1d2fe69-5c94-4b36-b16a-025fcbb28a6c_eip-302" summary="This table shows step-by-step instructions for calculating IRR using the Texas Instruments BA II calculator." class="condensed-table"><colgroup><col data-width="1*" /><col data-width="3*" /><col data-width="2*" /><col data-width="2*" /></colgroup><thead>

The primary advantage of using the IRR method is that it is easy to interpret and explain. Investors like to speak in terms of annual percentage returns when evaluating investment possibilities.
</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="auto_c1d2fe69-5c94-4b36-b16a-025fcbb28a6c_eip-553"><h3 data-type="title">Disadvantages</h3><p id="auto_c1d2fe69-5c94-4b36-b16a-025fcbb28a6c_eip-282">
One disadvantage of using IRR is that it can be tedious to calculate. We knew the IRR was about 14% for the embroidery machine project because we had previously calculated the NPV for several discount rates. The IRR is about, not exactly 14%, because NPV is not exactly equal to zero, just very close to zero, when we use 14% as the discount rate. Before the prevalence of financial calculators and spreadsheets, calculating the exact IRR was difficult and time-consuming. With today’s technology, this is no longer a major consideration. Later in this chapter we look at how to use a financial calculator and a spreadsheet to do these calculations.
</p><p id="auto_c1d2fe69-5c94-4b36-b16a-025fcbb28a6c_eip-356">Another disadvantage of using the IRR method is that there may not be a single mathematical solution to an IRR problem. This can happen when negative cash flows occur at more than one period in the project. Suppose your company is considering building a facility for an upcoming Olympic competition. The construction cost would be $350 million. The facility would be used for one year and generate cash inflows of $950 million. Then the following year your company would be required to convert the facility into a public park area for the city; this conversion is expected to cost $620 million. Placing these cash flows on a timeline results in:</p><table id="auto_c1d2fe69-5c94-4b36-b16a-025fcbb28a6c_eip-93" summary="This table shows the timeline for IRR cash flow." class="timeline-table"><thead>

The NPV is negative at low interest rates, becomes positive at higher interest rates, and then turns negative again as the interest rate continues to rise. Because the NPV profile line crosses the horizontal axis twice, there are two IRRs. In other words, there are two interest rates at which NPV equals zero.</p><figure id="auto_c1d2fe69-5c94-4b36-b16a-025fcbb28a6c_eip-idm371333056"><figcaption>NPV Profile Graph for a Project with Two IRRs</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="auto_c1d2fe69-5c94-4b36-b16a-025fcbb28a6c_grapH_IRR" data-alt="a graph of a project with two IRRs">

The IRR assumes that the cash flows are reinvested at the internal rate of return when they are received. This is a disadvantage of the IRR method because the firm may not be able to find any other projects with returns equal to high-IRR project, so the company may not be able to reinvest at the IRR.
</p><p id="auto_c1d2fe69-5c94-4b36-b16a-025fcbb28a6c_eip-70">This reinvestments rate assumption becomes problematic when a company has several acceptable projects and is attempting to rank the projects. We will look more closely at the issues that this assumption causes when we consider mutually exclusive projects later in this chapter.  If a company is simply deciding whether or not to accept a single project the reinvestment assumption limitation is not relevant.</p><p id="auto_c1d2fe69-5c94-4b36-b16a-025fcbb28a6c_eip-450">Another disadvantage of the IRR method that becomes important when a company is trying to choose among various acceptable projects is that it ignores differences in scale. The IRR converts the cash flows to percentages and ignores differences in the size or scale of projects. Issues the occur when comparing projects of different scale are covered later in this chapter.</p></section>

  <p id="auto_c1d2fe69-5c94-4b36-b16a-025fcbb28a6c_fs-idm240506144">The internal rate of return (IRR) of a project is the discount rate which sets the present value of a project’s cash inflows exactly equal to the present value of the project’s cash outflows. A project should be accepted if its IRR is greater than the firm’s cost of attracting capital. </p>

The payback period method provides a fast, simple approach to evaluating a project but suffers from the fact that it ignores the time value of money. The <span data-type="term">modified payback period</span> method addresses this flaw by discounting cash flows using the company’s cost of funds and then using these discounted values to determine the payback period.
</p><p id="auto_db5bccac-4f32-4f7a-abad-286edef125cc_eip-311">Consider Sam’s Sporting Goods decision earlier regarding whether to purchase an embroidery machine. The expected cash flows, along with the value of these cash flows when discounted using the company’s 9% cost of funds, are shown in Table 16.4. Earlier we calculated the project’s payback period as 4 years; that is how long it would take the company to recover all of the cash that it spends on the project. Remember, however, that the payback period does not consider the company’s cost of funds, it underestimates the true break-even time period.</p><table id="auto_db5bccac-4f32-4f7a-abad-286edef125cc_eip-843" summary="This table shows expected cash flows for the fictional Sam's Sporting Goods." class="timeline-table"><caption>Expected Cash Flows for Sam's Sporting Goods</caption><thead>

This adjusted calculation addresses the payback period method’s flaw of not considering time value of money, but managers are still confronted with the other disadvantages of the payback period.

The modified payback period ignores any cash flows occurring after breakeven occurs which is a serious drawback, especially when comparing mutually exclusive projects.</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="auto_db5bccac-4f32-4f7a-abad-286edef125cc_eip-981"><h3 data-type="title">Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)</h3><p id="auto_db5bccac-4f32-4f7a-abad-286edef125cc_eip-419">

Sometimes, managers must make decisions regarding which of two projects to accept. Or, a company be faced with a number of good, acceptable projects, but must decide which of those projects to take on during the current year.</p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-420"><h3 data-type="title">Choosing Between Mutually Exclusive Projects</h3><p id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-494">
Earlier in this chapter we saw that the embroidery machine that Sam’s Sporting Goods was considering had a positive NPV, making it a project that Sam’s should accept. Another, more expensive embroidery machine may be available that is able to make more stitches per minute. Although the initial cost of this heavy-duty machine is higher, it would allow Sam’s to embroider and sell more items each year, generating more revenue. The two embroidery machines are <span data-type="term">mutually exclusive projects</span>. Mutually exclusive projects compete with one another; choosing one embroidery machine excludes Sam’s from purchasing the other embroidery machine.
</p><p id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-341">Table 16.5 shows the cash outflow and inflows expected from the original embroidery machine considered as well as the heavy-duty machine. The heavy-duty machine costs $25,000, but will generate more cash inflows in years 3-6. Both machines have a positive NPV, leading to an accept decision. Also, both machines have an IRR which exceeds the company’s 9% cost of raising capital, also leading to an accept decision. When considered by themselves, each of the machines is a good project for Sam’s to pursue. The question the managers face is which is the better of the two projects. When faced with this type of decision, the rule is to take the project with the highest NPV. Remember that the goal is to choose projects that add value to the company. Because the NPV of a project is the estimate of how much value is created by a project, choosing the project with the higher NPV is choosing the project which will create the greater value.</p><table id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-434" summary="This table shows the cash outflows and inflows expected for the fictional Sam's Sporting Goods embroidery machine project." class="timeline-table"><caption>Cash Outflows and Inflows Expected</caption><thead>

The investment analysis procedures used by companies are also used by government entities when evaluating projects. Host cities receive direct revenues from broadcast rights, ticket sales, and licensing agreements. The cities also expect indirect benefits from increased tourism, including increased employment and higher tax revenues. These benefits come after the city makes a major investment in infrastructure, spending money on stadiums, housing, and transportation. The investment in infrastructure for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia was over $50 billion. Why do you think the infrastructure investment for these games was so much higher than the amount spent by cities hosting previous games? If your city were discussing the possibility of bidding to be an Olympic host city, what would you suggest it consider when evaluating the opportunity?</p></div></section><section data-depth="1" id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-730"><h3 data-type="title">Choosing Between Projects with Different Lives</h3><p id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-786">
Suppose you are considering starting an ice cream truck business. You find that you can purchase a used truck for $50,000. You estimate that the truck will last for three years and you will be able to sell enough ice cream treats to generate cash inflow of $40,000 during each of those years. Your cost of capital is 10%. The positive NPV of $49,474 for the project makes this an acceptable project.

However, the truck is newer with lower mileage and you estimate that you can use it for six years. This newer truck will allow you to generate cash inflow of $30,000 each year for the next six years. The NPV of the newer truck is $80,658.</p><p id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-996">Because both trucks are acceptable projects but you can only drive one truck at a time, you must choose which truck to purchase. At first, it may be tempting to purchase the newer, lower mileage truck because of its higher NPV. Unfortunately, when comparing two projects that have different lives, a decision cannot be made simply by comparing the NPVs. Although the ice cream truck with the six-year life has a much higher NPV than the larger truck, it consumes your resources for a long time. </p><p id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-937">There are two methods for comparing projects with different lives.

If one project is 5 years and another is 20 years, the short one is repeated four times. This method can become tedious when the length of the longer project is not a multiple of the shorter project. For example, when choosing between a 5-year project and a 7-year project, the short one would have to be duplicated seven times and the long project would have to be repeated 5 times to get to a common length of 35 years for the two projects.</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-215"><h4 data-type="title">Equal Annuity Approach</h4><p id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-644">

Both the replacement chain and equal annuity approaches assume that projects can be replicated with identical projects in the future. It is important to note that this is not always a reasonable assumption; these replacement projects may not exist. Estimating cash flows from potential projects is prone to errors as we will discuss in Chapter 18; these errors are compounded and become more significant as projects are expected to be repeated. Inflation and changing market conditions are likely to result in cash flows varying in the future from our predictions, and as we go further into the future these changes are potentially greater.</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-417"><h4 data-type="title">Choosing Projects When Resources Are Limited</h4><p id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-486">
Choosing positive NPV projects adds value to a company. Although we often assume that the company will choose to do all positive NPV projects, in reality managers often face a budget that restricts the amount of capital that they may invest in a given time period. Thus, managers are forced to choose among a number of positive NPV projects. The goal is to maximize the total NPV of the firm’s projects while remaining within the constrained budget.

For the same $50 million of investment funds, Southwest Manufacturer can accept both Projects E and F for a total NPV of $18 million. Investment capital is a scare resource for this company. By ranking projects based upon their profitability index, the company is able to determine the best way to allocate its scarce capital for the largest potential increase in NPV.</p>

The goal of capital budgeting is choosing the projects that will bring the most value to the shareholders of the company. The NPV rule provides a clear, concise criterion for which projects will bring value to the shareholders. It is important to remember, however, that all of the project valuation calculations are based upon projected cash flows. These projected cash flows are estimates, based upon the best-educated guesses that a company makes about its business opportunities over the next few years. Because no company has a crystal ball that it can currently predict the future, its calculation of NPV is an estimate of what it expects.</p>

<p id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-idm241058944">Think, for example, of an oil company deciding whether to drill for oil. The project will require expenditure on equipment, land, and other items. The cash inflows will depend upon the likelihood that oil is found, the quantity of oil that is produced by the well, and the price at which the oil can be sold. If a company estimates that oil will sell for $100 per barrel during the next few years, the project will have a much higher NPV than if the company estimates that oil will sell for only $50 per barrel.</p>

<p id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-idm241058032">A project that has a positive NPV and is accepted as a company is planning how to allocate its capital toward investments, may end up being a bad project that the company wishes it had avoid if the future is much different than what had been projected. Managers must stay attuned to economic developments and reevaluate capital budgeting decisions when significant changes occur. In Spring 2020, managers around the globe were faced with a dramatically changing economic environment amidst a pandemic. Oil companies, for example, saw oil prices drop from over $100 per barrel at the beginning of March to under $15 per barrel by the end of April.</p>

These companies were cutting their capital budgets by 10%-80% from their originally planned levels for 2020. Reductions were especially large in the oil and gas industry, as companies found their revenue projections, and thus the NPV of their planned projects, falling dramatically. In addition, companies found themselves needing to free up cash; with more limited cash resources, fewer positive NPV projects could be accepted and funded.<a href="#auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-idm261116384" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_21cedae9-5cb2-4c83-9e11-80604b5d4629_eip-idm261116384">Tom Brinded, Zak Cutler, Erikhans Kok, and Prakash Parbhoo, “Resetting Capital Spending in the Wake of COVID-19” McKinsey &amp; Company, June 25, 2020</aside></div>

An advantage of using Excel is that you can quickly change any assumptions or numbers in your problem and recalculate NPV or IRR based upon that updated information. Excel is a versatile tool, with more than one way to set up most problems. We will consider a couple of straightforward examples of using Excel to calculate NPV and IRR.</p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_delete_me">Suppose your company is considering a project that will cost $30,000 this year. The cash inflow from this project is expected to be $6,000 next year and $8000 the following year. The cash inflow is expected to increase by $2,000 yearly, resulting in a cash inflow of $18,000 in Year 7, the final year of the project. You know that your company’s cost of funds is 9% and would like to evaluate this project.</p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-565"><h3 data-type="title">Calculating NPV Using Excel</h3><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-388">
To calculate NPV using Excel, you would begin by placing each year’s expected cash flows in a sheet as in Line 5 in Figure 16.5. One approach for calculating NPV is to use the formula for discounting future cash flows, as is shown in Line 6.

</span></figure><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-558">Alternatively, Excel is programmed with financial functions, including a calculation for NPV. The NPV formula is shown in <strong>Cell J6</strong> in Figure 16.7 below. It is important to pay attention to how Excel defines NPV. The Excel NPV function calculates the sum of the present values of the cash flows occurring from period one through the end of the project, using the designated discount rate. The Excel function fails to include the initial investment at time period zero at the beginning of the project. The NPV function in Cell J6 will return $56,947 for this project. You must subtract the initial cash outflow of $30,000 that occurs at Time 0 to get the NPV of $26,947 for the project. The user must remember to include reference only to the cells which contain cash flows from Year 1 to the end of the project in when entering the Excel programmed NPV function and then subtract out the initial investment of Year 0 to calculate NPV according to the standard definition of NPV equaling the present value of the cash inflows minus the present value of the cash outflows. Because of the non-standard use of the term “NPV” by Excel, many users prefer to use the method described above rather than using this pre-defined function.</p><figure id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-idm397533456"><figcaption>NPV Formula

Excel also provide a function for calculation IRR. This function is shown in Figure 16. 8, Cell J8. The IRR function properly uses all of the projects cash flows, including the initial cash outflow at Time 0 in its calculation, unlike the NPV function. This function will correctly return the IRR of 27.7% for the project.

Firms often do not know exactly what their cost of attracting capital is and must use estimates in their decision making. Also, the cost of attracting capital can change with economic and market conditions. Especially if markets are volatile, a company may use an NPV profile to see how sensitive their decisions are to changes in the financing costs. Excel simplifies the creation of an NPV profile.
</p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-64">Middleton Manufacturing is considering installing solar panels to heat water and provide lighting throughout its plant. To do so will cost the company $800,000 this year. However, this upgrade will save the company an estimated $150,000 in electric costs each year for the next 10 years. Constructing an NPV profile of this project will allow Middleton to see how the NPV of the project changes with the cost of attracting funds.</p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-699">First, the project cash flows must be placed in an Excel spreadsheet, as is shown in cells D2 to N2 in the screenshot in Figure 16.9. The company’s cost of funds is placed in cell B1; begin by putting 10% in for this rate. Next, the formula for NPV is placed in cell B6; cell B6 shows the NPV of the cash flows in cells D2 through N2, using the rate that is in cell B1. </p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-788">For reference, compute IRR in cell B4. Calculating IRR is not necessary for creating the NPV profile. However, it gives a good reference point. Remember that if the IRR of a project is greater than the firm’s cost of attracting capital, then the NPV will be positive, but if the IRR of a project is less than the firm’s cost of attracting capital, then the NPV will be negative.</p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-745">An NPV profile is created by calculating the NPV of the project for a variety of possible costs of attracting capital. In other words, you want to calculate NPV using the cash flows from the project in cells D2 through N2, using a variety of discount rates in cell B1. This is accomplished by using the “Data Table” function of Excel. The Data Table function shows how the outcome of an Excel formula changes when one of the cells in the spreadsheet changes. In this instance, you want to determine how the value of the NPV formula (Cell B6) changes when the discount rate (Cell B1) changes.</p><figure id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-idm392920432"><figcaption>Project Cash Flows Inserted into Excel

Thus, you will highlight cells A6 through B26. Click “data” at the top of the Excel menu so that you see the “What If? Analysis” feature. Choose “data table”. Because the various discount rates you want to use are in a column, use the “Column input cell” option. Place “B1” in this box.

To create the graph, begin by highlight the discount rates and NPVs that are in Cells A7 through B26. Next, select “Insert” from the menu at the top of Excel. A number of different chart options will be available; choose “Scatter.” You will end up with a chart that looks like the one in the Figure 16.12 screenshot. You can customize the chart by renaming it, labeling the axes, and making other cosmetic changes if you like.</p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-925">You will notice that the NPV profile crosses the X-axis between 13% and 14%; remember that the NPV will be zero when the discount rate that is used to calculate the NPV is equal to the project’s IRR, which we had calculated to be 13.43%. If the firm’s cost of raising funds is lower than 13.43%, the NPV profile shows that the project has a positive NPV and the project should be accepted. Conversely, if the firm’s cost of raising funds is greater than 13.43%, the NPV of this project will be negative and the project should not be accepted.</p><figure id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-idm361117344"><figcaption>NPV Profile Created Using Excel

If the managers think that the cost of attracting funds for the company is 10%, then the project has a positive NPV of $121,685 and the company should install the panels. The NPV profile shows that if the managers are underestimating the cost of funds, even by 30%, and it will really cost Middleton 13% to attract funds, the project is still a good project. The cost of attracting funds would have to be higher than 13.43% for the solar panel project to be a project that should be rejected.</p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-630">As of year-end 2020, the S&amp;P 500 firms had a combined market capitalization of $33.4 trillion, about 66% of the estimated U.S. equity market capitalization of $50.8 trillion.<a href="#auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-idm257424368" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-idm257424368"><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-number-of-companies-publicly-traded-in-the-us-is-shrinkingor-is-it-2020-10-30?mod=investing">Market Watch</a><span data-type="newline"><br /></span>

</figure><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-idm254100240">Warren Buffett has not always been one of the richest people in the world, but he has always been one of the hardest workers. An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he “likes math: a future stockbroker”. Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of dollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining pinball machines in barbershops.</p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-774">As they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines” and Buffett has made his share of hay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in the world with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020. </p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-949">The “Oracle of Omaha”, as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most notably as the Chairman, President, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire Hathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying shares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the company and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business away from textiles eventually becoming the largest financial services company in the world including total ownership of the Geico Insurance Company.</p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-610">Buffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his current and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, the author of “Security Analysis”, “The Intelligent Investor”, and famous value investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis of financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied the same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire people. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don't have the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you're going to get someone without integrity, you want them lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked”.</p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-117">Undoubtedly, Buffett’s folksy way of making his point will be another of his legacies. When asked repeatedly about how he managed to be such as successful investor Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you can’t understand”. Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000 when the dot com craze fueled the stock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding earnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst and suddenly he was back on top. When asked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield”.</p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-439">Buffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago" and "If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.”</p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-743">The third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and Melinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200 billionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes. Buffett states, “If you're in the luckiest 1% of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99%”. Buffett has begun the process to give away most of his fortune, but he has left this pearl of wisdom for his own children, “A very rich person should leave his kids enough to do anything, but not enough to do nothing”.</p><p id="auto_c56a3aa2-4237-4fe1-8ffa-34762ee37cd1_eip-377">(Sources: https://www.goalcast.com/2017/11/09/25-warren-Buffett-quotes-filled-practical-timeless-wisdom/

        <div data-type="question-stimulus">You will be living in your college town for two more years. You are considering purchasing a townhouse that will cost you $250,000 today. You estimate that your expenses for each of the next two years will be $6,000 less than if you rent an apartment. You think that you would be able to lease the townhouse to another college student for $12,000 and that your taxes, maintenance, and other expenses for the townhouse would be $5,000 per year. You expect to lease the townhouse for five years before you sell it; you expect to be able to sell the townhouse for $275,000. Use Excel to create an NPV profile for this undertaking.</div>
        <div data-type="question-stem">If it will cost you 3% to borrow money, should you buy the townhouse? What if it will cost you 8% to borrow money?</div>
