<p id="auto_7de3b56d-445f-4792-810c-ed53a481786e_fs-idm411595216">You have been elected as the coordinator of committees for your school’s business honor society. In essence, this makes you the manager of all the committees. This is a new position that was created because the committees have never been evaluated for their effectiveness within the organization. Your job in this position is to ensure that the committees—such as recruiting, fundraising, community service, professional activities, and regional and national conference presentations—are operating within the goals put forth in the society’s mission statements, as well as to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of each committee in meeting the organization’s goals. Your starting point is to understand the overriding mission—the strategic direction and purpose—of the society. Next, you want to understand how each committee fits into the strategic goal of the society and then identify the separate goals of each committee. Once you understand the purpose and goal of each committee, it will be necessary to know how each committee is going about meeting its goals. Last, you will evaluate each committee to see if the goals are being met.</p>

<p id="auto_7de3b56d-445f-4792-810c-ed53a481786e_fs-idm388835584">Notice that in performing your role as the coordinator of committees, you will need financial information, such as budgets and financial statements, along with other nonfinancial information, for example, the society’s mission statement, each committee’s strategy statement, and records of their activities and meetings. To help assess how well the honor society and its committees are meeting their goals, you need more information than can be obtained from simply looking at the various financial documents assembled by each committee within the organization. The same is true in any business organization. Managers and other internal decision makers need more information than is available in the basic financial statements: they need information generated by the managerial accounting system.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm357818384">Financial accounting process provides a useful level of detail for external users, such as investors and creditors, but it does not provide enough detailed information for the types of decisions made in the day-to-day operation of the business or for the types of decisions that guide the company long term. <span data-type="term">Managerial accounting</span> is the process that allows decision makers to set and evaluate business goals by determining what information they need to make a particular decision and how to analyze and communicate this information. Let’s explore the role of managerial accounting in several different organizations and at different levels of the organization, and then examine the primary responsibilities of management.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm365246096">Three friends who are recent graduates from business school, Alex, Hana, and Gillian, have each just begun their first postgraduation jobs. They meet for lunch and discuss what each of their jobs entails. Alex has taken a position as a market analyst for a Fortune 500 company that operates in the shipping industry. Her first assignment is to suggest and evaluate ways the company can increase the revenue from shipping contracts by 10 percent for the year. Before tackling this project, she has a number of questions. What is the purpose of this analysis? What type of information does she need? Where would she find this information? Can she get it from a basic income statement and balance sheet? How will she know if her suggestions for pricing are creating more shipping contracts and helping to meet the company’s goal? She begins with an analysis of the company’s top fifty customers, including the prices they pay, discounts offered, discounts applied, frequency of shipments, and so on, to determine if there are price adjustments that need to be made to attract those customers to use the company’s shipping services more frequently.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm370293584">Hana has a position in the human resources department of a pharmaceutical company and is asked to research and analyze a new trend in compensation in which employers are forgoing raises to employees and are instead giving large bonuses for meeting certain goals. Her task is to ascertain if this new idea would be appropriate for her company. Her questions are similar to Alex’s. What information does she need? Where would she find this information? How would she determine the impact of this type of change on the business? If implemented, what information would she need to assess the success of the plan?</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm374536176">Gillian is working in the supply chain area of a major manufacturer that produces the various mirrors found on cars and trucks. Her first assignment is to determine whether it is more cost effective and efficient for her company to make or purchase a bracket used in the assembly of the mirrors. Her questions are also similar to her friends’ questions. Why is the company considering this decision? What information does she need? Where would she find this information? Would choosing the option with the lowest cost be the correct choice?</p>

Although none of these individuals is given the title of manager, they need information to help provide management with the information necessary to make decisions to move the company forward with its strategic plan. The scenarios of the three women are not unique. These types of questions occur every day in businesses across the world.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm364149792">Some decisions will be more clearly appropriate for higher-level management. For example, Lynx Boating Company produces three different lines of boats (sport boats, pontoon boats, and large cruisers). All three boat lines are profitable, but the pontoon boat line seems to be less profitable than the other two types of boats. Management may want to consider abandoning the pontoon line and using that additional capacity to produce one of the other more profitable lines. They would need detailed financial information in order to make such a decision.</p>

</div>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm370444000">Service organizations also face decisions that require more detailed information than is available in financial accounting statements. A company’s financial statements aggregate information for the company as a whole, but for most managerial decisions, information must be gathered in a timely manner at a product, customer, or division level. For example, the management of City Hospital is considering the purchase of four new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines that scan three times faster than their current machines and thus would allow the hospital’s imaging department to evaluate eight additional patients each day. Each machine costs $425,000 and will last five years before needing to be replaced. Would this be a wise investment for City Hospital? Hospital management would need the appropriate information to assess the alternatives in order to make this decision. Throughout your study of managerial accounting, you will learn about the types of information needed to make these decisions, as well as techniques for analyzing this information. First, it is important to understand the various roles managers play in the organization in order to understand the types of information and the level of detail that are needed. Most of the job responsibilities of a manager fit into one of three categories: planning, controlling, or evaluating.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm370525024">The model in <a href="#auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_OSX_Acct_M01_01_MissionSt" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> sums up the three primary responsibilities of management and the managerial accountant’s role in the process. As you can see from the model, the function of accomplishing an entity’s mission statement is a circular, ongoing process.</p>

This statement should be broad enough that it will encompass future growth and changes of the company. <a href="#auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm376388736" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> contains the mission statement of three different types of companies: a manufacturer, an e-commerce company, and a service company.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm381174832">Once the mission of the company has been determined, the company can begin the process of setting <span data-type="term">goals</span>, or what the company expects to accomplish over time, and <span data-type="term">objectives</span>, or the targets that need to be met in order to meet the company’s goals. This is known as <span data-type="term">planning</span>. Planning occurs at all levels of an organization and can cover various periods of time. One type of planning, called <span data-type="term">strategic planning</span>, involves setting priorities and determining how to allocate corporate resources to help an organization accomplish both short-term and long-term goals. For example, one hotel may want to be the low-price, no-frills, clean alternative, while another may decide to be the superior quality, high-price luxury hotel with many amenities. Obviously, to be successful, either of these businesses must determine the goals necessary to meet their particular strategy.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm373659472">Typically, a strategic plan will span any number of years an organization chooses (three, five, seven, or even ten years), and often companies will have multiple strategic plans, such as one for three years, one for five years, and one for ten years. Given the time length involved in many plans, the organization also needs to factor in the potential effects of changes in their senior executive leadership and the composition of the board of directors.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm374430704">What types of objectives are part of a strategic plan? Strategic objectives should be diverse and will vary from company to company and from industry to industry, but some general goals can include maximizing market share, increasing short-term profits, increasing innovation, offering the best value for the cost, maintaining commitment to community programs, and exceeding environmental protection mandates.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm362770192">From a managerial accounting perspective, planning involves determining steps or actions to meet the strategic or other goals of the company. For example, Daryn’s Dairy, a major producer of organic dairy products in the Midwest, has made increasing the market share of its products one of its strategic goals. However, to be truly effective, the goals need to be defined specifically. For example, the goals might be stated in terms of percentage growth, both annually and in terms of the number of markets addressed in their growth projections.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm370373568">Also, Daryn’s planning process would include the steps the company plans to use to implement to increase market share. These plans may include current-year plans, five-year plans, and ten-year plans.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm366469504">The current-year plan may be to sell the company’s products in 10 percent more stores in the states in which it currently operates. The five-year plan may be to sell the products internationally in three countries, and the ten-year plan may be to acquire their chief competitor and, thus, their customers. Each of these plans will require outlining specific steps to reach these goals and communicating those steps to the employees who will carry out or have an impact on reaching these goals and implementing these plans.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm373323472">Planning can involve financial and nonfinancial processes and measures. One planning tool discussed in <a href="#page_de2d2ed2-6dd3-4b33-bce4-95cd02be4d0f">Budgeting</a> is the budgeting process, which requires management to assess the resources—for example, time, money, and number and type of employees needed—to meet current-year objectives. Budgeting often includes both financial data, such as worker pay rates, and nonfinancial data, such as the number of customers an employee can serve in a given time period.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm373038656">A retail company can plan for the expected sales volume, a hospital can plan for the number of x-rays they expect to administer, a law firm can plan the hours expected for the various types of legal services they perform, a manufacturing firm can plan for the level of quality expected in each item produced, and a utility company can plan for the level of air pollutants that are acceptable. Notice that in each of these examples, the aspect of the business that is being planned and evaluated is a qualitative (nonfinancial) factor or characteristic. In your study of managerial accounting, you will learn about many situations in which both financial and nonfinancial data or information are equally relevant. However, the qualitative aspects are typically not quantified in dollars but evaluated using some other standards, such as customers served or students advised.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm326572624">While these functions are initially stated in qualitative terms, most of these items would at some point be translated into a dollar value or dollar effect. In each of these examples, the managerial accounting function would help to determine the variables that would help appropriately measure the desired goal as well as plan how to quantify these measures. However, measures are only useful if tracked and used to determine their effectiveness. This is known as the control function of management.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm365532784"><h3 data-type="title">Controlling</h3>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm365532144">To measure whether plans are meeting objectives or goals, management must put in place ways to assess success or lack of success. <span data-type="term">Controlling</span> involves the monitoring of the planning objectives that were put into place. For example, if you have a retail store and you have a plan to minimize shoplifting, you can implement a control, such as antitheft tags that trigger an alarm when someone removes them from the store. You could also install in the ceilings cameras that provide a different view of customers shopping and therefore may catch a thief more easily or clearly. The antitheft tags and cameras serve as your controls against shoplifting.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm365530704">Managerial accounting is a useful tool in the management control function. Managerial accounting helps determine the appropriate controls for measuring the success of a plan. There are many types of controls that a company can use. Some controls can be in the form of financial measures, such as the ratio for inventory turnover, which is a measure of inventory control and is defined as Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory, or in the form of a performance measure, such as decreasing production costs by 10 percent to help guide or control the decisions made by managers. Other controls can be physical controls, such as fingerprint identification or password protection. Essentially, the controlling function in management involves helping to coordinate the day-to-day activities of a business so that these activities lead to meeting corporate goals.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm358005952">Without controls, it is very unlikely a plan would be successful, and it would be difficult to know if your plan was a success. Consider the plan by Daryn’s Dairy to increase market share. The plan for the first year was to increase market share by selling the company’s products in 10 percent more stores in the states in which the company already operates. How will the company implement this plan? The implementation, or carrying out, of the plan will require the company to put controls in place to measure which new stores are successfully selling the company’s products, which products are being sold the most, what the sales volume and dollar value of the new stores are, and whether the sales in these new stores are affecting the volume of sales in current stores. Without this information, the company would not know if the plan is reaching the desired result of increased market share.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm375539520">The control function helps to determine the courses of action that are taken in the implementation of a plan by helping to define and administer the steps of the plan. Essentially, the control function facilitates coordination of the plan within the organization. It is through the system of controls that the actual results of decisions made in implementing a plan can be identified and measured. Managerial accounting not only helps to determine and design control measures, it also assists by providing performance reports and control reports that focus on variances between the planned objective performance and the actual performance. Control is achieved through effective feedback, or information that is used to assess a process. Feedback allows management to evaluate the results, determine whether progress is being made, or determine whether corrective measures need to be taken. This evaluation is in the next management function.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm350546800">Managers must ultimately determine whether the company has met the goals set in the planning phase. <span data-type="term">Evaluating</span>, also called <em data-effect="italics">assessing</em> or <em data-effect="italics">analyzing</em>, involves comparing actual results against expected results, and it can occur at the product, department, division, and company levels. When there are deviations from the stated objectives, managers must decide what modifications are needed.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm360535504">The controls that were put into place to coordinate the implementation of a particular company plan must be evaluated so that success can be measured, or corrective action can be taken. Consider Daryn’s Dairy’s one-year plan to increase market share by selling products in 10 percent more stores in the states in which the company currently operates. Suppose one of the controls put into place is to measure the sales in the current stores to determine if selling the company’s products in new stores is adding new sales or merely moving sales from existing stores. This control measure, same-store sales, must be evaluated to determine the effect of the decision to expand the selling of products within the state. This control measure will be evaluated by comparing sales in the current year in those stores to sales from the prior year in those same stores. The results of this evaluation will help guide management in their decision to move forward with their plan, to modify the plan, or to scrap the plan.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm356941312">As discussed previously, not all evaluations will involve quantitative or financial measures. In expanding market share, the company wants to maintain or improve its reputation with customers and does not want the planned increased availability or easier access to their products to decrease customer perceptions of the products or the company. They could use customer surveys to evaluate the perceived effect on the company’s reputation as a result of implementing this one-year plan. However, there are many ways that companies can evaluate various controls. In addition to the financial gauges, organizations are now measuring efficiencies, customer development, employee retention, and sustainability.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm360317968">Managers spend their time in various stages of planning, controlling, and evaluating. Generally, higher-level managers spend more time on planning, whereas lower-level managers spend more time on evaluating. At any level, managers work closely with the managerial accounting team to help in each of these stages. Managerial accountants help determine whether plans are measurable, what controls should be implemented to carry out a plan, and what are the proper means of evaluation of those controls. This would include the type of feedback necessary for management to assess the results of their plans and actions. Management accountants generate the reports and information needed to assess the results of the various evaluations, and they help interpret the results.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm360969296">To put this in context, think about how you will spend your weekend. First, you are the manager of your own time. You must plan based on your workload and on how much time you will spend studying, exercising, sleeping, and meeting with friends. You then control how your plan is implemented by setting self-imposed or possibly group meeting–imposed deadlines, and last, you evaluate how well you carried out your plan by gathering more data—such as grades on assignments, personal fulfillment, and number of hours of sleep—to determine if you met your plans (goals). Not planning, controlling, and evaluating often results in less-than-desirable outcomes, such as late assignments, too little sleep, or bad grades. In this scenario, you did not need a separate managerial accountant to help you with these functions, because you could manage planning, controlling, and evaluating on your own. However, in the business world, most businesses will have both managers and managerial accountants. <a href="#auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm368571168" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates some examples.</p>

<li>The purpose of managerial accounting is to supply financial and nonfinancial information to the organization’s management and other internal decision makers.</li>
<li>Most of the job responsibilities of a manager fit into one of three categories: planning, controlling, and evaluating.</li>
<li>Planning involves setting goals and forming the plans to achieve those goals.</li>
<li>Controlling involves the day-to-day activities. Its purpose is to help in planning functions and to facilitate coordination within the organization.</li>
<li>Evaluation determines whether plans are being followed and whether progress is being made as planned toward the fulfillment of organizational goals and objectives. It also involves taking corrective measures in case of deviations identified in the course of action.</li>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm374093136">Answers will vary but should include the following: Managers must determine what modifications and changes need to be made to operations to get back on track to meet the stated goals and objectives. Managers need to decide if stated goals and objectives should continue to be pursued as they are, or if they should be modified or completely scrapped. Examples may include revising inventory controls to include antitheft tags that trigger an alarm when inventory is moved from an approved location in order to reduce inventory losses; installing more cameras in more strategic locations to further reduce theft from shoplifting; revising the financial metrics such as ratios or other performance measurements to provide more meaningful and timely insight to help determine how to get back on track; investigating why market share has not changed as expected by talking to the sales force and analyzing market data; evaluating same-store sales to understand how to expand sales in accordance with goals and objectives; and investigating why a production process has experienced a bottleneck and how to relieve the pressure in that specific area, such as making sure appropriate raw materials are available in a timely manner to avoid machine shutdowns waiting on materials to arrive.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm378289696">Now that you have a basic understanding of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">managerial accounting</span>, consider how it is similar to and different from <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">financial accounting</span>. After completing a financial accounting class, many students do not look forward to another semester of debits, credits, and journal entries. Thankfully, managerial accounting is much different from financial accounting. Also known as <em data-effect="italics">management accounting</em> or <em data-effect="italics">cost accounting</em>, managerial accounting provides information to managers and other users within the company in order to make more informed decisions. The overriding roles of managers (planning, controlling, and evaluating) lead to the distinction between financial and managerial accounting. The main objective of management accounting is to provide useful information to managers to assist them in the planning, controlling, and evaluating roles.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm347894064">Unlike managerial accounting, financial accounting is governed by rules set out by the <span data-type="term">Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)</span>, an independent board made up of accounting professionals who determine and publicize the standards of financial accounting and reporting in the United States. Larger, publicly traded companies are also governed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in the form of the <span data-type="term">generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)</span>, the common set of rules, standards, and procedures that publicly traded companies must follow when they are composing their financial statements.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm366211152">Financial accounting provides information to enable stockholders, creditors, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions. This information can be used to evaluate and make decisions for an individual company or to compare two or more companies. However, the information provided by financial accounting is primarily historical and therefore is not sufficient and is often synthesized too late to be overly useful to management. Managerial accounting has a more specific focus, and the information is more detailed and timelier. Managerial accounting is not governed by GAAP, so there is unending flexibility in the types of reports and information gathered. Managerial accountants regularly calculate and manage “what-if” scenarios to help managers make decisions and plan for future business needs. Thus, managerial accounting focuses more on the future, while financial accounting focuses on reporting what has already happened. In addition, managerial accounting uses nonfinancial data, whereas financial accounting relies solely on financial data.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm372719536">For example, Daryn’s Dairy makes many different organic dairy products. Daryn’s managers need to track their costs for certain jobs. One of the company’s top-selling ice creams is their seasonal variety; a new flavor is introduced every three months and sold for only a six-month period. The cost of these specialty ice creams is different from the cost of the standard flavors for reasons such as the unique or expensive ingredients and the specialty packaging. Daryn wants to compare the costs involved in making the specialty ice cream and those involved in making the standard flavors of ice cream. This analysis will require that Daryn track not only the cost of materials that go into the product, but also the labor hours and cost of the labor, plus other costs, known as overhead costs (rent, electricity, insurance, etc.), that are incurred in producing the various ice creams. Once the total costs for both the specialty ice cream and the standard flavored ice cream are known, the cost per unit can be determined for each type. These types of analyses help a company evaluate how to set pricing, evaluate the need for new or substitute ingredients, manage product additions and deletions, and make many other decisions. <a href="#auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_OSX_Acct_M01_02_DarynDairy" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows an example of a materials cost analysis by Daryn’s Dairy used to compare the materials cost for producing 500 gallons of their best-selling standard flavor—vanilla—with one of their specialty ice creams—Very Berry Biscotti.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm319270608">The information generated from the reports of financial accountants tends to be used primarily by <span data-type="term">external users</span>, including the creditors, tax authorities and regulators, investors, customers, competitors, and others outside the company, who rely on the financial statements and annual reports to access information about a company in order to make more informed decisions. Since these external people do not have access to the documents and records used to produce the financial statements, they depend on Generally Applied Accounting Principles (GAAP). These outside users also depend greatly on the preparation of audits that are done by public accounting firms, under the guidelines and standards of either the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).</p>
<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm357610832">Managerial accounting information is gathered and reported for a more specific purpose for <span data-type="term">internal users</span>, those inside the company or organization who are responsible for managing the company’s business interests and executing decisions. These internal users may include management at all levels in all departments, owners, and other employees. For example, in the budget development process, a company such as <strong class="colored-text">Tesla</strong> may want to project the costs of producing a new line of automobiles. The managerial accountants could create a budget to estimate the costs, such as parts and labor, and after the manufacturing process has begun, they can measure the actual costs, thus determining if they are over or under their budgeted amounts. Although outside parties might be interested in this information, companies like <strong class="colored-text">Tesla</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">Microsoft</strong>, and <strong class="colored-text">Boeing</strong> spend significant amounts of time and money to keep their proprietary information secret. Therefore, these internal budget reports are only available to the appropriate users. While you can find a cost of goods sold schedule in the financial statements of publicly traded companies, it is difficult for outside parties to break it down in order to identify the individual costs of products and services.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm357608064">Financial accounting information is communicated through <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">reporting</span>, such as the financial statements. The financial statements typically include a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, retained earnings statement, and footnotes. Managerial accounting information is communicated through reporting as well. However, the reports are more detailed and more specific and can be customized. One example of a managerial accounting report is a budget analysis (variance report) as shown in <a href="#auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_OSX_Acct_M01_02_BudVarAn" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Other reports can include cost of goods manufactured, job order cost sheets, and production reports. Since managerial accounting is not governed by GAAP or other constraints, it is important for the creator of the reports to disclose all assumptions used to make the report. Since the reports are used internally, and not typically released to the general public, the presentation of any assumptions does not have to follow any industry-wide guidelines. Each organization is free to structure its reports in the format that organizes its information in the best way for it.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm357602112">The financial statements are typically generated quarterly and annually, although some entities also require monthly statements. Much work is involved in creating the financial statements, and any adjustments to accounts must be made before the statements can be produced. A physical count inventory must be done to adjust the inventory and cost of goods sold accounts, depreciation must be calculated and entered, all prepaid asset accounts must be reviewed for adjustments, and so forth. The annual reports are not finalized for several weeks after the year-end, because they are based on historical data; for a company that is traded on one of the major or regional stock exchanges, it must have an audit of the financial statements conducted by an independent certified public accountant. This audit cannot be completed until after the end of the company’s fiscal year, because the auditors need access to all of the information for the company for that year. For companies that are privately held, an audit is not normally required. However, potential lenders might require an independent audit.</p>
<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm360956864">Conversely, managers can quickly attain managerial accounting information. No external, independent auditors are needed, and it is not necessary to wait until the year-end. Projections and estimates are adequate. Managers should understand that in order to obtain information quickly, they must accept less precision in the reporting. While there are several reports that are created on a regular basis (e.g., budgets and variance reports), many management reports are produced on an as-needed basis.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm357598704">The general purpose of financial statement <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">reporting</span> is to provide information about the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of an organization. This data is useful to a wide range of users in order to make economic decisions. The purpose of the reporting done by management accountants is more specific to internal users. Management accountants make available the information that could assist companies in increasing their performance and profitability. Unlike financial reports, management reporting centers on components of the business. By dividing the business into smaller sections, a company is able to get into the details and analyze the smallest segments of the business.</p>
<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm357597072">An understanding of managerial accounting will assist anyone in the business world in determining and understanding product costs, analyzing break-even points, and budgeting for expenses and future growth (which will be covered in other parts of this course). As a manager, chief executive officer, or owner, you need to have information available at hand to answer these types of questions:</p>
<ul id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm357596288" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>Are my profits higher this quarter over last quarter?</li>
<li>Do I have enough cash flow to pay my employees?</li>
<li>Are my jobs priced correctly?</li>
<li>Are my products priced correctly in order for me to make the profit I need to make?</li>
<li>Who are my most productive and least productive employees?</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm366780464">In the world of business, information is power; stated simply, the more you know, typically, the better your decisions can be. Managerial accounting delivers data-driven feedback for these decisions that can assist in improving decision-making over the long term. Business managers can leverage this powerful tool in order to make their businesses more successful, because management accounting adds value to common business decision-making. All of this readily available information can lead to great improvements for any business.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm319163440">Because financial accounting typically focuses on the company as a whole, external users of this information choose to invest or loan money to the entire company, not to a department or division within the company. Therefore, the global focus of financial accounting is understandable.</p>
<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm319162752">However, the focus of management accounting is typically different. Managerial reporting is more focused on divisions, departments, or any component of a business, down to individuals. The mid-level and lower-level managers are typically responsible for smaller subsets within the company.</p>
<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm319162064">Managers need accounting reports that deal specifically with their division and their specific activities. For instance, production managers are responsible for their specific area and the results within their division. Accordingly, these production managers need information about results achieved in their division, as well as individual results of departments within the division. The company can be broken into segments based on what managers need—for example, geographic location, product line, customer demographics (e.g., gender, age, race), or any of a variety of other divisions.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm359947616">Both financial reports and managerial reports use <span data-type="term">monetary accounting information</span>, or information relating to money or currency. Financial reports use data from the accounting system that is gathered from the reporting of transactions in the form of journal entries and then aggregated into financial statements. This information is monetary in nature. Managerial accounting uses some of the same financial information as financial accounting, but much of that information will be broken down to a more detailed level. For example, in financial reporting, net sales are needed for the income statement. In managerial accounting, the quantity and dollar value of the sales of each product are likely more useful. In addition, managerial accounting uses a significant amount of <span data-type="term">nonmonetary accounting information</span>, such as quantity of material, number of employees, number of hours worked, and so forth, which does not relate to money or currency.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm319158752">Financial reports rely on structure. They are generated using accepted principles that are enforced through a vast set of rules and guidelines, also known as GAAP. As mentioned previously, companies that are publicly traded are required to have their financial statements audited on an annual basis, and companies that are not publicly traded also may be required to have their financial statements audited by their creditors. The information generated by the management accountants is intended for internal use by the company’s divisions, departments, or both. There are no rules, guidelines, or principles to follow. Managerial accounting is much more flexible, so the design of the managerial accounting system is difficult to standardize, and standardization is unnecessary. It depends on the nature of the industry. Different companies (even different managers within the same company) require different information. The most important issue is whether the reporting is useful for the planning, controlling, and evaluation purposes.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm375560496">Suppose you have been hired by Daryn’s Dairy as a market analyst. Your first assignment is to evaluate the sales of various standard and specialty ice creams within the Midwest region where Daryn’s Dairy operates. You also need to determine the best-selling flavors of ice cream in other regions of the United States as well as the selling patterns of the flavors. For example, do some flavors sell better than others at different times of the year, or are some top sellers sold as limited-edition flavors? Remember that one of the strategic goals of the company is to increase market share, and the first step in meeting this goal is to sell their product in 10 percent more stores within their current market, so your research will help upper-level management carry out the company’s goals. Where would you gather the information? What type of information would you need? Where would you find this information? How would the company determine the impact of this type of change on the business? If implemented, what information would you need to assess the success of the plan?</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm368185328">Reports generated from financial accounting are a compilation of a company’s various transactions and contain aggregated information for the entire company in the form of financial statements. For publicly traded companies, these reports follow the rules set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). In addition, the financial statements are verified by external auditors. Reports generated by managerial accounting are varied in nature because they are driven by the questions that need to be addressed by management. Different companies and different questions require different reports. Managerial accounting reports are therefore on a more detailed level, such as on a product or division level. There are no specific rules guiding the creation of these reports, and they are usually unaudited.</p>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm273707056">It is clear that management accountants must have a solid foundation in accounting, in both financial and managerial accounting, but other than accounting skills, what makes good managerial accountants?</p>

<ul id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm252780128" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>They must have knowledge of the business in which they are working. <span data-type="term">Commercial awareness</span> is knowing how a business is run and how it is influenced by the external environment and knowing and understanding the overall industry within which the business is operating.</li>
<li><span data-type="term">Collaboration</span>, which involves working in cross-functional teams and earning the trust and respect of colleagues in order to complete a task, is vital to improving managerial accounting talents. They should be “team players.”</li>
<li>Management accountants should have <span data-type="term">effective communication</span> skills that allow them to convey accounting information in both written and oral forms in a way that the intended audience can understand. Being able to gather the data quickly and accurately is important, but the data is meaningless if it is not presented in an intuitive style that the audience can understand.</li>
<li>Strong technology skills are also essential. These skills include not only accounting and reporting software but also other programs that would assist in automating processes, improving efficiencies, and adding value to the company. For many companies, additional software and accompanying technology are often needed for both their financial and managerial accounting functions. For example, <em data-effect="italics">enterprise resource planning</em> (ERP) systems often play a major role in the creation of comprehensive accounting systems. This additional support is often provided by outside suppliers such as <strong class="colored-text">Hyperion</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">Cognos</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">Sage</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">SAP</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">PeopleSoft</strong>, and <strong class="colored-text">Oracle</strong>.</li>
<li>Managerial accountants must possess extensive analytical skills. They must regularly work with financial analysts and management personnel to find ways to reduce expenses and analyze budgets. These skills include the ability to envision, verbalize, conceptualize, or solve both multifaceted and simplistic problems by making choices that make sense with the given information.</li>
<li>Managerial accountants must have ethics and values. They should be an example to others and encourage them to follow internal control practices and procedures. Ethics is discussed in more detail in <a href="#page_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8">Describe the role of the Institute of Management Accountants and the use of ethical standards</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm265729696">Managers at all levels make many different types of decisions every day, but to make most decisions, they need specific information. Some information is easily obtainable, and some is not. Managers do not always know what information they need or what is available, and they need to know if the decisions they make are having the desired outcome and meeting specific goals.</p>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm274324848">To this point, we’ve described <em data-effect="italics">managerial accounting</em> as a process. The following definition considers it a profession. Management accountants are the individuals who help management with this information. The Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) defines management accounting as “a profession that involves partnering in management decision making, devising planning and performance management systems, and providing expertise in financial reporting and control to assist management in the formulation and implementation of an organization’s strategy.”<a href="#auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm265027328" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm265027328">“Management Accounting Careers.” Institute of Management Accountants. https://www.imanet.org/students/management-accounting-careers?ssopc=1</aside>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm267393040">Management accountants work at various levels of the organization, from the project level to the division level to the controller and chief financial officer. Often, management accountants work where they are needed and not necessarily at corporate headquarters. They tend to be hands-on in the decision-making process. They need many types of information to inform the many decisions they must make.</p>

The structure helps define roles and responsibilities. The organizational charts provide guidance to employees and other stakeholders by outlining the official reporting affiliations that direct the workflow within the organization. If the company is particularly efficient, it also will include contact information within the chart. This is a convenient directory to circulate among employees. It helps them find a particular person in a certain position, or determine whom to speak to about certain areas within the company, or even identify a specific person’s supervisor to report positive or negative work behavior.</p>

The board selects the officers who will implement the policies and strategic goals that the board has set in place. The <span data-type="term">chief executive officer (CEO)</span> is the corporation officer who has the overall responsibility for the management of the company. The person overseeing all of the accounting and finance concerns is the <span data-type="term">chief financial officer (CFO)</span>. This individual is in charge of the financial planning and record-keeping of the organization and reports to the CEO. The <span data-type="term">controller</span> is responsible for the accounting side of the business (accounting records, financial statements, tax returns, and internal reports) and reports to the CFO. Also reporting to the CFO is the <span data-type="term">treasurer</span>, who is in control of the finance side of the business (cash position, corporation funds). An additional area that sometimes falls under the control of the CFO is the internal audit staff. Internal auditors supply independent assurance that a company’s internal control processes are effective. However, there is strong support for keeping the internal audit staff outside of the CFO, because of a possible conflict of interest.</p>

Its year-end is December 31. Because of poor cash flow management, the CFO has some concerns about having enough cash to be able to pay the tax bill that is expected. In early December, the purchasing department bought excess hops, barley, malt, oats, and yeast in anticipation of brewing more beer for the holiday and Super Bowl seasons. In order to decrease the company’s net income, thereby reducing their taxable income, the CFO tells you to enter the purchase of this inventory as part of the “Supplies Expense” in the current year.</p>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm271219072">The field of managerial accounting, or corporate accounting, is composed of the financial and accounting responsibilities required to operate any type of business. Managerial accountants are employed within organizations to monitor costs, sales, budgets, and spending; conduct audits; predict future requirements; and aid the executive leaders of the organization with financial decision-making.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm269185552"><a href="#auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_OSX_Acct_M01_03_Salaries" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> lists approximate salaries for several financial and managerial accounting employment positions. In reviewing the salary information, be aware that there are often major variances in salaries based on geographical locations. For example, a cost accountant manager in San Francisco, California, would typically be paid significantly more than an accountant in a similar position in Fayetteville, Arkansas. However, the cost of living, especially housing costs, in San Francisco is also significantly higher than the cost of living in Fayetteville.</p>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm274315904">Managerial accountants find employment opportunities in a wide variety of settings and industries. Professionals in this discipline are in high demand from public and private companies, government agencies, and not-for-profit entities (NFPs). Some areas of management accounting are versatile to any sector (corporate, government, or NFP).</p>
<ul id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm200611040" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>A <span data-type="term">financial analyst</span> assists in preparing budgets, tracking actual costs, examining task performance, scrutinizing different types of variances, and supporting other management personnel in organizing forecasts and projections.</li>
<li>A <span data-type="term">budget analyst</span> arranges and manages the master budget and compares master budget projections to actual results. This individual must be vastly aware of all operations in the budget and work closely with the rest of the accounting staff as well as management personnel.</li>
<li>An <span data-type="term">internal auditor</span> typically reports to high-level executives within the company. An internal auditor is often called on to investigate budget variances, industrial sabotage, poor work quality, fraud, and theft. He or she also safeguards the internal controls and confirms they are working and effective.</li>
<li>A <span data-type="term">cash-management accountant</span> has responsibilities that include transferring monies between accounts, monitoring deposits and payments, reconciling cash balances, creating and tracking cash forecasts, and performing all other cash-related financial processes.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm275583616">Other areas of managerial accounting are specific to the sector in which accountants work. For example, the area of cost accounting is more specific to the corporate or manufacturing sector. These <span data-type="term">cost accountants</span> amass large sums of data, checking for accuracy and then formulating the cost of raw materials, work in process, finished goods, labor, overhead, and other associated manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm275193152">Governmental entities also use accounting to communicate with their constituents. <span data-type="term">Government agencies</span> include all levels of government, federal, state, county, and city, including military, law enforcement, airports, and school systems. Government accountants deal with budgets, auditing, and payroll, the same as all other managerial accountants. However, they must follow a different set of accounting rules called the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm259015584"><span data-type="term">Nonprofit (not-for-profit) organizations</span> are tax-exempt organizations that serve their communities in a variety of areas, such as religion, education, social services, health care, and the arts. Managerial accountants in this area are most often focused on budgets. The biggest difference between a corporate budget analyst and a nonprofit budget analyst is that the nonprofit analyst works the budget backward, compared to the corporate analyst. For example, if a corporation was selling widgets, its budget would start with a sales forecast of how many widgets the company thinks it can sell. This gives the company a forecast of how much it can spend on expenses and fixed assets. The nonprofit budget analysts often start with the expenses. They forecast how much the expenses will be in order to continue to offer their service to the community. From there, they then adjust how much they will need to obtain through fundraising, donations, grants, or other sources to meet their expenses.</p>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm269379744">There are many distinct accounting certifications that accountants can earn in order to improve their careers, attain promotions, and acquire raises in their pay. The certifications are somewhat different from each other and focused toward different career paths. Many accountants have more than one of these credentials to diversify their paths.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm269987392">The <span data-type="term">Certified Public Accountant (CPA)</span> is considered the top tier in accounting certifications. Many companies or positions require CPA certification. For example, most employees at accounting firms earn a CPA certificate within the first few of years of graduation. Some positions, such as controller or CFO, often require CPA certification. In the United States, each state has different educational and experience requirements in order to obtain the CPA. The certification requires passing the four-part CPA exam as well. This is administered by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). There are four parts to the exam: Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR), Auditing and Attestation (AUD), Regulation (REG), and Business Environment and Concepts (BEC). Each part is graded on a 100-point scale. A score of seventy-five or greater must be achieved in order to pass each section. The exams can be intimidating, as it is a difficult process to go through. As of 2017, the AICPA reported a pass rate of less than 50 percent, which may contribute to its high regard around the world. After passing the CPA exam, candidates must work for one year under the supervision of a licensed CPA before their own license is approved by a state regulatory agency. Those certified in public accounting work in all areas of accounting. However, do not assume that being a CPA is the only way to secure an excellent position in accounting.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm246057120">The <span data-type="term">Certified Management Accountant (CMA)</span> is another top-tiered certification for accountants. The CMA title identifies the individual as a specialist in corporate accounting management. The CMA has some overlap with the CPA, but the CPA is focused more on compliance, tax, and controls. CMAs favor financial analytics, budgeting, and strategic assessment. This certification requires the minimum of a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university, two years of work experience, and successfully passing both parts of the exam. Part one of the exam covers financial reporting, planning, performance, and controls. Part two focuses on financial decision-making. The exam is administered by the IMA and has a 50 percent passing rate globally.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm276613776">Not as popular in the United States as the CPA, the <span data-type="term">Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)</span> certification is more in demand throughout Europe and Asia. This certification prepares accountants for a career in the finance and investment domains. Requirements of this credential include a bachelor’s degree or four years’ worth of experience, plus passing all three sections of the exam. The exam is administered by the CFA Institute. There are three separate exams, each one taking up to six hours to complete. The exams must be completed in succession. This credential is considered one of the more rigorous ones to obtain, with a passing rate of less than 45 percent.</p><p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm273937328">The <span data-type="term">Enrolled Agent (EA)</span> credential focuses on a career in taxation, whether it is working in tax preparation for the public, internally for a corporation, or for the government at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The EA certification was created by the IRS to signify significant knowledge of the US tax code and the ability to apply the concepts of that code. Enrolled agents have the privilege of being able to sign tax returns as paid preparers, and they are able to represent their clients in front of the IRS. The EA certification can be obtained by passing a three-part exam covering all types of individual and business tax returns. Once the certification is obtained, enrolled agents must follow strict ethical standards and complete 72 hours of continuing education courses every three years.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm267756672">The <span data-type="term">Certified Internal Auditor (CIA)</span> is a credential offered by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and is one of the only certifications that is accepted worldwide. CIAs tend to be employed in auditing areas within government agencies, banking, finance, or corporations. They examine financial documents to investigate deficiencies in internal controls. Requirements for this certification include a bachelor’s degree, two years of work experience in a related field, and passing the three sections of the examination. Also required are providing character references, following a code of ethics, and continuing education.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm270992272">The <span data-type="term">Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE)</span> certification signifies proven proficiency in fraud prevention, detection, and deterrence. CFEs are instructed in how to identify the red flags that may indicate fraudulent actions. The designation is awarded by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) after applicants have met the following requirements: bachelor’s degree, two years of work-related experience, moral character references, and the passing of four separate exams.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm245612960">The <span data-type="term">Certified Government Auditing Professional (CGAP)</span> designation is exclusively for auditors employed throughout the public sector (federal, state, local) and is offered by the IIA. Requirements for this credential are the same as for the CIA. The exam has 115 multiple-choice questions and covers four areas focusing on proficiency in generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm265233904">These certifications lead to different job responsibilities and different career paths. As indicated, each of the certifications requires varying degrees of education and has exams that are unique to that particular certification. All of these certifications also require a certain number of hours of continuing education in order to keep the certification active. This ensures that the certificate holder is up to date on changes in the field. There are always many opportunities throughout the year to obtain continuing education credits through seminars, webinars, symposiums, and online and in-person classes.</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm357031536">As you’ve learned, unlike the specific rules set forth by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">GAAP</span> and the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">SEC</span> that govern financial accounting, managerial accounting does not have specific rules and is considered flexible, as the reporting stays internal and does not need to follow external rules. Managers of a business need detailed information in a timely manner. This means that a managerial accountant needs to understand many detailed aspects of how the company operates in addition to financial accounting methods, because the framework of typical management reports often comes from the financial statements. However, the reports can be individualized and customized to the information the manager is seeking. Each company has different strategies, timing, and needs for information.</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm386589648">The <span data-type="term">Institute of Management Accountants (IMA)</span>, the professional organization for management accountants, provides research, education, a means of knowledge sharing, and practice development to its members. The IMA also issues the Certified Management Accountant (CMA) certification to those accountants who meet the educational requirements, pass the rigorous two-part exam, and maintain continuing professional education requirements. The CMA exam covers essential managerial accounting topics as well as topics on economics and finance. Many accountants hold both CMA and CPA certifications.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm352784736"><h3 data-type="title">Business Ethics</h3>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm356789664">The IMA also develops standards and principles to help management accountants deal with ethical challenges. Trust is an important cornerstone of business interactions, both internal and external. When there is a lack of trust, it changes how decisions are made. Trust develops when there are good <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">ethics</span>: when people know right from wrong. Consider these three questions as put forth by the Institute of Business Ethics: (1) Do I mind others knowing what I have done? (2) Who does my decision affect or hurt? (3) Would my decision be considered fair to those affected? These questions can help evaluate the ethics of a decision.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm401206224">Ethics is more than simply obeying laws; it involves doing the right thing as well as the legal thing. Many companies have a code of conduct to help guide their employees. For example, <strong class="colored-text">Google</strong> has a code of ethics that they expect all of their employees and board members to follow. Failing to do so can cause termination of employment. The preface of the code includes “Don’t be evil.” They use that to show all employees and other shareholders within Google that they are serious about ethics—that trust and respect are essential in providing a great service to their customers.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm526998640">The IMA has its own Statement of Ethical Professional Practice for its members. Managerial accountants should never commit acts that violate the standards of ethics, and they should never ignore such deeds by others within their companies. Many other professional organizations, across many different professions, have codes of ethics. For example, there are codes of ethics for the AICPA, ACFE, Financial Executives International, American Marketing Association, National Society of Professional Engineers, and the American Nurses Association.</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm391013584">Four standards of ethical conduct in management accountants’ professional activities were developed by the Institute of Management Accountants. The four standards are competence, confidentiality, integrity, and credibility. Credibility is a key standard that is based on an accountant communicating information with fairness and objectivity, disclosing all information that is relevant to the intended users understanding, and disclosing “delays or deficiencies in information, timeliness, processing, or internal controls in conformance with organization policy and/or applicable law.”<a href="#auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm355366848" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm355366848">Institute of Management Accountants. “Standards of Ethical Conduct for Management Accountants.” AccountingVerse. https://www.accountingverse.com/managerial-accounting/introduction/code-of-ethics.html</aside>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm402128464">Often, when we think of unethical behavior, we imagine large-scale scenarios involving tens of thousands of dollars or more, but ethical issues are more likely faced on a small scale. For example, suppose you work for an organization that makes and sells virtual reality headsets. Because of competition, your company has decreased their forecasted sales for next year by 20 percent over the current year. In a meeting, the CEO expressed concern over the effect of the decreased sales on the bonuses of upper-level executives, since their bonus is tied to meeting income projections. The vice president of marketing suggested in the meeting that if the company simply continued to produce the same number of headsets as they had in the previous year, income levels may still be achieved in order for the bonuses to be awarded. This would involve the company producing excess inventory with hopes of selling them, in order to achieve income levels sufficiently adequate to be able to pay bonuses to executives. While a conflict of interest might not be intuitively obvious, the company (and thus its managerial accountants) has an obligation to many stakeholders such as investors, creditors, employees and the community. The obligation of a corporation to these stakeholders depends somewhat on the stakeholder. For example, the primary obligation to a creditor may be to make timely payments, the obligation to the community may be to minimize negative environmental impact. Most stakeholders to not have access to internal information or decisions and thus rely on management to be ethical in their decision-making. The company may indeed be able to sell all that it produces, but given the forecasted drop in sales, producing the same number of units as during the current year will likely lead to unsellable inventory, the need to sell the units at a significant discount in order to dispose of them, or both. Following the recommendation to produce more than forecasted sales might hurt the value of the company’s stock, which could hurt many categories of stakeholders who depend on the accountants and financial analysts to protect their financial interests.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm379693584">In addition to managing production and inventory, a budget and the entire budget process have an impact on managerial decision-making. Suppose you are the manager of the research department of a pharmaceutical company. Your budget includes the costs for various types of training for your staff. Because of the amount of time spent in development of a highly promising medication to treat diabetes, your staff has not had time to complete as much training during the current year as you had allowed for in the budget. You are concerned that if you do not use the training money, your training budget will be decreased in the next budget cycle. To prevent this from happening, you arrange for several online training sessions for your staff. These training sessions are on the basics of laboratory safety. All of your staff is very experienced and current on this topic and can likely go straight to the course completion quiz and complete it in a matter of minutes without actually watching any of the ten modules. What would encourage a manager to schedule and spend money on training that is not useful for the employees? While it is expected to stay within the budget, many managers will spend any “excess” amounts remaining in the budget at the end of the fiscal year. This practice is known as “use it or lose it.” Managers do this to avoid having their budgets cut in the next fiscal year. Stated simply, management spends everything in their budget regardless of the value added or the necessity. This is not ethical behavior and is usually the result of a budgetary process that needs to be modified so that the possibility of being able to pad the budget is removed or at least minimized.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm384106944">All employees within a company are expected to act ethically within their business actions. This can sometimes be difficult when the company itself almost promotes the idea of unethical actions. For example, <strong class="colored-text">Wells Fargo</strong> started offering incentives to their employees who succeeded in selling to current customers other services and products that the bank had to offer. This incentive created an unethical culture. Employees manufactured fake accounts, credit cards, and other services in order to qualify for the bonuses. In the end, 5,300 employees lost their jobs, and everyone learned a lesson on creating proper incentives. Executives who aspire to run an ethical company can do so, if they change reward systems from “pay for performance” to more holistic values. Examples of proper incentives include attendance rewards, merit rewards, team bonuses, overall profit sharing, and stock options.</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm355528016">Most, if not all, major corporations have a code of ethics or a code of conduct. Read <a href="https://openstax.org/l/50GoogleCode">Google’s Code of Conduct</a> and consider the following questions:</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm373810960">In response to several corporate scandals, the United States Congress passed the <span data-type="term">Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)</span>, also known as the “public company accounting reform.” It is a federal law (http://www.soxlaw.com/) that was a far-reaching reform of business practices. Its focus is primarily on public accounting firms that act as auditors of publicly traded corporations. The act intended to protect investors by enhancing the accuracy and reliability of corporate financial statements and disclosures. Thousands of corporations now must confirm that their accounting processes comply with SOX. The act itself is fairly detailed, but the most significant issues for compliance are as follows:</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm355591440">Individuals who work throughout the accounting profession have a significant responsibility to the general public. Financial accountants deliver information about companies that the public uses to make major financial decisions. There must be a level of trust and confidence in the ethical behavior of these accountants. Just like others in the business world, accountants are confronted endlessly with ethical dilemmas. A high standard of ethical behavior is expected of those employed in a profession. While ethical codes are helpful guidelines, the rationale to act ethically must originate from within oneself, from personal morals and values. There are steps that can provide an outline for examining ethical issues:</p>
<ol id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm393119456" type="1">
<li>Recognize the ethical issue at hand and those involved (employees, creditors, vendors, and community).</li>
<li>Establish the facts of the situation (who, what, where, when, and how).</li>
<li>Recognize the competing values related to the issue (confidentiality and conflict of interest).</li>
<li>Determine alternative courses of action (do not limit yourself).</li>
<li>Evaluate each course of action and how each relates to the values in step 3.</li>
<li>Recognize the possible consequences of each course of action and how each affects those involved in step 1.</li>
<li>Make a decision, and take a course of action.</li>
<li>Evaluate the decision. (Is the issue solved? Did it create other issues?)</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm404964688">You are about to sign a new client to a very large contract worth over $900,000. Your supervisor is under a lot of pressure to increase sales. He calls you into his office and tells you his future with the company is in jeopardy, and he asks you to include the revenue for the new contract in the sales figures for the quarter that ends today. You know the contract is a certainty, but the client is out of town and cannot possibly sign for at least a week. Use the eight steps in examining an ethical situation to determine how you would react to this situation.</p>
</div>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm384042864">One of the issues with ethics is that what one person, community, or even country considers unethical or wrong may not be problematic for another person, community, or country, who see it as a way of doing business. For example, <span data-type="term">bribery</span> in the world of business happens when an organization or representative of an organization gives money or other financial benefits to another individual, business, or official in order to gain favor or to manipulate a business decision. Bribery in the United States is illegal. However, in Russia or China, a bribe is sometimes one cost of doing business, so it is part of their culture and completely ordinary.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm397234160">The <span data-type="term">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)</span> was implemented in 1977 in the aftermath of disclosures of bribery of foreign bureaucrats by more than 400 US corporations. The law is broken down into two parts: the antibribery section and the accounting section. The antibribery section specifically prohibits payments to foreign government officials to aid in attaining or retaining business. This provision applies to all US persons and foreign firms acting within the United States. It also requires corporations that are listed in the United States to converge their accounting records with certain accounting provisions. These include making and keeping records that fairly represent the transactions of the company and maintaining an acceptable system of internal controls. Companies doing business outside the United States are obligated to follow this law and dedicate resources to its compliance.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm398105728">The accounting section of the FCPA requires a company to have good internal controls so a slush fund to pay bribes cannot be created and maintained. A <em data-effect="italics">slush fund</em> is a cash account that is often created for illegal activities or payments that are not typically recorded on the books.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm386815088">More details on the SOX and the FCPA are covered in such courses as auditing, intermediate accounting, cost accounting, and business law.</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm392985280">As a corporate accountant, it is very important to understand both financial and managerial aspects of the company and industry in which you are working. In order to assist management in their roles of planning, controlling, and evaluating, an accountant needs to be aware not only of GAAP but also of the products or services offered by the company, the processes by which those products or services are produced, and pertinent facts about suppliers, customers, and competitors. Not having this knowledge not only makes it more difficult for the corporate or managerial accountant to perform any assigned duties, but there is also an ethical responsibility to be knowledgeable in order to offer assistance, analysis, or recommendations to management or customers.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm388666016">Assume you have been hired by <strong class="colored-text">Triumph Motorcycles</strong> as a new logistics analyst.

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm366287936">Ways to learn about the company and industry include the company website, press or news releases, industry trade journals, company internal documents such as procedure manuals and job descriptions, and conversations or interviews with fellow employees at various levels of the organization. The more knowledge you have regarding financial and managerial accounting, the better you can link the operations of the organizations to financial results and the more easily you can ascertain both efficiencies and inefficiencies in the organization.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm231652432">The business environment never rests. Regulations are always changing, global competition continues to increase, and technology provides continual disruption. Management accounting is always evolving due to changes in the business environment. The types of information needed and obtainable have changed significantly over time.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm240387840">Many areas of employment are impacting businesses and the managerial accounting function today. For example, more than 60 percent of workers in the United States are employed within service industries, such as government agencies, marketing firms, accounting firms, and airlines. The health-care and social service industries have doubled in size. However, as the number of service jobs has increased, the number of manufacturing jobs, as a percentage of all jobs, has been decreasing.<a href="#auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm230321408" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a> One of the primary reasons for the decline in manufacturing jobs is automation and other technological changes.</p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm230321408">Dr. Patricia Buckley. “Geographic Trends in Manufacturing Job Creation: Something Old, Something New.” <em data-effect="italics">Deloitte Insight</em>. September 25, 2017. https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/economy/behind-the-numbers/geographic-trends-in-manufacturing-job-creation.html</aside>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm213867072">How are service industries different from manufacturing organizations? The fundamental difference is the product they sell. The service company, such as a marketing, legal, or consulting firm, produces <span data-type="term">intangible goods</span>, meaning that the product has no physical substance. Manufacturing companies produce <span data-type="term">tangible goods</span>, which customers can handle and see. This leads to another significant difference between manufacturing companies and service firms: inventory. Service firms, unlike manufacturing, do not have large inventories, because there is no tangible product. Manufacturing will have inventories of raw materials, of goods that are in the process of being produced and goods that have been completed but not yet sold. Managerial accountants must track all of this information for manufacturing companies. However, managerial accountants are still needed within service-based firms to track time, materials, and overhead. For example, Boeing Company is a manufacturer of airplanes. Their accountants must track several different types of inventory categories, direct labor, and overhead costs, among other things. One of Boeing’s customers, <strong class="colored-text">Delta Air Lines</strong>, is a service-based company. The managerial accountants for the airline also are responsible for following costs, but their reports are targeted toward industry-specific measures such as operating margins, revenue from passenger miles, load factors, and passenger yield, among others.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm234874576">Much of managerial accounting focuses on manufacturing. However, the techniques used for cost accounting for manufacturing companies also can be applied to service-based organizations. The former would develop a cost of goods manufactured schedule, and the latter would need a cost of service schedule. The structure of the reports is principally the same, but section headings would reflect the type of organization.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm194293440"><h3 data-type="title">Technology</h3>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm234385808">Business entities always look for ways to leverage <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">technology</span>. Any type of technology that can increase production, reduce costs, or increase safety will attract attention from the business world. There are many areas of technology that businesses have used already, but to continue reaping those benefits, these companies need to adjust quickly with the ever-advancing business technology.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm219602400">Companies have the ability to integrate many of their business processes through <span data-type="term">enterprise resource planning (ERP)</span> systems, which help companies streamline their operations and help management respond quickly to change. Although they are expensive, these systems help alleviate the complications that arise from business systems that do not coordinate with one another. For example, a company may have many different individual systems for each function: human resources may have a system to track employees’ insurance benefits, training, and retirement programs, while payroll may have a program that tracks employees’ earnings, taxes, deductions, and direct deposit information. Much of the information human resources and payroll collect is the same. Having one system with different silos is much more efficient than having two separate systems. Management must be aware of and adapt to whichever type of system that the business has—either one ERP or several independent systems that may not coordinate information (<a href="#auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_OSX_Acct_M01_05_ERP_img" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm213856560">Businesses have been on the forefront of advancing technology. As computer systems developed throughout the twentieth century, they brought with them the potential for many benefits, but the business world needed to adapt and transform their infrastructure. Over the last forty years, tangible assets (buildings, machinery, and vehicles) have declined from 80 percent of a company’s value to 15 percent, while intangible assets (trademarks, patents, and competencies) are now at an average of 85 percent of a company’s value. It can be difficult to put a value on some of the intangible assets, but it is not hard to realize they do have worth. <strong class="colored-text">JetBlue</strong> has the number one brand loyalty of all North American airlines. <strong class="colored-text">Apple</strong> has built a kingdom around brand loyalty. Intangible assets can give a company a competitive edge, entice consumers, and protect the organization’s brain trust.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm242647888">Technological advances can directly affect managerial accounting reports, through estimates of overhead costs. Historically, overhead was typically calculated on the basis of relatively straightforward relationships, such as direct labor costs or direct labor hours. With the advancements through automation, in many instances, direct labor costs are much lower and no longer relevant in computing overhead costs. <span data-type="term">Automation</span> is a method of using systems such as computers or robots to operate different processes and machinery to improve efficiencies and lower direct labor costs. Companies use automation to remove the complex, superfluous stages from a process in order to streamline the practice. In essence, labor is being traded for machine production. Such industries as auto production are excellent examples. This exchange of direct labor for greater costs in overhead for such factors as machinery depreciation will be addressed in <a href="#page_3793c23f-6b7d-447e-8213-14c1a6efe51d">Job Order Costing</a> and <a href="#page_7a51fb77-1243-4806-b8ba-1bb2c90475a7">Process Costing</a> on calculating production costs.</p>

This <a href="https://openstax.org/l/50Ford">100-second video from <strong class="colored-text">Ford Motor Company</strong> on automation</a> demonstrates this concept.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm193901264">With the growth of the Internet and the speed by which information is shared, businesses can now communicate with employees from around the world within seconds. This has made outsourcing common in certain sectors. <span data-type="term">Outsourcing</span> is hiring workers outside of the company who perform their tasks inside or outside of the country. Most of the exported jobs have gone to less-developed countries, where there are lower labor costs. Outsourcing saves the company money on labor and overhead costs and has become a major trend over the past several years. More and more organizations, both large and small, are now using outsourcing as a way of growing their entities without adding additional labor and overhead costs. Outsourcing allows a company to focus on its own competencies and hire those outside sources to handle other duties.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm231723504">Another technology that is quickly becoming widespread is <span data-type="term">radio-frequency identification (RFID)</span>. This technology uses electromagnetic fields to routinely identify and trace inventory tags that have been attached to objects. The tags contain information that has been stored by electronic means. The RFID tags can made into many shapes and sizes and enclosed in many different materials. These tiny devices have advantages over the common bar code. They do not need to be positioned precisely over the scanner and cannot be manipulated like barcodes. This technology has been used for many years in identifying and tracking lost pets, but it was considered too expensive for more extensive use in industry. With the advancements over the last several years, RFID devices are now seen as “throwaway” control devices. One company recently signed a contract to sell 500 million RFID tags at a cost of about ten cents per device. Other current uses include antitheft tags attached to merchandise, credit card chips, and heavy-duty transponders used in shipping containers. New uses being investigated include RFID chips in passports, food, and people.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm239902144">With the increase in global businesses and competition, there has been an increased focus on outsourcing in order to reduce costs. As you’ve learned, outsourcing involves hiring an outside company to provide services or products rather than having them produced internally.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm235496240">For example, you are the vice president of operations for a manufacturing firm. Other firms similar to yours have outsourced some of the product assembly. You estimate that you could save a significant amount of money on wages and benefits, as you would let go approximately ten workers if you outsource. Would you outsource? Why or why not?</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm184708976">All companies want to be successful. This requires continuously trying to improve the function of the organization. A <span data-type="term">lean business model</span> is one in which a company strives to eliminate waste in its products, services, and processes, while still fulfilling the company’s mission. This type of model was originally implemented by the Japanese automaker, <strong class="colored-text">Toyota Motor Corporation</strong>, soon after the end of World War II. The implications of an organization adopting a lean business model can be overall business improvement, but a lean business model can be difficult to implement because it often requires all systems and procedures that an organization follows to be readjusted and coordinated. Managerial accounting plays a vital role in the success and implementation of a lean business model by providing accurate cost and performance evaluation information. Entities must comprehend the nature and sources of costs and develop systems that encapsulate costs accurately. The better an organization is at controlling costs, the more it can improve its overall financial performance. <span data-type="term">Continuous improvement</span> is the manufacturing process that rejects the ideas of “good enough.” It is an ongoing effort to improve processes, products, services, and practices. This philosophy has led organizations to adopt practices such as total quality management, just-in-time manufacturing, and Lean Six Sigma. The fundamental ideas of all of these involve continuous improvement; they differ only in focus.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm204050192"><span data-type="term">Total quality management (TQM)</span> concentrates on quality improvement and applies this benchmark to all aspects of business activities. In TQM, management and employees look to reveal waste and errors, streamline the supply chain, improve customer relations, and confirm that employees are informed and properly trained. The objective of TQM is continuous improvement by concentrating on systematic problem-solving and customer service. Scientific methods are used to study what succeeds and what does not, and then the best practices are implemented throughout the organization.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm230710288">However, the pursuit of total quality will cost the company money. With the help of management accountants, companies can track these costs and forecast whether or not the improvements will eventually save the organization money down the road.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm200136432"><span data-type="term">Just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing</span> is an inventory system that companies use to increase efficiency and decrease waste by receiving goods only as they are needed within the production process, thereby reducing warehousing costs. This method requires accurate forecasting. Managerial accountants work together with purchasing and production schedulers in keeping the flow of materials accurate and efficient.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm214023568">This method was initiated by Toyota Motor Corporation, and it has expanded to many other manufacturing organizations throughout the world. Toyota set the example by controlling their inventory levels by relying on their supply chain to deliver the raw materials it needed to build their cars. The parts arrived just as they were needed, not before or after.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm202898336">One major advantage of JIT manufacturing is reducing costs by eradicating warehouse storage needs. Organizations, in turn, tend to spend less money on raw materials because of a reduction in spoilage and waste. Another advantage is that companies can easily move from the assembly of one product to the assembly of another.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm200007440">Disadvantages of JIT manufacturing start with its complexity. In moving from a traditional manufacturing approach to a JIT approach, management must reconfigure the entire flow of the production process, from the initial use of the raw materials to the output of the final finished good. Another disadvantage of JIT manufacturing is that it makes organizations more susceptible to disruptions in the supply chain. If a supplier of raw materials has a labor strike, weather problems, a breakdown of machinery, or some other catastrophe and cannot deliver the materials on time, that one supplier can shut down an entire production process and delay delivery of finished goods. An example of this occurred in 2011 after a tsunami and earthquake hit Japan and disrupted production at a critical supplier of auto parts. <strong class="colored-text">General Motors (GM)</strong> facilities in the United States announced they would have to shut down assembly plants where they could not continue production without the parts from Japan.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm235434432"><span data-type="term">Lean Six Sigma (LSS)</span> is a quality control program that depends on a combined effort of many team members to enhance performance by analytically removing waste and diminishing variations between products. The <em data-effect="italics">lean</em> component of LSS is the concept that anything that is not needed in a product or service, or any unnecessary steps that exist, add cost to the product or service and therefore should be considered waste and eliminated. The <em data-effect="italics">Six Sigma</em> component of LSS has to do with the elimination of defects. Essentially, as a company becomes leaner, it should also be able to reduce defects in manufacturing or in providing a service. Fewer defects add to cost savings through the need for fewer reworked products, fewer repeat service calls, and therefore, more satisfied customers. It was developed by <strong class="colored-text">Motorola</strong> in 1986 and emphasized cycle-time improvement and the reduction of defects. This process has shown to be a powerful way of improving business efficiency and effectiveness. As organizations continue to modify and update their processes for optimal productivity, they must be flexible. As of 2017, LSS had developed into a business management way of thinking that focused on customer needs, customer retention, and improvement of business products and services. There are many establishments, including Motorola, that now do LSS training. There are certifications including white belt, yellow belt, green belt, black belt, and master black belt. The belts signify an employee’s knowledge regarding LSS. For example, a white belt understands the terminology, structure, and idea of LSS and reports issues to green or black belts. A green belt typically manages LSS projects, and a master black belt works with upper-level management to find the areas in the business where LSS needs to be implemented, leads several LSS teams, and oversees implementation of those projects.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm212625280"><span data-type="term">Kaizen</span> (Japanese for <em data-effect="italics">change for the better</em>) is another process that is often linked to Six Sigma (<a href="#auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_OSX_Acct_M01_05_Kaizen" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The two concepts are often used together for process improvements, as they both are designed for continuous improvement by eliminating waste and increasing efficiencies. The concept of <em data-effect="italics">kaizen</em> comes from an ancient Japanese philosophy that involves continuously working toward perfection in all areas of one’s life. It was adopted in the business world after World War II in an effort to rebuild Japan. It centers on making small, day-to-day changes that develop into major improvements over time. The key behind the success of kaizen comes from requiring all employees—from the CEO at the top, all the way down to the shop-floor janitors—to participate by making recommendations to improve the organization. From the start of the process, it must be well defined that all recommendations are appreciated and that there will be no adverse results for participating. Workers, instead, should be rewarded for any modifications that advance the workplace. Employees become more self-assured and invested when they help improve the company.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm235396368">Another lean practice, the <span data-type="term">theory of constraints (TOC)</span>, involves recognizing and removing bottlenecks within the value chain that may be limiting an organization’s profitability. This philosophy, developed by Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt, is a valuable instrument for improving the flaws in processes. The main goal of this methodology is to remove obstructions, or constraints, which are referred to as “bottlenecks.” There are several types of bottlenecks that organizations must deal with endlessly. One example occurs at the grocery store when it is crowded and there are only three checkout lanes open but ten people in each line. Obviously, the bottleneck is created by having too few checkout lanes open. The bottleneck can be mitigated by opening more checkout lanes.

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm234436608">The <span data-type="term">balanced scorecard (BSC)</span> approach uses both financial and nonfinancial measures in evaluating all attributes of the organization’s procedures. This approach differs from the traditional approach of only using financial measures to evaluate a company. While financial measures are essential, they are only a portion of what needs to be evaluated. The balanced scorecard focuses on both high-level and low-level measures, using the company’s own strategic plan. This method assesses the organization in four separate perspectives:</p>
<ul id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm234188192" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>Financial. The financial measures are the major focus of the BSC—but not the only measures. This perspective asks questions like whether the organization is making money or whether the stockholders are pleased.</li>
<li>Customer. The BSC also evaluates how the organization is perceived, from the customer’s perspective. This measures customer satisfaction, new customer growth, and market share.</li>
<li>Internal process. The internal procedures and processes perspective observes how smoothly things are running. This perspective will examine quality, efficiency, and waste as they relate directly to the products or services.</li>
<li>Learning and growth/capacity. This area evaluates the entity and its performance from the standpoint of human capital, infrastructure, culture, technology, and other areas. Are employees collaborating and sharing information? Does everyone have access to the latest trends in training and continuing education in their areas?</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm212671264">The main advantage of this approach is that it offers organizations a way to see the cause-and-effect in the objectives. For example, if an organization would like to make more money in order to pay higher dividends to its stockholders, the organization will need to increase market share, improve customer satisfaction, or grow its customer base. In order to make customers happier or gain new customers, the organization could try to reduce defects and increase overall quality of the products; to accomplish that, the organization could retrain or offer new training to its employees.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm231006624"><h3 data-type="title">Globalization</h3>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm235478544">The development of business through international influence or extending social and cultural aspects around the world is known as <span data-type="term">globalization</span>. It has expanded our competitive borders, giving customers more alternatives. Customers can order an item from another country with the click of a button and have that item delivered in a few days or less. How has globalization affected companies? Not only must they choose between ordering goods or components globally, but they must decide in which countries to sell their goods, and in which companies they may be able to establish factories.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm200140272">Globalization affects management accountants in several ways. Companies need real-time, accurate information to make good decisions, so more timely and accurate information is needed. As companies expand globally, managers need to know the cost of operating internationally, as well as the laws, rules, and customs. Globalization also can expose companies to improvements in running a business.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm200139472">Debates continue as to the positive and negative consequences of globalization in all of its contexts. The advantages of globalization include helping developing countries in creating jobs, developing industries, differentiating and expanding their markets, and bettering their standard of living for their citizens. Some believe the expansion of pop culture around the globe to be an advantage of cultural globalization. It has multiplied the interchange of ideas, music, art, language, and cultural ideals. On the other side of the debate, one common criticism of globalization is that it has enhanced wealth disparity and, further, that organizations of the Western world have benefited much more than those anywhere else. There is also the argument that globalization is improving standards of living worldwide as industrialization is expanding, but it is causing global warming and climate change, due to the greenhouse gases the factories emit. Additionally, in some areas it has led to the abuse and misuse of natural resources and caused other detrimental consequences.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm231055200">How do these various globalization debates affect businesses? A successful company must be profitable to stay in business, but profitability is not the single key to success. A successful company must also consider the environment in which it operates—culturally, socially, environmentally, and economically—which requires companies to evolve and adjust as each of these environments changes. This evolution means that companies must continually evaluate themselves and their impact on all of their stakeholders, which include investors, creditors, management, employees, customers, governments, and, either directly or indirectly, the world. What companies used as measures of success forty years ago are different from the measures used twenty years ago, and those are different from those that are used today and still different from what will be needed in the future. Management accounting is the area in which many of these changing measures are either generated or evaluated. Such measures not only evaluate the cost effectiveness of products or services, but determine the best way to evaluate and reward employees and evaluate the cost-benefit of environmental protections, the impact of automation versus outsourcing, and the cost of training and educating employees.</p>

Ethics are the principles, and the values that underlie them, that allow us to determine what is right and wrong. According to Gerasimova, ethics fall into three categories: “code and compliance, destiny and values, and social outreach.”<a href="#auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm235280592" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a> In the global business context, she also emphasizes the importance of respecting differences in values held by coworkers, communicating honestly in business dealings, and building trust. To assist in the application of the organization’s ethical approach to doing business in a different culture, it needs to develop a set of “core values as the basis for global policies and decision-making.”<a href="#auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm247643632" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a> Gerasimova notes that organizations also need to consider that “clients and coworkers may have a different perspective on ethics and proper behavior than those to which you are accustomed.” To address the different perspectives, an organization should train its employees to be culturally sensitive while balancing the need for rules and policies with the ability for employees to be flexible and to use their imagination.</p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm235280592">Kate Gerasimova. “The Critical Role of Ethics and Culture in Business Globalization.” <em data-effect="italics">Business to Community</em>.

Although the causes and cures of climate change are open to discussion, most will agree that everyone, including corporations, should do their part to avoid further damage and improve any negative impact on the environment.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm218445440">As <strong class="colored-text">New Belgium Brewing Company</strong> states on their website: “We’re New Belgium and we pollute. There. We said it. We are not perfect and we know it.” But New Belgium Brewing has become a leader in sustainability. They preach it in every aspect of the company: production, marketing, employees, and customers. The company makes the point that being energy efficient is not only being environmentally responsible, it is being financially responsible through their “internal energy efficiency tax.” The company uses many different metrics to track and improve its impact on the environment. For example, the company measures its energy usage and taxes itself on energy consumption and then saves those internal tax dollars to implement further energy savings by installing new processes and techniques. They divert 99.9 percent of the waste from their brewery away from landfills. The company makes enough in recycling revenues to pay four salaries. These are just a few ways in which New Belgium Brewing faces the challenges of social responsibility. Read more at http://www.newbelgium.com/Sustainability/Environmental-Metrics.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm240701296">In late 2016, the Paris Agreement (Paris Accord) brought together nations for the common cause of combatting climate change. There were 197 nations in attendance, and until recently, all 197 ratified or agreed to the effort. It requires all partners to pursue specific endeavors to keep the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above that of preindustrial levels. This would be accomplished by voluntarily reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In early 2017, US President Donald Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the agreement. At that time, only Syria and Nicaragua were holdouts. Since then, both have signed the agreement, leaving the United States now as the lone holdout, although it will take several years for the formal withdrawal. In spite of the president’s announcement, there have been representatives from cities, states, corporations, and universities around the United States that have pledged to continue with the agreement and meet the greenhouse gas emission targets as set out in the Paris Accord. Many of the corporations who have promised to move forward with reducing greenhouse gases have expressed that the Paris Accord expands markets for groundbreaking clean technologies and that it creates employment opportunities alongside economic growth.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm236755984">In terms of managerial accounting, sustainable business practices create many issues. Organizations need to decide what elements will be measured. For example, minimizing electricity consumption, maximizing employee safety, or reducing greenhouse gases may be the biggest issue of concern for a company. Then, the company needs to determine ways of measurement that make sense regarding those items. Companies are becoming more aware of their impact on the world, and many are creating social responsibility reports in addition to their annual reports. This type of reporting requires different types of information and analysis than the typical financial measures gathered by companies. This is sometimes referred to as the <em data-effect="italics">triple bottom line</em>, as it assesses an organization’s performance not only relating to the profit, but also relating to the world and its people, and will be covered in <a href="#page_8292e223-4463-4e99-944c-87d1f80b7708">Sustainability Reporting</a>.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm190469040">Zaley is an aerospace manufacturing firm in the southwest United States. They manufacture several products used in the aviation and aerospace industry. The company has been steadily growing over the past ten years in both sales and personnel. The engineering and design team uses computerized aided drafting (CAD) to design the various products that are produced by the machining division.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm190468256">The machining division recently implemented significant technological improvements by installing an advanced technique using hard-metal and aluminum high-speed machining. The following managers are involved with the machining division:</p>
<ul id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm190467872" data-bullet-style="bullet">

<ul id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm240462960" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>Alex Freeman, technical specialist (supervises all computer programs), needs information on the hours and type of usage possibly by department or by individual to ascertain if the equipment is being used effectively or if the programs used by the company are appropriate or additions or deletions need to be made. In addition, this information is needed to address how much and what type of staffing he needs in his department.</li>
<li>Emma Vlovski, sales manager (supervises all sales agents), would want information about the level and type of sales for the company as a whole as well as for the individual sales agents. She would want to know which products are selling well, which ones are not, which sales agents are being the most successful, and why they are more successful than the others. Emma would also want information on how the agents are compensated, as this may be tied to the sales agent’s efforts to meet sales goals.</li>
<li>Kayla McClaughley, cost accounting director (supervises all cost accountants), would want to know what tasks the cost accountants perform, how much time they spend on these tasks, and whether there are any redundancies in workload so that improvements in efficiency can be made. If any of the accountants has certifications such as CPA or CMA, she would want to know if they are keeping their certifications current through continuing professional education.</li>
<li>Mwangi Kori, lead test engineer (oversees all new-product testing and design), would need information on the efficiency and effectiveness of each of the products tested, including success and failure rates. She would want information on how well the policies and procedures for design changes are being followed and if those policies and procedures need updating or rewriting.</li>
<li>Thomas Sanchez, production director (supervises all manufacturing employees), would want information on hours worked, pay rates, and training (past and ongoing) for the manufacturing employees. She would also want information on how each individual employee performs his or her role in the manufacturing environment. For example, are there particular employees who have fewer defects or down time in their part of the process than others?</li>

<li>Business regulations are always being altered, global competition continues to increase, and technology provides continual disruption. Management accounting must keep up with the changes in the business environment.</li>
<li>The fundamental difference between manufacturing organizations and service-based firms is whether the organizations produce a tangible product.</li>
<li>Business entities have been in the lead for using technology, but they must continue to adjust quickly with the ever-advancing business technology.</li>
<li>ERP systems help companies streamline their operations and help management respond quickly to change.</li>
<li>Lean manufacturing, which was started in Japan by automakers, is now a widely used practice that attempts to increase productivity and eliminate waste.</li>
<li>The philosophy of continuous improvement has led organizations to adopt practices such as TQM, JIT manufacturing, and LSS.</li>
<li>The balanced scorecard approach uses both financial and nonfinancial measures in evaluating all attributes of the organization’s procedures.</li>
<li>Globalization has expanded competitive borders, giving customers and companies more alternatives.</li>
<li>Many companies have started to assess their corporation not only on financial profits, but also on their corporate social responsibility.</li>

<p id="auto_a152a670-dd02-4e88-81e1-f69483664a8a_fs-idm239636816">One day, at your part-time job in a local coffee shop, you realize that the employees throw many pounds of used coffee grounds in the trash each day. From an environmental perspective, you are concerned because of the volume of trash being transferred to the landfill. From a business perspective, you wonder if discarding the used grounds is the only option. Could those coffee grounds be used in a profitable manner? After a bit of research, you discover that, if prepared in certain ways, used coffee grounds are good as fertilizer, can kill insects on some plants, can be used as a body scrub, among other options. A recent radio talk show discussed the possibility that coffee grounds could be used as an alternative fuel source, and you learned that coffee grounds are actually being used to help fuel buses in London.</p>

<p id="auto_a152a670-dd02-4e88-81e1-f69483664a8a_fs-idm237012480">You consider the options for the used coffee grounds and come up with three possibilities for your coffee shop: (1) throw away the used grounds; (2) sell the used grounds to a company that will process them into fertilizer, bio-fuel, or some other product; or (3) process and package the used grounds for resale in the coffee shop as fertilizer and bug repellant. What information would you need for your analysis? Which decision would you choose and why? Are the revenue and cost components the only components of the decision that you should consider? These and similar issues are the types of questions that the accounting analysis process can help management address when evaluating short-term decisions.</p>

<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm194761072">Almost everything we do in life results from choosing between alternatives, and the choices we make result in different consequences. For example, when choosing whether or not to eat breakfast before going to class, you face two alternatives and two sets of consequences. Eating breakfast means you must get up a little earlier, have food available, and be willing to prepare the food. Not eating means sleeping in longer, not having to plan food, and being hungry during class. Just as our lives are fraught with decisions large and small, the same is true for businesses. Almost every aspect of being in business involves choosing between alternatives, and each alternative typically has one or more consequences. Understanding how businesses make decisions paves the way not only to better decision-making processes but potentially to better outcomes.</p>

<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm200929792">Decisions made by businesses can have short-term effects or long-term impacts, or in some situations, both. Short-term decisions often address a temporary circumstance or an immediate need while long-term decisions align more with permanent problem solving and meeting strategic goals. Because these two types of decisions require different types of analyses, we will consider short-term decision-making here and long-term decision-making in <a href="#page_eb8bf905-22dc-4fad-9852-f579f449dea8">Capital Budgeting Decision</a>. Accounting distinguishes between short-term and long-term decisions not only because of the difference in the general nature of these decisions but also because the types of analyses differ significantly between short-term and long-term decision categories. As the time horizon over which the decision will have an impact expands, more costs become relevant to the decision-making process. In addition, when a time element is considered, there will be additional factors such as interest (paid or received) that will have a greater influence on decisions. <a href="#auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm187816496" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> provides examples of short-term and long-term business decisions.</p>

<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm198121184">Considering the business challenges facing <strong class="colored-text">Gearhead Outfitters</strong>, what short-term decisions might the company encounter? Remember that the retailer sells men’s, women’s and children’s outdoor clothing, footwear, and accessories. <strong class="colored-text">Gearhead</strong> must carry a certain level and variety of inventory to meet the demands of its customers. The company will have to maintain appropriate accounting records to make proper business decisions to promote sustainability and growth.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm194743376">How might <strong class="colored-text">Gearhead</strong> be able to compete with larger chains and remain profitable? Will every sale result in the anticipated profit to the company? Consider what specialized short-term decision-making processes the company may use to meet its goals. Should more of an item than normal be purchased for resale to receive a larger discount from the supplier? What information about cost, volume, and profit is needed to make a sound business decision in this case? Some items may be sold at a loss (or lesser profit) to attract customers to the store. What type of information and accounting system is needed to help in this situation? The company requires relevant, consistent, and reliable data to determine the proper course of action.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm203818544">Short-term decision-making is vital in any business. Consider this concept in relation to <a href="#page_828a89f3-62c4-4d96-8ee9-88997b69bceb">Centralized vs. Decentralized Management</a> and how a company’s approach may affect the decision-making process. Discuss possible short-term issues and decisions, management focuses, and whether or not the centralized versus decentralized style will aid in company flexibility and success. Also, think in terms of how the decision-making process will be evaluated.</p></div>

<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm221125008">Business decision-making can be outlined as a process that is applied by management with each decision that is made. The process of decision-making in a managerial business environment can be summed up in these steps.</p>
<ol id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm206707120" type="1">
<li>Identify the objective or goal. For a business, typically the goal is to maximize revenues or minimize costs.</li>
<li>Identify alternative courses of action that can achieve the goal or address an obstacle that is hindering goal achievement.</li>
<li>Perform a comprehensive analysis of potential solutions. This includes identifying revenues, costs, benefits, and other financial and qualitative variables.</li>
<li>Decide, based upon the analysis, the best course of action.</li>
<li>Review, analyze, and evaluate the results of the decision.</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm196648976">The first step of the decision-making process is to identify the goal. In the decisions discussed in this course, the quantitative goal will either be to maximize revenues or to minimize costs. The second step is to identify the alternative courses of action to achieve the goal. (In the real world, steps one and two may require more thought and research that you will learn about in advanced cost accounting and management courses.). This chapter focuses on steps three and four, which involve <span data-type="term">short-term decision analysis</span>: determining the appropriate information necessary for making a decision that will impact the company in the short term, usually 12 months or fewer, and using that information in a proper analysis in order to reach an informed decision among alternatives. Step five, which involves reviewing and evaluating the decision, is briefly addressed with each type of decision analyzed.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm208708368">Though these same general steps could be used in long-term decision analyses, the nature of long-term decisions is different. Short-term decisions are typically operational in nature: making versus buying a component of a product, using scarce resources, selling a product as-is or processing it further into a different product. It is relatively easy to change a short-term decision with minimal impact on the company. Long-term decisions are strategic in nature and typically involve large sums of money. The effects of a long-term decision can have significant financial impact on a company for years. Examples of long-term decisions include replacing manufacturing equipment, building a new factory, or deciding to eliminate a product line. While you’ve learned how managerial accounting classifies, tracks, monitors, and controls costs, managerial accountants also closely analyze revenues, which are less controllable than costs, but are important in these decisions. As stated in the first step of the decision-making process, maximizing revenues is usually one of the goals of an organization. Therefore, making some short-term decisions requires analysis of both costs and revenues.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm197983888">In carrying out step three of the managerial decision-making process, a differential analysis compares the relevant costs and revenues of potential solutions. What does this involve? First, it is important to understand that there are many types of short-term decisions that a business may face, but these decisions always involve choosing between alternatives. Examples of these types of decisions include determining whether to accept a special order; making a product or component versus buying the product or component; performing additional processing on a product; keeping versus eliminating a product or segment; or determining whether to take on a new project. In each of these situations, the business should compare the relevant costs and the relevant revenues of one alternative to the relevant costs and relevant revenues of the other alternative(s). Therefore, an important step in the differential analysis of potential solutions is to identify the relevant costs and relevant revenues of the decision.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm199993824">What does it mean for something to be relevant? In the context of decision-making, something is relevant if it will influence the decision being made. For example, suppose you have two options for a summer job—either flagging traffic for a road crew or working for a landscaping company doing lawn care. For either job, you will be required to have industrial grade sound protectors (plugs or headphones) for your ears. This cost would not be relevant because it is the same under either alternative, so it will not influence your decision between the two jobs; it would be considered an <span data-type="term">irrelevant cost</span>. You also believe your transportation costs will be the same for either job; thus this would also be an irrelevant cost.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm210368880">However, if you are required to have steel-toed boots for the road work job but can wear any type of work boot for the landscaping job, you would need to consider the difference between the costs, or the <span data-type="term">differential cost</span>, of these two types of boots. This difference in cost between the two pairs of boots would be designated as a <span data-type="term">relevant cost</span> because it influences your decision.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm219240800">The two jobs also may have differences in revenues, called a <span data-type="term">differential revenue</span>. Because the differential revenue influences the decision, it is also a <span data-type="term">relevant revenue</span>. If both jobs pay the same hourly wage, it would have an <span data-type="term">irrelevant revenue</span>, but if the road crew job offers overtime for any time worked over 40 hours, then this overtime wage has the potential to be a relevant revenue if overtime is a likely occurrence. Looking only at these differences—of both costs and revenues—between the alternatives, is known as <span data-type="term">differential analysis</span>.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm217722432">In conducting these types of analyses between alternatives, the initial focus will be on each <span data-type="term">quantitative factor</span> of the analysis—in other words, the component that can be measured numerically. Examples of quantitative factors in business include sales growth, number of defective parts produced, or number of labor hours worked. However, in decision-making, it is important also to consider each <span data-type="term">qualitative factor</span>, which is one that cannot be measured numerically. For example, using the same summer job scenario, qualitative factors may include the environment in which you would be working (road dust and tar odors versus pollen and mower exhaust fumes), the amount of time exposed to the sun, the people with whom you will be working (working with friends versus making new friends), and weather-related issues (both jobs are outdoors, but could one job send you home for the day due to weather?). Examples of qualitative factors in business include employee morale, customer satisfaction, and company or brand image. In making short-term decisions, a business will want to analyze both qualitative and quantitative factors.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm199594848">In short-term decision-making, revenues are often easier to evaluate than costs. In addition, each alternative typically only has one possible one revenue outcome even though there are many costs to consider for each alternative. How do we know if a cost will have an impact on the decision? The starting point is to understand the various labels that are attached to costs in these decision-making environments.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm203554000"><h4 data-type="title">Avoidable versus Unavoidable Costs</h4>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm200703312">Management must determine if a cost is avoidable or unavoidable because in the short run, only avoidable costs are relevant for decision-making purposes. An <span data-type="term">avoidable cost</span> is one that can be eliminated (in whole or in part) by choosing one alternative over another. For example, assume that a bike shop offers their customers custom paint jobs for bikes that the customers already own. If they eliminate the service, the cost of the bike paint could be eliminated. Also assume that they had been employing a part-time painter to do the work. The painter’s compensation would also be an avoidable cost.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm208671616">An <span data-type="term">unavoidable cost</span> is one that does not change or go away in the short-run by choosing one alternative over another. For example, a company might sign a long-term lease on equipment or a production facility. These types of leases typically don’t allow for cancellation, so if this one does not, then their required payments are unavoidable costs for the duration of the lease.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm194616560"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Variable costs</span> are avoidable costs, since variable costs do not exist if the product is no longer made, or if the portion of the business (such as a segment or division) that generated the variable costs ceases to operate. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Fixed costs</span>, on the other hand, may be unavoidable, partially unavoidable, or avoidable only in certain circumstances. Remember that fixed costs tend to remain constant for a period of time and within a relevant range of production and are not easily eliminated in the short-run. Therefore, most fixed costs also are unavoidable. If a fixed cost is specific only to one of the alternatives, then that fixed cost also may be avoidable. Avoidable costs are future costs that are relevant to decision-making. Past costs are never an avoidable cost.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm216887824">Recall that we are using a short-term viewpoint to determine whether or not costs are avoidable. In the long run, virtually all costs are avoidable. For example, assume that a company has a long-term, ten-year lease on a production facility that cannot be cancelled. For the first ten years it would be noncancelable and thus unavoidable. But after ten years it would become avoidable.</p>

Annual sales have been 100,000 wagons per year. The retail selling price of each wagon is $67.00. To date, AlexCo has produced each of the components used in making the wagons but has been approached by DAL, Inc. with an offer to provide the axle and wheel assembly for $18.75 per assembly. AlexCo’s costs to produce the axle and wheel assembly are $9.00 in direct materials, $6.50 in direct labor, $3.57 in variable overhead, and $2.50 in fixed overhead. Twenty-five percent of the fixed overhead is avoidable if the assembly is produced by DAL. Should AlexCo continue to make the axle and wheel assembly or should it buy the assembly from DAL, Inc.?</p>

<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm224197872">A <span data-type="term">sunk cost</span> is one that cannot be avoided because it has already occurred. A sunk cost will not change regardless of the alternative that management chooses; therefore, sunk costs have no bearing on future events and are not relevant in decision-making. The basic premise sounds simple enough, but sunk costs are difficult to ignore due to human nature and are sometimes incorrectly included in the decision-making process. For example, suppose you have an old car, a hand-me-down from your grandmother, and last year you spent $1,600 on repairs and new tires and were just told by your mechanic that the car needs $1,200 in repairs to operate safely. Your goal is to have a safe and reliable car. Your alternatives are to get the repairs completed or trade in the car for a newer used car.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm201037984">From a quantitative perspective, you have gathered the following information to help with your decision. The trade-in value of your old car will be the minimum given by the dealer, or $200. The newer used car will require you to make monthly payments of $150 for two years. In analyzing your two alternatives, what costs do you consider? Remember, the $1,600 you have already spent (note the past tense) is a sunk cost; it is a consequence of a past decision. In this example, the relevant costs for each alternative are the following: $1,200 in current repair costs to keep your current car or $3,400 (from the 24 payments of $150 minus $200 for the trade in) to buy a newer used car. Obviously, you also would consider qualitative factors, such as the sentimental value of your grandmother’s car or the excitement of having a newer car.</p>
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm200883424">Sunk costs are most problematic for business decisions when they pertain to existing equipment. The book value of an asset (historical cost – accumulated depreciation) is a sunk cost regardless of whether a business keeps the asset or disposes of it in some manner. The cost of the asset occurred in the past and therefore is sunk and irrelevant to the decision at hand. Mangers may be reluctant to ignore sunk costs when making decisions, especially if the prior decision to purchase the asset was an unwise one. Often, when management takes a path of action that is not achieving the desired results, managers may continue the same path in the hope that the effect of prior decisions will improve the results. The use of the word <em data-effect="italics">prior</em> is a key indicator that information is nonrelevant to a current decision. Holding on to old decisions or old commitments is common because letting them go forces management to admit they made a bad decision.</p>

<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm210746288">Any future cost that does not differ between the alternatives is not a relevant cost for the decision. For example, if a company is considering baking either bagels or doughnuts and both baked goods require $0.30 worth of flour, then the cost of flour would not be a relevant cost in determining which of the two had the highest production cost. As relevant information for short-term decision-making, the cost of sound protectors for your summer job would not be relevant to your decision because that cost exists in both scenarios. Another irrelevant cost would be your transportation cost, since that cost is also the same regardless of the job you choose. In another example, if a company is planning to produce either red widgets or blue wingdings and will need to hire 10 additional employees to produce either of the goods, the cost of those 10 employees is irrelevant because it does not differ between the alternatives.</p>

Each college student would work half days totaling 20 hours per week, and would earn $12 per hour. The full-time employee would work full days 40 hours per week and would earn $12 per hour plus the equivalent of $2 per hour in benefits. Each employee is given two t-shirts to wear as their uniform.

<li>Decision-making involves choosing between alternatives.</li>
<li>A critical step in the decision-making process is identification of all the relevant information for each alternative. Relevant information is any information that would have an impact on the decision.</li>
<li>Relevant information can come in the form of costs or revenues, or be nonfinancial in form. For information regarding costs, this means determining which costs are avoidable and which are unavoidable.</li>

<div data-type="solution" id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm199928096">
<p id="auto_1eff3b98-4a77-44a2-b619-53604e12797a_fs-idm219832640">Primarily disagree, but there are a few times where fixed costs can be avoided or partially avoided. Variable costs are avoidable costs since variable costs do not exist if the product is no longer made, or if the portion of the business (such as a segment or division) that generated the variable costs ceases to operate. Fixed costs, on the other hand, may be unavoidable, partially unavoidable, or avoidable only in certain circumstances. When a company discontinues a product or service, certain fixed costs may not be required.</p>

Due to the steep learning curve required to use the new software, Garrison must decide between hiring two part-time college students or one full-time employee. Each college student would work 20 hours per week, and would earn $15 per hour. The full-time employee would work 40 hours per week and would earn $15 per hour plus the equivalent of $2 per hour in benefits. Employees are given two polo shirts to wear as their uniform.

<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm195632384">Both manufacturing and service companies often receive requests to fill special orders. These <span data-type="term">special orders</span> are typically for goods or services at a reduced price and are usually a one-time order that, in the short-run, does not affect normal sales. When deciding whether to accept a special order, management must consider several factors:</p>

<ul id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm183071968">
<li>The capacity required to fulfill the special order</li>
<li>Whether the price offered by the buyer will cover the cost of producing the products</li>
<li>The role of fixed costs in the analysis</li>
<li>Qualitative factors</li>
<li>Whether the order will violate the Robinson-Patman Act and other fair pricing legislation</li>
</ul>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm177194016"><h3 data-type="title">Fundamentals of the Decision to Accept or Reject a Special Order</h3>
<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm188571216">The starting point for making this decision is to assess the company’s normal production capacity. The <span data-type="term">normal capacity</span> is the production level a company can achieve without adding additional production resources, such as additional equipment or labor. For example, if the company can produce 10,000 towels a month based on its current production capacity, and it is currently contracted to produce 9,000 a month, it could not take on a special one-time order for 3,000 towels without adding additional equipment or workers. Most companies do not work at maximum capacity; rather, they function at normal capacity, which is a concept related to a company’s relevant range. The <span data-type="term">relevant range</span> is the quantitative range of units that can be produced based on the company’s current productive assets. These assets can include equipment capacity or its labor capacity. Labor capacity is typically easier to increase on a short-term basis than equipment capacity. The following example assumes that labor capacity is available, so only equipment capacity is considered in the example.</p>
<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm177299856">Assume that based on a company’s present equipment, it can produce 20,000 units a month. Its relevant range of production would be zero to 20,000 units a month. As long as the units of production fall within this range, it does not need additional equipment. However, if it wanted to increase production from 20,000 units to 24,000 units, it would need to buy or lease additional equipment. If production is fewer than 20,000 units, the company would have unused capacity that could be used to produce additional units for its current customers or for new clients.</p>
<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm192042656">If the company does not have the capacity to produce a special order, it will have to reduce production of another good or service in order to fulfill the special order or provide another means of producing the goods, such as hiring temporary workers, running an additional shift, or securing additional equipment. As you will learn, not having the capacity to fill the special order will create a different analysis than it would if there is sufficient capacity.</p>
<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm209799904">Next, management must determine if the price offered by the buyer will result in enough revenue to cover the differential costs of producing the items. For example, if price does not meet the variable costs of production, then accepting the special order would be an unprofitable decision.</p>
<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm203395312">Additionally, fixed costs may be relevant if the company is already operating at capacity, as there may be additional fixed costs, such as the need to run an extra shift, hire an additional supervisor, or buy or lease additional equipment. If the company is not operating at capacity—in other words, the company has <em data-effect="italics">unused</em> capacity—then the fixed costs are irrelevant to the decision if the special order can be met with this unused capacity.</p>
<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm177461296">Special orders create several qualitative issues. A logical issue is the concern for how existing customers will feel if they discover a lower price was offered to the special-order customer. A special order that might be profitable could be rejected if the company determined that accepting the special order could damage relations with current customers. If the goods in the special order are modified so that they are cheaper to manufacture, current customers may prefer the modified, cheaper version of the product. Would this hurt the profitability of the company? Would it affect the reputation?</p>
<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm187836304">In addition to these considerations, sometimes companies will take on a special order that will not cover costs based on qualitative assessments. For example, the business requesting the special order might be a potential client with whom the manufacturer has been trying to establish a business relationship and the producer is willing to take a one-time loss. However, our coverage of special orders concentrates on decisions based on quantitative factors.</p>
<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm195504304">Companies considering special orders must also be aware of the anti–price discrimination rules established in the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Robinson-Patman Act</span>. The Robinson-Patman Act is a federal law that was passed in 1936. Its primary intent is to prevent some forms of price discrimination in sales transactions between smaller and larger businesses.</p>

<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm196420768">The Robinson-Patman Act prevents large retailers from purchasing goods in bulk at a greater discount than smaller retailers are able to obtain them.

<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm200653488">Franco, Inc., produces dental office examination chairs. Franco has the capacity to produce 5,000 chairs per year and currently is producing 4,000. Each chair retails for $2,800, and the costs to produce a single chair consist of direct materials of $750, direct labor of $600, and variable overhead of $300. Fixed overhead costs of $1,350,000 are met by selling the first 3,000 chairs. Franco has received a special order from Ghanem, Inc., to buy 800 chairs for $1,800. Should Franco accept the special order?</p>

Additionally, all the fixed costs have already been met. Therefore, when evaluating the special order, Franco must determine if the special offer price will meet and exceed the costs to produce the chairs. <a href="#auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_OSX_Acct_M10_02_SpecOrd01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> details the analysis.</p>

<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm196439376">Since Franco has already met his fixed costs with current production and since he has the capacity to produce the additional 800 units, Franco only needs to consider his variable costs for this order. Franco’s variable cost to produce one chair is $1,650. Ghanem is offering to buy the chairs for $1,800 apiece. By accepting the special order, Franco would meet his variable costs and make $150 per chair. Considering only quantitative factors, Franco should accept the special offer.</p>
<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm198694112">How would Franco’s decision change if the factory was already producing at capacity at the time of the special offer? In other words, assume the corporation is already producing the most it can produce without working more hours or adding more equipment. Accepting the order would likely mean that Franco would incur additional fixed costs. Assume that, to fill the order from Ghanem, Franco would have to run an extra shift, and this would require him to hire a temporary production manager at a cost of $90,000. Assume no other fixed costs would be incurred. Also assume Franco will incur additional costs related to maintenance and utilities for this extra shift and estimates those costs will be $70,000. As shown in <a href="#auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_OSX_Acct_M10_02_SpecOrd02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, in this scenario, Franco would have to charge Ghanem at least $1,850 in order to meet his cost.</p>

<p id="auto_7206ee7f-3ca5-49b9-8e2a-1d515c16927c_fs-idm201040512">The analysis of Franco’s options did not consider any qualitative factors, such as the impact on morale if the company is already at capacity and opts to implement overtime or hire temporary workers to fill the special order. The analysis also does not consider the effect on regular customers if management elects to meet the special order by not fulfilling some of the regular orders. Another consideration is the impact on existing customers if the price offered for the special order is lower than the regular price. These effects may create a bad dynamic between the company and its customers, or they may cause customers to seek products from competitors. As in the example, Franco would need to consider the impact of displacing other customers and the risk of losing business from regular customers, such as dental supply companies, if he is unable to meet their orders. The next step is to do an overall cost/benefit analysis in which Franco would consider not only the quantitative but the qualitative factors before making his final decision on whether or not to accept the special order.</p>

Based on this information, what is the differential income (loss) associated with accepting the special order?</p>

<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm222731472">One of the most common outsourcing scenarios is one in which a company must decide whether it is going to make a component that it needs in manufacturing a product or buy that component already made. For example, all of the components of the iPhone are made by companies other than <strong class="colored-text">Apple</strong>. <strong class="colored-text">Ford</strong> buys truck and automobile seats, as well as many other components and individual parts, from various suppliers and then assembles them at <strong class="colored-text">Ford</strong> factories. With each component, <strong class="colored-text">Ford</strong> must decide if it is more cost effective to make that component internally or to buy that component from an external supplier.</p>

<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm235961936">This type of analysis is also relevant to the service industry; for example, <strong class="colored-text">ADP</strong> provides payroll and data processing services to over 650,000 companies worldwide. Or a law firm may decide to hire certain research activities to be completed by outside experts rather than hire the necessary staff to keep that function in-house. These are all examples of outsourcing. <span data-type="term">Outsourcing</span> is the act of using another company to provide goods or services that your company requires.</p>

<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm245398320">Many companies outsource some of their work, but why? Consider this scenario: Today, while driving home from class, one of your car’s engine warning lights goes on. You will most likely take your car to an auto repair specialist to have it analyzed and repaired, whereas your grandfather might have popped the hood, grabbed his toolbox, and attempted to diagnose and fix the problem himself. Why? It is often a matter of expertise and sometimes simply a matter of cost benefit. In your grandfather’s time, car engines were more mechanical and less electronic, which made learning to repair cars a simpler process that required less expertise and only basic tools. Today, your car has many electronic components and often requires sophisticated monitors to assess the problem and may involve the replacement of computer chips or electronic sensors. Thus, you opt to outsource the repair of your car to someone who has the knowledge and facilities to provide the repair more cost effectively than you could if you did it yourself. Your grandfather likely could have made the repair to his car several decades ago as cheaply as the mechanic with only a sacrifice of his time. To your grandfather, the cost of his time was worth the benefit of completing the repair himself.</p>

<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm241245872">Companies outsource for the same reasons. Many companies have found that it is more cost effective to outsource certain activities, such as payroll, data storage, and web design and hosting. It is more efficient to pay an outside expert than to hire the appropriate staff to keep a particular task inside the company.</p>

<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm212628352">As with other decisions, the make-versus-buy decision involves both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The quantitative component requires cost analysis to determine which alternative is more cost effective. This cost analysis can be performed by looking at the cost to buy the component versus the cost to produce the component, which allows us to make a decision based on an analysis of unavoidable costs. For example, the costs to produce will include direct materials, direct labor, variable overhead, and fixed overhead. If the business chooses to buy the component instead, the avoidable costs will go away but unavoidable costs will remain and would need to be considered as part of the cost to buy the component.</p>

<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm239780848">Thermal Mugs, Inc., manufactures various types of leak-proof personal drink carriers. Thermal’s T6 container, its most insulated carrier, maintains the temperature of the liquid inside for 6 hours. Thermal has designed a new lid for the T6 carrier that allows for easier drinking and pouring. The cost to produce the new lid is $2.19:</p>

<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm212489040">Plato Plastics has approached Thermal and offered to produce the 120,000 lids Thermal will require for current production levels of the T6 carrier, at a unit price of $1.75 each. Is this a good deal? Should Thermal buy the lids from Plato rather than produce them themselves? Initially, the $1.75 presented by Plato seems like a much better price than the $2.19 that it would cost Thermal to produce the lids. However, more information about the relevant costs is necessary to determine whether the offer by Plato is the better offer. Remember that all the variable costs of producing the lid will only exist if the lid is produced by Thermal, thus the variable costs (direct materials, direct labor, and variable overhead) are all relevant costs that will differ between the alternatives.</p>
<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm242206144">What about the fixed costs? Assume all the fixed costs are not tied directly to the production of the lid and therefore will still exist even if the lid is purchased externally from Plato. This means the fixed costs of $0.51 per unit are unavoidable and therefore are not relevant.</p>

How would the analysis change if a portion of the fixed costs were avoidable? Suppose that, of the $0.51 in fixed costs per unit of the T6 lid, $0.12 of those fixed costs are associated with interest costs and insurance expenses and thus would be avoidable if the T6 lid is purchased externally rather than produced internally. How does that change the analysis?</p>

<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm236957968">The difference in these two presentations of the data emphasizes the importance of defining which costs are relevant, as improper cost identification can lead to bad decisions.</p>
<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm235168432">These analyses only considered the quantitative factors in a make-versus-buy decision, but there are qualitative factors to consider as well, including:</p>
<ul id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm235202032">
<li>Will the T6 lid made by Plato meet the quality requirements of Thermal?</li>
<li>Will Plato continue to produce the T6 lid at the $1.75 price, or is this a teaser rate to obtain the business, with the plan for the rate to go up in the future?</li>
<li>Can Plato continue to produce the quantity of the lids desired? If more or fewer are needed from Plato, is the adjusted production level obtainable, and does it affect the cost?</li>
<li>Does using Plato to produce the lids displace Thermal workers or hamper morale?</li>
<li>Does using Plato to produce the lids affect the reputation of Thermal?</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm233266896">In addition, if the decision is to buy the lid, Thermal is dependent on Plato for quality, timely delivery, and cost control. If Plato fails to deliver the lids on time, this can negatively affect Thermal’s production and sales. If the lids are of poor quality, returns, replacements, and the damage to Thermal’s reputation can be significant. Without long-term agreements on price increases, Plato can increase the price they charge Thermal, thus making the entire drink container more expensive and less profitable. However, buying the lid likely means that Thermal has excess production capacity that can now be applied to making other products. If Thermal chooses to make the lid, this consumes some of the productive capacity and may affect the relationship Thermal has with the outside supplier if that supplier is already working with Thermal on other products.</p>
<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm212985312">Make versus buy, one of many outsourcing decisions, should involve assessing all relevant costs in conjunction with the qualitative issues that affect the decision or arise because of the choice. Although it may appear that these types of outsourcing decisions are difficult to resolve, companies throughout the world make these decisions daily as part of the company’s strategic plan, and therefore, each company must weigh the advantages and disadvantages of outsourcing production of goods and services.

If there are no qualitative issues that affect the decision and the leasing or purchasing price is less than the relevant (avoidable) costs of producing the good or service in house, the company should outsource the product or service. The following example demonstrates this issue for a service entity.</p>
<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm241361248">Lake Law has ten lawyers on staff who handle workers’ compensation and workplace discrimination lawsuits. Lake has an excellent success rate and frequently wins large settlements for their clients. Because of the size of their settlements, many clients are interested in establishing trusts to manage the investing and distribution of the funds. Lake Law does not have a trust or estate lawyer on staff and is debating between hiring one or using an attorney at a nearby law firm that specializes in wills, trusts, and estates to handle the trusts of Lake’s clients. Hiring a new attorney would require $120,000 in salary for the attorney, an additional 20% in benefits, a legal assistant for the new attorney for 20 hours per week at a cost of $20 per hour, and conversion of a storage room into an office. Lake spent $100,000 on redecorating the offices last year and has sufficient furniture for a new office. The attorney at the nearby firm would charge a retainer of $50,000 plus $200 per hour worked on each trust. The retainer is in addition to the $200 per hour charge for work on trusts. The average trust takes 10 hours to complete and Lake estimates approximately 50 trusts per year. In addition, an external attorney would charge $500 for each trust to cover office expenses and filing fees. Which option should Lake choose?</p>

<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm236460496">Based on the quantitative analysis, Lake should hire an estate attorney to have on staff. For the year, the firm would save $10,200 ($164,800 for internal versus $175,000 with the external attorney) by going with the internal hire. Other potential advantages would be that an in-house attorney could complete more than the estimated 50 trusts without incurring additional costs, and by keeping the work in-house, it helps to build the relationship between the firm and the clients. A disadvantage would be if there is not sufficient work to keep the in-house attorney busy, the company would still have to pay the $120,000 salary plus the additional costs of $44,800 for benefits and the legal assistant’s salary, even if the attorney is working at less than full capacity.</p>

If a U.S. company wants to offshore a service like customer service, for example, what are some of their considerations? In your answer, address offshoring disadvantages as compared with domestic outsourcing.</p>

<p id="auto_d2f82a02-3ed3-4106-9e68-ec571123506e_fs-idm244100464">First and foremost, customer service quality is a consideration, followed closely by the ability of the offshore personnel to speak clearly in English and to understand the customer’s needs. Chief operating officers should also make sure that the call centers are adequately staffed and run in an ethical manner, similar to the main company contracting with the outsourced service. Offshoring disadvantages should be weighed against domestic outsourcing in the areas of time zone problems, politically correct labor choices, rising labor costs abroad, as well as culture and language.</p>

<p id="auto_735ae423-88b2-4bdc-89e6-12ecd357630b_fs-idm364653968">As with other decisions, management must consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects. In choosing between alternatives—that is, in choosing between keeping and eliminating the product, segment, or service—the relevant revenues and costs should be analyzed. Remember that relevant revenues and costs are those that differ between alternatives. Often, the keep-versus-eliminate decision arises because the product or segment appears to be generating less of a profit than in prior periods or is unprofitable. In these situations, the product or segment may produce a positive contribution margin but may appear to have a lower or negative profit because of the allocation of common fixed costs.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_735ae423-88b2-4bdc-89e6-12ecd357630b_fs-idm367298128"><h3 data-type="title">Fundamentals of the Decision to Keep or Discontinue a Segment or Product</h3>
<p id="auto_735ae423-88b2-4bdc-89e6-12ecd357630b_fs-idm363799824">Two basic approaches can be used to analyze data in this type of decision. One approach is to compare contribution margins and fixed costs. In this method, the contribution margins with and without the segment (or division or product line) are determined. The two contribution margins are compared and the alternative with the greatest contribution margin would be the chosen alternative because it provides the biggest contribution toward meeting fixed costs.</p>
<p id="auto_735ae423-88b2-4bdc-89e6-12ecd357630b_fs-idm350117808">The second approach involves calculating the total net income for retaining the segment and comparing it to the total net income for dropping the segment. The company would then proceed with the alternative that has the highest net income. In order to perform these net income calculations, the company would need more information than they would need in order to follow the contribution margin approach, which does not consider the costs and revenues that are the same between the alternatives.</p>

<p id="auto_735ae423-88b2-4bdc-89e6-12ecd357630b_fs-idm362389248">Upon initial review, it appears that the snow boot product line is unprofitable. Should this product line be eliminated? To adequately analyze this situation, a proper analysis of the relevant revenues and costs must be made. The functional income statement in <a href="#auto_735ae423-88b2-4bdc-89e6-12ecd357630b_OSX_Acct_M10_04_Snow01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> does not separate relevant from non-relevant costs.</p>
<p id="auto_735ae423-88b2-4bdc-89e6-12ecd357630b_fs-idm385893440">In conducting the analysis, the accounting team discovers that each product line is allocated certain costs over which the product line managers have no control. These <span data-type="term">allocated costs</span> are typically associated with areas of the company that do not generate revenue but are necessary for the running of the organization, such as salaries for executives, human resources, and accounting at headquarters.</p>
<p id="auto_735ae423-88b2-4bdc-89e6-12ecd357630b_fs-idm356244288">The cost of these parts of the organization must somehow be shared with the revenue-generating portions of the business. Companies often allocate these costs to other parts of the organization based on some formula, such as dividing the total costs by the number of divisions or segments, as percentage of total revenue, or as percentage of total square footage.</p>
<p id="auto_735ae423-88b2-4bdc-89e6-12ecd357630b_fs-idm357217200">SnowBucks currently allocates these costs equally to the three product lines, and all the fixed selling and administrative expenses are considered allocated costs. In addition, the fixed manufacturing expenses represent factory rent, depreciation, and insurance, and all these costs will continue to exist regardless of whether the snow boot division continues. However, included in the fixed manufacturing expenses is the $75,000 salary of a sales supervisor for each division. This is an avoidable fixed cost as this cost would no longer exist if any division ceased operating.</p>

The reason the snow boot product line was showing an operating loss was due to the allocation of common costs. Consideration should be given to the way allocated costs are assigned to the various products to determine if the allocation is logical or if another allocation method, such as one based on each product line’s percentage of the total corporate sales, would provide a better matching of costs and services provided by corporate headquarters. Management should also consider qualitative factors, such as the impact of removing one product line on the overall sales of the other products. If customers commonly buy snow boots and skis together, then discontinuing the snow boot line could impact the sales of snow skis.</p>

Currently, the company has 4,600 partially completed X Plus models on hand. The government has put a recall on a particular part in the X Plus model, so each base model must now be reworked to accommodate the style of the new part. The company has spent $110 per unit to manufacture these X Plus models to their current state. Reworking each X Plus model will cost $20 for materials and $20 for direct labor. In addition, $7 of variable overhead and $32 of allocated fixed overhead (relating primarily to depreciation of plant and equipment) will be allocated per unit. If Trifecta completes the X Plus models, it can sell them for $160 per unit. On the other hand, another manufacturer is interested in purchasing the partially completed units for $104 each and converting them into Z Plus models. Prepare a differential analysis per unit to determine if Trifecta should complete the X Plus models or sell them in their current state.</p>

The company has spent $110 per unit to manufacture these Z Best models to their current state. Reworking each Z Best model will cost $22 for materials and $25 for direct labor. In addition, $9 of variable overhead and $34 of allocated fixed overhead (relating primarily to depreciation of plant and equipment) will be allocated per unit. If ZZOOM completes the Z Best models, it can sell them for $180 per unit. On the other hand, another manufacturer is interested in purchasing the partially completed units for $105 each and converting them into Z Plus models. Prepare a differential analysis per unit to determine if ZZOOM should complete the Z Best models or sell them in their current state.</p>

<p id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm245444992">One major decision a company has to make is to determine the point at which to sell their product—in other words, when it is no longer cost effective to continue processing the product before sale. For example, in refining oil, the refined oil can be sold at various stages of the refining process. The point at which some products are removed from production and sold while others receive additional processing is known as the <span data-type="term">split-off point</span>. As you have learned, the relevant revenues and costs must be evaluated in order to make the best decision for the company.</p>

<p id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm242249040">In making the decision, a company must consider the <span data-type="term">joint costs</span>, or those costs that have been shared by products up to the split-off point. In some manufacturing processes, several end products are produced from a single raw material input. For example, once milk has been processed it can be sold as milk or it can be processed further into cheese, yogurt, cream, or ice cream. The costs of processing the milk to the stage at which it can be sold or processed further are the joint costs. These costs are allocated among all the products that are sold at the split off point as well as those products that are processed further. Ice cream has the basic costs of the milk plus the costs of processing it further into ice cream.</p>

<p id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm212628352">As another example, suppose a company that makes leather jackets realizes it has a reasonable amount of unused leather from the cutting of the patterns for the jackets. Typically, this scrap leather is sold, but the company is beginning to consider using the scrap to make leather belts. How would the company allocate the costs incurred from processing and preparing the leather before cutting it if they decide to make both the jackets and the belts? Would it be financially beneficial to process the scrap leather further into belts?</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm237785632"><h3 data-type="title">Fundamentals of the Decision to Sell or Process Further</h3>
<p id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm245458192">When facing the choice of selling or processing further, the company must determine the revenues that would be received if the product is sold at the split-off point versus the net revenues that would be received if the product is processed further. This requires knowing the additional costs of further processing. In general, if the differential revenue from further processing is greater than the differential costs, then it will be profitable to process a joint product after the split-off point. Any costs incurred prior to the split-off point are irrelevant to the decision to process further as those are sunk costs; only future costs are relevant costs.</p>
<p id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm238582480">Even though joint product costs are common costs, they are routinely allocated to the joint products. A potential reason for this treatment is the GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) requirement that all production costs must be inventoried.</p>
<p id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm237308160">Be aware that some complexities can arise when allocating joint product costs. The first issue is that joint production costs can be allocated based on varying production and sales characteristics or assumptions. For example, a physical measurement method, a relative sales value method at the point of split-off, and a net realizable value method based on additional processing after the split-off point can all be used to allocate joint production costs.</p>
<p id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm238223264">A second complexity is that eliminating the production of one or more joint products will not always enable the company to reduce joint production costs. Because of the mechanics of the common cost allocation process, such an action will only work if reductions are made in all of the joint products collectively. If only some of the joint products are eliminated, the remaining joint product or products would absorb all of the joint product costs.</p>
<p id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm232934080">An example of this last issue might help clarify the point. Assume that you have a lumber production company that cuts trees, prepares board lumber for housing and furniture, and also prepares sawdust and wood scraps that is used in the production of particle board. Assume that in a given year the company experienced $1,100,000 in joint costs. Using one of the three previously mentioned cost allocation methods, the company allocated $1,000,000 in joint costs to the production of board lumber and $100,000 to the production of wood scraps and sawdust.</p>
<p id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm238594272">Assume that in the next year it also experienced $1,100,000 in joint costs. However, in that year, the company lost its buyer of wood scraps and sawdust, so it had to give both of them away, without generating any revenue. In this case, the company would still realize $1,100,000 in joint costs. However, the entire amount would be allocated to the production of the board lumber. The only way to reduce the joint costs is to realize joint costs of less than $1,000,000.</p>

<p id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm240892544">Luxury Leathers, Inc., produces various leather accessories, such as belts and wallets. In the process of cutting out the leather pieces for each product, 400,000 pounds of scrap leather is produced. Luxury has been selling this leather scrap to Sammy’s Scrap Procurement for $2.25 per pound. Luxury has an employee suggestion box and one of the suggestions was to use most of the scrap to make leather watch bands. The management of Luxury is interested in this idea as the machines necessary to produce the watch bands are the same as the ones used in making belts and would merely need reprogramming for the cutting and stitching processes on the watch bands. The process to attach the buckle would be the same for the watch bands as it was for the belts, thus this would require no additional worker training. Luxury would have additional costs for new packaging and for the supply and insertion of the pins that connect the band to the watch. The total variable cost to produce the watch band would be $2.85. Fixed costs would increase by $85,000 per year for the lease of the packaging equipment, and Luxury estimates it could produce and sell 100,000 watch bands per year. Finished watch bands could be sold for $15.00 each. Should Luxury continue to sell the scrap leather or should Luxury process the scrap into watch bands to sell?</p>

<p id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm237315440">Ainsley’s Apples grows organic apples and sells them to national grocery chains, local grocers, and markets. Ainsley purchased a machine for $450,000 that sorts the apples by size. The largest apples are sold as loose apples to the various stores, the medium sized apples are bagged and sold to the grocers in their bagged state, and the smallest apples are sold to deep discounters or to a local manufacturing plant that processes the apples into applesauce. Ainsley is considering keeping the small apples and processing them into apple juice that would be sold under Ainsley’s own label to local grocers. The small apples currently sell to the deep discounters and local manufacturers for $1.10 per dozen. The variable cost to prepare the small apples for sale, including transporting the apples, is $0.30 per dozen. Ainsley can sell each gallon of organic apple juice for $3.50 per gallon. It takes two dozen small apples to make one gallon of apple juice. The cost to produce the organic apple juice will be $0.60 variable cost per gallon plus $200,000 fixed costs for the one-year lease of the equipment needed to make and bottle the juice. Ainsley normally harvests and sells 2,400,000 small apples per year. Should Ainsley continue to sell the small apples to local grocers and the applesauce manufacturer or should Ainsley process the apples further into organic apple juice?</p>

Some units in the work-in-process inventory have costs of $30 per unit associated with them, but Mallory can only sell these units in their current state for $22 each. Otherwise, it will cost Mallory $11 per unit to rework these units so that they can be sold for $38 each. How much is the financial impact if the units are processed further?</p>

<p id="auto_7cddbaee-893e-4dda-98e1-cd643e83542b_fs-idm246756128">In general, if the differential revenue from processing further is greater than the differential costs, then it will be profitable to process a joint product after the split-off point. Any costs incurred prior to the split-off point are irrelevant to the decision to process further, as those are sunk costs, and only future costs are relevant costs. Joint product costs are common costs that are incurred simultaneously to produce a variety of end products. Even though they are common costs, they are routinely allocated to the joint products.</p>

In the process of cutting out the cloth pieces for each product, a certain amount of scrap cloth is produced. Quality has been selling this cloth scrap to Jorge’s Scrap Warehouse for $3.25 per pound. Last year, the company sold 40,000 lb. of scrap, which would be enough to make 10,000 teddy bears that the management of Quality is now interested in producing. Their processes would need some reprogramming, particularly in the cutting and stitching processes, but it would require no additional worker training. However, new packaging would be needed. The total variable cost to produce the teddy bears $3.85. Fixed costs would increase by $95,000 per year for the lease of the packaging equipment and Quality estimates it could produce and sell 10,000 teddy bears per year. Finished teddy bears could be sold for $18.00 each. Should Quality continue to sell the scrap cloth or should Quality process the scrap into teddy bears to sell?</p>

<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm201314560">Companies use various resources to be productive. These resources, which include time, labor, space, and machines, are limited, thus constraining the ability of a company to have unlimited productive capacity. For example, a retail store is constrained by the amount of floor space available to display its goods, while a law office may be constrained by the number of hours the paralegal team can feasibly work. These constraints require companies to make decisions on the best ways to allocate their resources in a way that maximizes the benefit to the firm. This situation is especially true when a company is operating at capacity or makes multiple products or provides multiple services.</p>

<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm179443584">The question as to which products and how many should be made is a common constraint problem. For example, consider a business that runs at capacity, making four products by running two eight-hour shifts per day, seven days a week for 50 weeks per year. This business is limited to 5,600 working hours per year (8 hr. shifts × 2 shifts × 7 days per week × 50 weeks) unless a third shift is added. Adding a third shift may be prohibitive for any number of reasons, including local ordinances that prevent operating twenty-four hours a day, Environmental Protection Agency constraints, or the down-time of the machines that is required several hours a day for maintenance and calibration. What is the best way for this company to use these work hours? Which products should it produce first and how many of each should it produce?</p>

<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm215231424">These types of situations constrain, or limit, management’s ability to use their facilities and workforce. Having limited availability of a resource, such as time, labor, or machine hours means that item becomes a scarce resource. A <span data-type="term">constraint</span> is a scarce resource that limits the output or productive capacity of the organization.</p>

<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm177399024">Ordinarily, there are very few actual constraints in any process. Sometimes, there is only one. However, the existence of a constraint can have a major effect on the productivity of an organization. This fact applies to all types of entities, such as production facilities or service providers. One way to view this issue is to consider the old cliché that <em data-effect="italics">a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</em> In the example, when trying to measure or estimate an organization’s maximum efficiency, its results will often be reduced by the overall negative effects of the constraints. When the constraint slows production, it is called a <span data-type="term">bottleneck</span>. Managers are often faced with the problem of deciding how to best use a scarce resource to prevent bottlenecks. Under the constraint of limited resources, how do managers make decisions when they are working within these conditions?</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm196170640"><h3 data-type="title">Fundamentals of How to Make Decisions When Resources are Constrained</h3>
<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm177448416">As with other short-term decisions, a company must consider the relevant costs and revenues when making decisions when resources are constrained. Whether the organization facing a constraint is a merchandising, manufacturing, or service organization, the initial step in allocating scarce or constrained resources is to determine the <span data-type="term">unit contribution margin</span>, which is the selling price per unit minus the variable cost per unit, for each product or service. The company should produce or provide the products or services that generate the highest contribution margin first, followed by those with the second highest, and so forth. The total contribution margin will be maximized by promoting those products or accepting those orders with the highest contribution margin in relation to the scarce resource. In other words, products or services should be ranked based on their <span data-type="term">unit contribution margin per production restraint</span>, which is the unit contribution margin divided by the production restraint.</p>
<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm194593360">If constraints are not managed, a bottleneck usually results, meaning that production slows and a back-up occurs at stages prior to the bottleneck. For example, in producing boxes of cereal, if the cereal is produced at a rate of 1,000 ounces per minute but the bagging machines can only bag 800 ounces per minute, this will create a bottleneck. Similarly, if on a Saturday morning before a home football game, the local grocery store has ten checkout lines but only opens four of them, long lines will result from the constraint of too few checkout lanes available. Management must decide how many scarce resources (employees, in this example) to pull from stocking the shelves to running cash registers. It may be difficult to see how bottlenecks affect profitability, and they appear to be more of a timing or throughput issue. But bottlenecks can affect profitability in a number of ways. Bottlenecks at the grocery story can result in customers leaving to store shop elsewhere or can negatively affect the reputation of the store, which can impact future sales. In the cereal example, bottlenecks in the packaging area can slow the delivery of boxes of cereal to distributors and individual stores. Poor or inconsistent delivery may drive customers to purchase from other cereal manufacturers, which would have a definite impact on profitability.</p>
<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm205394928">A common problem relating to constraints occurs in multi-product production environments. Management will need to evaluate the constraints to determine the best mix of products that will minimize the effects of the constraints. In addition to making sure that the best product mix is chosen, managers should seek ways to increase the effective capacity of the constraint. Conceptually, there are two ways a company can do this: increase the rate of output at the bottleneck, or increase the time available at the bottleneck. Increasing the capacity of the constraint or bottleneck is also called <em data-effect="italics">relaxing the constraint</em> or <em data-effect="italics">elevating the constraint</em>. Some specific examples of ways to relax the constraint include:</p>
<ul id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm177882096">
<li>Keep the production facilities open longer hours. This may allow the work-flow through the bottleneck area to be slowed and thus prevent the bottleneck from occurring. However, this may require paying workers overtime pay.</li>
<li>If working extra hours is not a viable option, then moving additional workers to the bottleneck area may be beneficial as long as the areas from which they were moved are adequately covered and additional problem areas do not result.</li>
<li>Instead of using current workers, additional staff may be hired to smooth the work flow through the bottleneck area.</li>
<li>Outsource some or all of the work in the area of the bottleneck. It may be cheaper and more cost effective to buy parts of components than to slow production due to the bottleneck.</li>
<li>Redesign the production process to prevent the bottleneck by adding more resources to eliminate the bottleneck, reorganizing the process to distribute the bottleneck-causing activities to different parts of the production process, or managing processing times at other stages prior to the bottleneck to help prevent the bottleneck form occurring.</li>
<li>Insuring a minimal number of defects and rework, since they typically slow the production process and thus add to the bottleneck.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm177386336">Preventing and minimizing bottlenecks can have significant benefits to the bottom line of the company. The reduction of bottlenecks allows the company to move more products through the production phase and thus be ready to sell.</p>

<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm218528368">The case of the fiery <strong class="colored-text">Ford</strong> Pinto demonstrates that more than cost and revenue should be considered when making an ethical business decision. In the early 1970s, the <strong class="colored-text">Ford Motor Company</strong> set out to build a Pinto for less than $2,000. Cars were much less expensive then, and Ford had to determine whether or not to include a component part that cost around $10. Given the high cost, Ford decided not to include the component, a rubber bladder for the gas tank. However, in rear-end collisions at over 21 miles per hour, the rubber bladder component functions to prevent the gas tank from flooding the interior of the car with gasoline and gas fumes. Because of the decision not to include the component, a number of Pintos involved in collisions exploded into flames, injuring and sometimes killing the occupants.</p>
<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm216332448">Although <strong class="colored-text">Ford</strong> was aware of the defect, the company’s cost/benefit analysis indicated it was less expensive to build Pintos without the rubber bladder, even when including expected reimbursement costs for anyone injured or killed. However, the decision to allow a defective product to be built in order to reduce overall costs caused a significant hit to <strong class="colored-text">Ford</strong>’s reputation. Ultimately, the litigation costs for knowingly constructing a defective car were higher than the original cost of including the rubber bladder component. While <strong class="colored-text">Ford</strong>’s decision seemed profitable in the short-term, their financial analysis could have been improved if it also took into account long-term impacts.</p>

<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm205783376">Wood World should fulfill the orders for bookcases first, desks second, and chairs last. The bookcases provide the highest contribution margin per machine-hour, followed by desks and then chairs. Maximizing the contribution margin per constraint, in this case per machine-hour, is the best way for Wood World to manage the constraint. How many of each item will be produced?</p>
<span data-type="media" id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm205289648" data-alt="Available machine hours 80,000 plus Hours to fill bookcase orders (40,000 times 0.25) 10,000 equals Remaining hours 70,000. Remaining hours plus Hours to fill desk orders (60,000 times 1) 60,000 equals Remaining hours 10,000.

</span>
<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm201436832">Therefore, based on contribution margin and the constraint of machine hours, Wood World should fill all 40,000 of the bookcase orders first, then fill the 60,000 desk orders and, and fill 20,000 of the chair orders last.</p>
<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm197917088">Are there any qualitative issues that Wood World should consider? One concern may be that customers who typically buy a desk and chair together may not be able to do so if the chair production is affected by a bottleneck. Another qualitative issue in keeping with the furniture example is that a company might find producing dining room tables to be significantly more profitable than matching chairs or matching cupboards. However, they will still be required to produce the less profitable chairs and cupboards, because many consumers will want to buy all three items as a set.</p>
<p id="auto_8deba5ed-57c1-4097-92b6-6dab8b2cdf44_fs-idm178972416">The benefits of effectively managing constraints can be enormous. Managers need to understand the positive impact effective management of constrained resources can have on the company’s bottom line. The contribution margin per unit of the scarce resource can be used to assess the value of relaxing the constraint. When there is unsatisfied demand for a single product because of a constraint, the value of additional time on the constraint is simply the contribution margin per unit of the scarce resource for that product. When there are two or more products with unsatisfied demand, the value of additional time on the bottleneck would be the largest contribution margin per unit of the scarce resource for any product whose demand is unsatisfied. In many situations, when dealing with conflicting time constraints an evaluation of multiple bottlenecks might identify a viable solution. While many bottleneck issues and their solutions could be somewhat complex, others might be addressed more simply. For example, in some cases the problem might be solved by the addition of an additional work shift.</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm206689632">Financial statement analysis reviews financial information found on financial statements to make informed decisions about the business. The income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows, among other financial information, can be analyzed. The information obtained from this analysis can benefit decision-making for internal and external stakeholders and can give a company valuable information on overall performance and specific areas for improvement. The analysis can help them with budgeting, deciding where to cut costs, how to increase revenues, and future capital investments opportunities.</p>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm242822752">When considering the outcomes from analysis, it is important for a company to understand that data produced needs to be compared to others within industry and close competitors. The company should also consider their past experience and how it corresponds to current and future performance expectations. Three common analysis tools are used for decision-making; horizontal analysis, vertical analysis, and financial ratios.</p>

Let’s begin our analysis discussion by looking at horizontal analysis.</p>
</section>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm208284992">Horizontal analysis (also known as trend analysis) looks at trends over time on various financial statement line items. A company will look at one period (usually a year) and compare it to another period. For example, a company may compare sales from their current year to sales from the prior year. The trending of items on these financial statements can give a company valuable information on overall performance and specific areas for improvement. It is most valuable to do horizontal analysis for information over multiple periods to see how change is occurring for each line item. If multiple periods are not used, it can be difficult to identify a trend. The year being used for comparison purposes is called the base year (usually the prior period). The year of comparison for horizontal analysis is analyzed for dollar and percent changes against the base year.</p>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm233652048">The dollar change is found by taking the dollar amount in the base year and subtracting that from the year of analysis.</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm234100768">Using Banyan Goods as our example, if Banyan wanted to compare net sales in the current year (year of analysis) of $120,000 to the prior year (base year) of $100,000, the dollar change would be as follows:</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm252359952">This means Banyan Goods saw an increase of $20,000 in net sales in the current year as compared to the prior year, which was a 20% increase. The same dollar change and percentage change calculations would be used for the income statement line items as well as the balance sheet line items.

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm210121008">Depending on their expectations, Banyan Goods could make decisions to alter operations to produce expected outcomes. For example, Banyan saw a 50% accounts receivable increase from the prior year to the current year. If they were only expecting a 20% increase, they may need to explore this line item further to determine what caused this difference and how to correct it going forward. It could possibly be that they are extending credit more readily than anticipated or not collecting as rapidly on outstanding accounts receivable. The company will need to further examine this difference before deciding on a course of action. Another method of analysis Banyan might consider before making a decision is vertical analysis.</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm208291552">Vertical analysis shows a comparison of a line item within a statement to another line item within that same statement. For example, a company may compare cash to total assets in the current year. This allows a company to see what percentage of cash (the comparison line item) makes up total assets (the other line item) during the period. This is different from horizontal analysis, which compares across years. Vertical analysis compares line items within a statement in the current year. This can help a business to know how much of one item is contributing to overall operations. For example, a company may want to know how much inventory contributes to total assets. They can then use this information to make business decisions such as preparing the budget, cutting costs, increasing revenues, or capital investments.</p>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm217791792">The company will need to determine which line item they are comparing all items to within that statement and then calculate the percentage makeup. These percentages are considered <em data-effect="italics">common-size</em> because they make businesses within industry comparable by taking out fluctuations for size. It is typical for an income statement to use net sales (or sales) as the comparison line item. This means net sales will be set at 100% and all other line items within the income statement will represent a percentage of net sales.</p>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm200829344">On the balance sheet, a company will typically look at two areas: (1) total assets, and (2) total liabilities and stockholders’ equity. Total assets will be set at 100% and all assets will represent a percentage of total assets. Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity will also be set at 100% and all line items within liabilities and equity will be represented as a percentage of total liabilities and stockholders’ equity. The line item set at 100% is considered the base amount and the comparison line item is considered the comparison amount. The formula to determine the common-size percentage is:</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm217861248">For example, if Banyan Goods set total assets as the base amount and wanted to see what percentage of total assets were made up of cash in the current year, the following calculation would occur.</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm212658720">Cash in the current year is $110,000 and total assets equal $250,000, giving a common-size percentage of 44%. If the company had an expected cash balance of 40% of total assets, they would be exceeding expectations. This may not be enough of a difference to make a change, but if they notice this deviates from industry standards, they may need to make adjustments, such as reducing the amount of cash on hand to reinvest in the business. The image below shows the common-size calculations on the comparative income statements and comparative balance sheets for Banyan Goods.</p><figure id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_OSX_Acct_00_AA_FS03"><figcaption>Income Statements and Vertical Analysis.</figcaption>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm241556128">Even though vertical analysis is a statement comparison within the same year, Banyan can use information from the prior year’s vertical analysis to make sure the business is operating as expected. For example, unearned revenues increased from the prior year to the current year and made up a larger portion of total liabilities and stockholders’ equity. This could be due to many factors, and Banyan Goods will need to examine this further to see why this change has occurred. Let’s turn to financial statement analysis using financial ratios.</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm200734672">Financial ratios help both internal and external users of information make informed decisions about a company. A stakeholder could be looking to invest, become a supplier, make a loan, or alter internal operations, among other things, based in part on the outcomes of ratio analysis. The information resulting from ratio analysis can be used to examine trends in performance, establish benchmarks for success, set budget expectations, and compare industry competitors. There are four main categories of ratios: liquidity, solvency, efficiency, and profitability. Note that while there are more ideal outcomes for some ratios, the industry in which the business operates can change the influence each of these outcomes has over stakeholder decisions. (You will learn more about ratios, industry standards, and ratio interpretation in advanced accounting courses.)</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm212669632"><h4 data-type="title">Liquidity Ratios</h4>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm236112800">Liquidity ratios show the ability of the company to pay short-term obligations if they came due immediately with assets that can be quickly converted to cash. This is done by comparing current assets to current liabilities. Lenders, for example, may consider the outcomes of liquidity ratios when deciding whether to extend a loan to a company. A company would like to be liquid enough to manage any currently due obligations but not too liquid where they may not be effectively investing in growth opportunities. Three common liquidity measurements are working capital, current ratio, and quick ratio.</p>
<section data-depth="3" id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm235943968"><h5 data-type="title">Working Capital</h5>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm249902640">Working capital measures the financial health of an organization in the short-term by finding the difference between current assets and current liabilities. A company will need enough current assets to cover current liabilities; otherwise, they may not be able to continue operations in the future. Before a lender extends credit, they will review the working capital of the company to see if the company can meet their obligations.

A company can take out loans, issue stock, and retain earnings to be used in future periods to keep operations running. It is less risky and less costly to use equity sources for financing as compared to debt resources. This is mainly due to interest expense repayment that a loan carries as opposed to equity, which does not have this requirement. Therefore, a company wants to know how much debt and equity contribute to its financing. Ideally, a company would prefer more equity than debt financing. The formula for the debt to equity ratio is:</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm245543360">There are several advantages and disadvantages to financial statement analysis. Financial statement analysis can show trends over time, which can be helpful in making future business decisions. Converting information to percentages or ratios eliminates some of the disparity between competitor sizes and operating abilities, making it easier for stakeholders to make informed decisions. It can assist with understanding the makeup of current operations within the business, and which shifts need to occur internally to increase productivity.</p>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm212405888">A stakeholder needs to keep in mind that past performance does not always dictate future performance.
