<p id="auto_7de3b56d-445f-4792-810c-ed53a481786e_fs-idm411595216">You have been elected as the coordinator of committees for your school’s business honor society. In essence, this makes you the manager of all the committees. This is a new position that was created because the committees have never been evaluated for their effectiveness within the organization. Your job in this position is to ensure that the committees—such as recruiting, fundraising, community service, professional activities, and regional and national conference presentations—are operating within the goals put forth in the society’s mission statements, as well as to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of each committee in meeting the organization’s goals. Your starting point is to understand the overriding mission—the strategic direction and purpose—of the society. Next, you want to understand how each committee fits into the strategic goal of the society and then identify the separate goals of each committee. Once you understand the purpose and goal of each committee, it will be necessary to know how each committee is going about meeting its goals. Last, you will evaluate each committee to see if the goals are being met.</p>

<p id="auto_7de3b56d-445f-4792-810c-ed53a481786e_fs-idm388835584">Notice that in performing your role as the coordinator of committees, you will need financial information, such as budgets and financial statements, along with other nonfinancial information, for example, the society’s mission statement, each committee’s strategy statement, and records of their activities and meetings. To help assess how well the honor society and its committees are meeting their goals, you need more information than can be obtained from simply looking at the various financial documents assembled by each committee within the organization. The same is true in any business organization. Managers and other internal decision makers need more information than is available in the basic financial statements: they need information generated by the managerial accounting system.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm357818384">Financial accounting process provides a useful level of detail for external users, such as investors and creditors, but it does not provide enough detailed information for the types of decisions made in the day-to-day operation of the business or for the types of decisions that guide the company long term. <span data-type="term">Managerial accounting</span> is the process that allows decision makers to set and evaluate business goals by determining what information they need to make a particular decision and how to analyze and communicate this information. Let’s explore the role of managerial accounting in several different organizations and at different levels of the organization, and then examine the primary responsibilities of management.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm365246096">Three friends who are recent graduates from business school, Alex, Hana, and Gillian, have each just begun their first postgraduation jobs. They meet for lunch and discuss what each of their jobs entails. Alex has taken a position as a market analyst for a Fortune 500 company that operates in the shipping industry. Her first assignment is to suggest and evaluate ways the company can increase the revenue from shipping contracts by 10 percent for the year. Before tackling this project, she has a number of questions. What is the purpose of this analysis? What type of information does she need? Where would she find this information? Can she get it from a basic income statement and balance sheet? How will she know if her suggestions for pricing are creating more shipping contracts and helping to meet the company’s goal? She begins with an analysis of the company’s top fifty customers, including the prices they pay, discounts offered, discounts applied, frequency of shipments, and so on, to determine if there are price adjustments that need to be made to attract those customers to use the company’s shipping services more frequently.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm370293584">Hana has a position in the human resources department of a pharmaceutical company and is asked to research and analyze a new trend in compensation in which employers are forgoing raises to employees and are instead giving large bonuses for meeting certain goals. Her task is to ascertain if this new idea would be appropriate for her company. Her questions are similar to Alex’s. What information does she need? Where would she find this information? How would she determine the impact of this type of change on the business? If implemented, what information would she need to assess the success of the plan?</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm374536176">Gillian is working in the supply chain area of a major manufacturer that produces the various mirrors found on cars and trucks. Her first assignment is to determine whether it is more cost effective and efficient for her company to make or purchase a bracket used in the assembly of the mirrors. Her questions are also similar to her friends’ questions. Why is the company considering this decision? What information does she need? Where would she find this information? Would choosing the option with the lowest cost be the correct choice?</p>

Although none of these individuals is given the title of manager, they need information to help provide management with the information necessary to make decisions to move the company forward with its strategic plan. The scenarios of the three women are not unique. These types of questions occur every day in businesses across the world.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm364149792">Some decisions will be more clearly appropriate for higher-level management. For example, Lynx Boating Company produces three different lines of boats (sport boats, pontoon boats, and large cruisers). All three boat lines are profitable, but the pontoon boat line seems to be less profitable than the other two types of boats. Management may want to consider abandoning the pontoon line and using that additional capacity to produce one of the other more profitable lines. They would need detailed financial information in order to make such a decision.</p>

</div>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm370444000">Service organizations also face decisions that require more detailed information than is available in financial accounting statements. A company’s financial statements aggregate information for the company as a whole, but for most managerial decisions, information must be gathered in a timely manner at a product, customer, or division level. For example, the management of City Hospital is considering the purchase of four new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines that scan three times faster than their current machines and thus would allow the hospital’s imaging department to evaluate eight additional patients each day. Each machine costs $425,000 and will last five years before needing to be replaced. Would this be a wise investment for City Hospital? Hospital management would need the appropriate information to assess the alternatives in order to make this decision. Throughout your study of managerial accounting, you will learn about the types of information needed to make these decisions, as well as techniques for analyzing this information. First, it is important to understand the various roles managers play in the organization in order to understand the types of information and the level of detail that are needed. Most of the job responsibilities of a manager fit into one of three categories: planning, controlling, or evaluating.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm370525024">The model in <a href="#auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_OSX_Acct_M01_01_MissionSt" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> sums up the three primary responsibilities of management and the managerial accountant’s role in the process. As you can see from the model, the function of accomplishing an entity’s mission statement is a circular, ongoing process.</p>

This statement should be broad enough that it will encompass future growth and changes of the company. <a href="#auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm376388736" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> contains the mission statement of three different types of companies: a manufacturer, an e-commerce company, and a service company.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm381174832">Once the mission of the company has been determined, the company can begin the process of setting <span data-type="term">goals</span>, or what the company expects to accomplish over time, and <span data-type="term">objectives</span>, or the targets that need to be met in order to meet the company’s goals. This is known as <span data-type="term">planning</span>. Planning occurs at all levels of an organization and can cover various periods of time. One type of planning, called <span data-type="term">strategic planning</span>, involves setting priorities and determining how to allocate corporate resources to help an organization accomplish both short-term and long-term goals. For example, one hotel may want to be the low-price, no-frills, clean alternative, while another may decide to be the superior quality, high-price luxury hotel with many amenities. Obviously, to be successful, either of these businesses must determine the goals necessary to meet their particular strategy.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm373659472">Typically, a strategic plan will span any number of years an organization chooses (three, five, seven, or even ten years), and often companies will have multiple strategic plans, such as one for three years, one for five years, and one for ten years. Given the time length involved in many plans, the organization also needs to factor in the potential effects of changes in their senior executive leadership and the composition of the board of directors.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm374430704">What types of objectives are part of a strategic plan? Strategic objectives should be diverse and will vary from company to company and from industry to industry, but some general goals can include maximizing market share, increasing short-term profits, increasing innovation, offering the best value for the cost, maintaining commitment to community programs, and exceeding environmental protection mandates.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm362770192">From a managerial accounting perspective, planning involves determining steps or actions to meet the strategic or other goals of the company. For example, Daryn’s Dairy, a major producer of organic dairy products in the Midwest, has made increasing the market share of its products one of its strategic goals. However, to be truly effective, the goals need to be defined specifically. For example, the goals might be stated in terms of percentage growth, both annually and in terms of the number of markets addressed in their growth projections.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm370373568">Also, Daryn’s planning process would include the steps the company plans to use to implement to increase market share. These plans may include current-year plans, five-year plans, and ten-year plans.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm366469504">The current-year plan may be to sell the company’s products in 10 percent more stores in the states in which it currently operates. The five-year plan may be to sell the products internationally in three countries, and the ten-year plan may be to acquire their chief competitor and, thus, their customers. Each of these plans will require outlining specific steps to reach these goals and communicating those steps to the employees who will carry out or have an impact on reaching these goals and implementing these plans.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm373323472">Planning can involve financial and nonfinancial processes and measures. One planning tool discussed in <a href="#page_de2d2ed2-6dd3-4b33-bce4-95cd02be4d0f">Budgeting</a> is the budgeting process, which requires management to assess the resources—for example, time, money, and number and type of employees needed—to meet current-year objectives. Budgeting often includes both financial data, such as worker pay rates, and nonfinancial data, such as the number of customers an employee can serve in a given time period.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm373038656">A retail company can plan for the expected sales volume, a hospital can plan for the number of x-rays they expect to administer, a law firm can plan the hours expected for the various types of legal services they perform, a manufacturing firm can plan for the level of quality expected in each item produced, and a utility company can plan for the level of air pollutants that are acceptable. Notice that in each of these examples, the aspect of the business that is being planned and evaluated is a qualitative (nonfinancial) factor or characteristic. In your study of managerial accounting, you will learn about many situations in which both financial and nonfinancial data or information are equally relevant. However, the qualitative aspects are typically not quantified in dollars but evaluated using some other standards, such as customers served or students advised.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm326572624">While these functions are initially stated in qualitative terms, most of these items would at some point be translated into a dollar value or dollar effect. In each of these examples, the managerial accounting function would help to determine the variables that would help appropriately measure the desired goal as well as plan how to quantify these measures. However, measures are only useful if tracked and used to determine their effectiveness. This is known as the control function of management.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm365532784"><h3 data-type="title">Controlling</h3>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm365532144">To measure whether plans are meeting objectives or goals, management must put in place ways to assess success or lack of success. <span data-type="term">Controlling</span> involves the monitoring of the planning objectives that were put into place. For example, if you have a retail store and you have a plan to minimize shoplifting, you can implement a control, such as antitheft tags that trigger an alarm when someone removes them from the store. You could also install in the ceilings cameras that provide a different view of customers shopping and therefore may catch a thief more easily or clearly. The antitheft tags and cameras serve as your controls against shoplifting.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm365530704">Managerial accounting is a useful tool in the management control function. Managerial accounting helps determine the appropriate controls for measuring the success of a plan. There are many types of controls that a company can use. Some controls can be in the form of financial measures, such as the ratio for inventory turnover, which is a measure of inventory control and is defined as Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory, or in the form of a performance measure, such as decreasing production costs by 10 percent to help guide or control the decisions made by managers. Other controls can be physical controls, such as fingerprint identification or password protection. Essentially, the controlling function in management involves helping to coordinate the day-to-day activities of a business so that these activities lead to meeting corporate goals.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm358005952">Without controls, it is very unlikely a plan would be successful, and it would be difficult to know if your plan was a success. Consider the plan by Daryn’s Dairy to increase market share. The plan for the first year was to increase market share by selling the company’s products in 10 percent more stores in the states in which the company already operates. How will the company implement this plan? The implementation, or carrying out, of the plan will require the company to put controls in place to measure which new stores are successfully selling the company’s products, which products are being sold the most, what the sales volume and dollar value of the new stores are, and whether the sales in these new stores are affecting the volume of sales in current stores. Without this information, the company would not know if the plan is reaching the desired result of increased market share.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm375539520">The control function helps to determine the courses of action that are taken in the implementation of a plan by helping to define and administer the steps of the plan. Essentially, the control function facilitates coordination of the plan within the organization. It is through the system of controls that the actual results of decisions made in implementing a plan can be identified and measured. Managerial accounting not only helps to determine and design control measures, it also assists by providing performance reports and control reports that focus on variances between the planned objective performance and the actual performance. Control is achieved through effective feedback, or information that is used to assess a process. Feedback allows management to evaluate the results, determine whether progress is being made, or determine whether corrective measures need to be taken. This evaluation is in the next management function.</p>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm350546800">Managers must ultimately determine whether the company has met the goals set in the planning phase. <span data-type="term">Evaluating</span>, also called <em data-effect="italics">assessing</em> or <em data-effect="italics">analyzing</em>, involves comparing actual results against expected results, and it can occur at the product, department, division, and company levels. When there are deviations from the stated objectives, managers must decide what modifications are needed.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm360535504">The controls that were put into place to coordinate the implementation of a particular company plan must be evaluated so that success can be measured, or corrective action can be taken. Consider Daryn’s Dairy’s one-year plan to increase market share by selling products in 10 percent more stores in the states in which the company currently operates. Suppose one of the controls put into place is to measure the sales in the current stores to determine if selling the company’s products in new stores is adding new sales or merely moving sales from existing stores. This control measure, same-store sales, must be evaluated to determine the effect of the decision to expand the selling of products within the state. This control measure will be evaluated by comparing sales in the current year in those stores to sales from the prior year in those same stores. The results of this evaluation will help guide management in their decision to move forward with their plan, to modify the plan, or to scrap the plan.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm356941312">As discussed previously, not all evaluations will involve quantitative or financial measures. In expanding market share, the company wants to maintain or improve its reputation with customers and does not want the planned increased availability or easier access to their products to decrease customer perceptions of the products or the company. They could use customer surveys to evaluate the perceived effect on the company’s reputation as a result of implementing this one-year plan. However, there are many ways that companies can evaluate various controls. In addition to the financial gauges, organizations are now measuring efficiencies, customer development, employee retention, and sustainability.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm360317968">Managers spend their time in various stages of planning, controlling, and evaluating. Generally, higher-level managers spend more time on planning, whereas lower-level managers spend more time on evaluating. At any level, managers work closely with the managerial accounting team to help in each of these stages. Managerial accountants help determine whether plans are measurable, what controls should be implemented to carry out a plan, and what are the proper means of evaluation of those controls. This would include the type of feedback necessary for management to assess the results of their plans and actions. Management accountants generate the reports and information needed to assess the results of the various evaluations, and they help interpret the results.</p>
<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm360969296">To put this in context, think about how you will spend your weekend. First, you are the manager of your own time. You must plan based on your workload and on how much time you will spend studying, exercising, sleeping, and meeting with friends. You then control how your plan is implemented by setting self-imposed or possibly group meeting–imposed deadlines, and last, you evaluate how well you carried out your plan by gathering more data—such as grades on assignments, personal fulfillment, and number of hours of sleep—to determine if you met your plans (goals). Not planning, controlling, and evaluating often results in less-than-desirable outcomes, such as late assignments, too little sleep, or bad grades. In this scenario, you did not need a separate managerial accountant to help you with these functions, because you could manage planning, controlling, and evaluating on your own. However, in the business world, most businesses will have both managers and managerial accountants. <a href="#auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm368571168" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates some examples.</p>

<li>The purpose of managerial accounting is to supply financial and nonfinancial information to the organization’s management and other internal decision makers.</li>
<li>Most of the job responsibilities of a manager fit into one of three categories: planning, controlling, and evaluating.</li>
<li>Planning involves setting goals and forming the plans to achieve those goals.</li>
<li>Controlling involves the day-to-day activities. Its purpose is to help in planning functions and to facilitate coordination within the organization.</li>
<li>Evaluation determines whether plans are being followed and whether progress is being made as planned toward the fulfillment of organizational goals and objectives. It also involves taking corrective measures in case of deviations identified in the course of action.</li>

<p id="auto_ded7691c-5680-46e3-9f92-e5e72961e2d4_fs-idm374093136">Answers will vary but should include the following: Managers must determine what modifications and changes need to be made to operations to get back on track to meet the stated goals and objectives. Managers need to decide if stated goals and objectives should continue to be pursued as they are, or if they should be modified or completely scrapped. Examples may include revising inventory controls to include antitheft tags that trigger an alarm when inventory is moved from an approved location in order to reduce inventory losses; installing more cameras in more strategic locations to further reduce theft from shoplifting; revising the financial metrics such as ratios or other performance measurements to provide more meaningful and timely insight to help determine how to get back on track; investigating why market share has not changed as expected by talking to the sales force and analyzing market data; evaluating same-store sales to understand how to expand sales in accordance with goals and objectives; and investigating why a production process has experienced a bottleneck and how to relieve the pressure in that specific area, such as making sure appropriate raw materials are available in a timely manner to avoid machine shutdowns waiting on materials to arrive.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm378289696">Now that you have a basic understanding of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">managerial accounting</span>, consider how it is similar to and different from <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">financial accounting</span>. After completing a financial accounting class, many students do not look forward to another semester of debits, credits, and journal entries. Thankfully, managerial accounting is much different from financial accounting. Also known as <em data-effect="italics">management accounting</em> or <em data-effect="italics">cost accounting</em>, managerial accounting provides information to managers and other users within the company in order to make more informed decisions. The overriding roles of managers (planning, controlling, and evaluating) lead to the distinction between financial and managerial accounting. The main objective of management accounting is to provide useful information to managers to assist them in the planning, controlling, and evaluating roles.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm347894064">Unlike managerial accounting, financial accounting is governed by rules set out by the <span data-type="term">Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)</span>, an independent board made up of accounting professionals who determine and publicize the standards of financial accounting and reporting in the United States. Larger, publicly traded companies are also governed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in the form of the <span data-type="term">generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)</span>, the common set of rules, standards, and procedures that publicly traded companies must follow when they are composing their financial statements.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm366211152">Financial accounting provides information to enable stockholders, creditors, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions. This information can be used to evaluate and make decisions for an individual company or to compare two or more companies. However, the information provided by financial accounting is primarily historical and therefore is not sufficient and is often synthesized too late to be overly useful to management. Managerial accounting has a more specific focus, and the information is more detailed and timelier. Managerial accounting is not governed by GAAP, so there is unending flexibility in the types of reports and information gathered. Managerial accountants regularly calculate and manage “what-if” scenarios to help managers make decisions and plan for future business needs. Thus, managerial accounting focuses more on the future, while financial accounting focuses on reporting what has already happened. In addition, managerial accounting uses nonfinancial data, whereas financial accounting relies solely on financial data.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm372719536">For example, Daryn’s Dairy makes many different organic dairy products. Daryn’s managers need to track their costs for certain jobs. One of the company’s top-selling ice creams is their seasonal variety; a new flavor is introduced every three months and sold for only a six-month period. The cost of these specialty ice creams is different from the cost of the standard flavors for reasons such as the unique or expensive ingredients and the specialty packaging. Daryn wants to compare the costs involved in making the specialty ice cream and those involved in making the standard flavors of ice cream. This analysis will require that Daryn track not only the cost of materials that go into the product, but also the labor hours and cost of the labor, plus other costs, known as overhead costs (rent, electricity, insurance, etc.), that are incurred in producing the various ice creams. Once the total costs for both the specialty ice cream and the standard flavored ice cream are known, the cost per unit can be determined for each type. These types of analyses help a company evaluate how to set pricing, evaluate the need for new or substitute ingredients, manage product additions and deletions, and make many other decisions. <a href="#auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_OSX_Acct_M01_02_DarynDairy" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows an example of a materials cost analysis by Daryn’s Dairy used to compare the materials cost for producing 500 gallons of their best-selling standard flavor—vanilla—with one of their specialty ice creams—Very Berry Biscotti.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm319270608">The information generated from the reports of financial accountants tends to be used primarily by <span data-type="term">external users</span>, including the creditors, tax authorities and regulators, investors, customers, competitors, and others outside the company, who rely on the financial statements and annual reports to access information about a company in order to make more informed decisions. Since these external people do not have access to the documents and records used to produce the financial statements, they depend on Generally Applied Accounting Principles (GAAP). These outside users also depend greatly on the preparation of audits that are done by public accounting firms, under the guidelines and standards of either the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).</p>
<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm357610832">Managerial accounting information is gathered and reported for a more specific purpose for <span data-type="term">internal users</span>, those inside the company or organization who are responsible for managing the company’s business interests and executing decisions. These internal users may include management at all levels in all departments, owners, and other employees. For example, in the budget development process, a company such as <strong class="colored-text">Tesla</strong> may want to project the costs of producing a new line of automobiles. The managerial accountants could create a budget to estimate the costs, such as parts and labor, and after the manufacturing process has begun, they can measure the actual costs, thus determining if they are over or under their budgeted amounts. Although outside parties might be interested in this information, companies like <strong class="colored-text">Tesla</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">Microsoft</strong>, and <strong class="colored-text">Boeing</strong> spend significant amounts of time and money to keep their proprietary information secret. Therefore, these internal budget reports are only available to the appropriate users. While you can find a cost of goods sold schedule in the financial statements of publicly traded companies, it is difficult for outside parties to break it down in order to identify the individual costs of products and services.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm357608064">Financial accounting information is communicated through <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">reporting</span>, such as the financial statements. The financial statements typically include a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, retained earnings statement, and footnotes. Managerial accounting information is communicated through reporting as well. However, the reports are more detailed and more specific and can be customized. One example of a managerial accounting report is a budget analysis (variance report) as shown in <a href="#auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_OSX_Acct_M01_02_BudVarAn" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Other reports can include cost of goods manufactured, job order cost sheets, and production reports. Since managerial accounting is not governed by GAAP or other constraints, it is important for the creator of the reports to disclose all assumptions used to make the report. Since the reports are used internally, and not typically released to the general public, the presentation of any assumptions does not have to follow any industry-wide guidelines. Each organization is free to structure its reports in the format that organizes its information in the best way for it.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm357602112">The financial statements are typically generated quarterly and annually, although some entities also require monthly statements. Much work is involved in creating the financial statements, and any adjustments to accounts must be made before the statements can be produced. A physical count inventory must be done to adjust the inventory and cost of goods sold accounts, depreciation must be calculated and entered, all prepaid asset accounts must be reviewed for adjustments, and so forth. The annual reports are not finalized for several weeks after the year-end, because they are based on historical data; for a company that is traded on one of the major or regional stock exchanges, it must have an audit of the financial statements conducted by an independent certified public accountant. This audit cannot be completed until after the end of the company’s fiscal year, because the auditors need access to all of the information for the company for that year. For companies that are privately held, an audit is not normally required. However, potential lenders might require an independent audit.</p>
<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm360956864">Conversely, managers can quickly attain managerial accounting information. No external, independent auditors are needed, and it is not necessary to wait until the year-end. Projections and estimates are adequate. Managers should understand that in order to obtain information quickly, they must accept less precision in the reporting. While there are several reports that are created on a regular basis (e.g., budgets and variance reports), many management reports are produced on an as-needed basis.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm357598704">The general purpose of financial statement <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">reporting</span> is to provide information about the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of an organization. This data is useful to a wide range of users in order to make economic decisions. The purpose of the reporting done by management accountants is more specific to internal users. Management accountants make available the information that could assist companies in increasing their performance and profitability. Unlike financial reports, management reporting centers on components of the business. By dividing the business into smaller sections, a company is able to get into the details and analyze the smallest segments of the business.</p>
<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm357597072">An understanding of managerial accounting will assist anyone in the business world in determining and understanding product costs, analyzing break-even points, and budgeting for expenses and future growth (which will be covered in other parts of this course). As a manager, chief executive officer, or owner, you need to have information available at hand to answer these types of questions:</p>
<ul id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm357596288" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>Are my profits higher this quarter over last quarter?</li>
<li>Do I have enough cash flow to pay my employees?</li>
<li>Are my jobs priced correctly?</li>
<li>Are my products priced correctly in order for me to make the profit I need to make?</li>
<li>Who are my most productive and least productive employees?</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm366780464">In the world of business, information is power; stated simply, the more you know, typically, the better your decisions can be. Managerial accounting delivers data-driven feedback for these decisions that can assist in improving decision-making over the long term. Business managers can leverage this powerful tool in order to make their businesses more successful, because management accounting adds value to common business decision-making. All of this readily available information can lead to great improvements for any business.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm319163440">Because financial accounting typically focuses on the company as a whole, external users of this information choose to invest or loan money to the entire company, not to a department or division within the company. Therefore, the global focus of financial accounting is understandable.</p>
<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm319162752">However, the focus of management accounting is typically different. Managerial reporting is more focused on divisions, departments, or any component of a business, down to individuals. The mid-level and lower-level managers are typically responsible for smaller subsets within the company.</p>
<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm319162064">Managers need accounting reports that deal specifically with their division and their specific activities. For instance, production managers are responsible for their specific area and the results within their division. Accordingly, these production managers need information about results achieved in their division, as well as individual results of departments within the division. The company can be broken into segments based on what managers need—for example, geographic location, product line, customer demographics (e.g., gender, age, race), or any of a variety of other divisions.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm359947616">Both financial reports and managerial reports use <span data-type="term">monetary accounting information</span>, or information relating to money or currency. Financial reports use data from the accounting system that is gathered from the reporting of transactions in the form of journal entries and then aggregated into financial statements. This information is monetary in nature. Managerial accounting uses some of the same financial information as financial accounting, but much of that information will be broken down to a more detailed level. For example, in financial reporting, net sales are needed for the income statement. In managerial accounting, the quantity and dollar value of the sales of each product are likely more useful. In addition, managerial accounting uses a significant amount of <span data-type="term">nonmonetary accounting information</span>, such as quantity of material, number of employees, number of hours worked, and so forth, which does not relate to money or currency.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm319158752">Financial reports rely on structure. They are generated using accepted principles that are enforced through a vast set of rules and guidelines, also known as GAAP. As mentioned previously, companies that are publicly traded are required to have their financial statements audited on an annual basis, and companies that are not publicly traded also may be required to have their financial statements audited by their creditors. The information generated by the management accountants is intended for internal use by the company’s divisions, departments, or both. There are no rules, guidelines, or principles to follow. Managerial accounting is much more flexible, so the design of the managerial accounting system is difficult to standardize, and standardization is unnecessary. It depends on the nature of the industry. Different companies (even different managers within the same company) require different information. The most important issue is whether the reporting is useful for the planning, controlling, and evaluation purposes.</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm375560496">Suppose you have been hired by Daryn’s Dairy as a market analyst. Your first assignment is to evaluate the sales of various standard and specialty ice creams within the Midwest region where Daryn’s Dairy operates. You also need to determine the best-selling flavors of ice cream in other regions of the United States as well as the selling patterns of the flavors. For example, do some flavors sell better than others at different times of the year, or are some top sellers sold as limited-edition flavors? Remember that one of the strategic goals of the company is to increase market share, and the first step in meeting this goal is to sell their product in 10 percent more stores within their current market, so your research will help upper-level management carry out the company’s goals. Where would you gather the information? What type of information would you need? Where would you find this information? How would the company determine the impact of this type of change on the business? If implemented, what information would you need to assess the success of the plan?</p>

<p id="auto_f8a23f15-804a-4b3a-9085-656f31c0e167_fs-idm368185328">Reports generated from financial accounting are a compilation of a company’s various transactions and contain aggregated information for the entire company in the form of financial statements. For publicly traded companies, these reports follow the rules set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). In addition, the financial statements are verified by external auditors. Reports generated by managerial accounting are varied in nature because they are driven by the questions that need to be addressed by management. Different companies and different questions require different reports. Managerial accounting reports are therefore on a more detailed level, such as on a product or division level. There are no specific rules guiding the creation of these reports, and they are usually unaudited.</p>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm273707056">It is clear that management accountants must have a solid foundation in accounting, in both financial and managerial accounting, but other than accounting skills, what makes good managerial accountants?</p>

<ul id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm252780128" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>They must have knowledge of the business in which they are working. <span data-type="term">Commercial awareness</span> is knowing how a business is run and how it is influenced by the external environment and knowing and understanding the overall industry within which the business is operating.</li>
<li><span data-type="term">Collaboration</span>, which involves working in cross-functional teams and earning the trust and respect of colleagues in order to complete a task, is vital to improving managerial accounting talents. They should be “team players.”</li>
<li>Management accountants should have <span data-type="term">effective communication</span> skills that allow them to convey accounting information in both written and oral forms in a way that the intended audience can understand. Being able to gather the data quickly and accurately is important, but the data is meaningless if it is not presented in an intuitive style that the audience can understand.</li>
<li>Strong technology skills are also essential. These skills include not only accounting and reporting software but also other programs that would assist in automating processes, improving efficiencies, and adding value to the company. For many companies, additional software and accompanying technology are often needed for both their financial and managerial accounting functions. For example, <em data-effect="italics">enterprise resource planning</em> (ERP) systems often play a major role in the creation of comprehensive accounting systems. This additional support is often provided by outside suppliers such as <strong class="colored-text">Hyperion</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">Cognos</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">Sage</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">SAP</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">PeopleSoft</strong>, and <strong class="colored-text">Oracle</strong>.</li>
<li>Managerial accountants must possess extensive analytical skills. They must regularly work with financial analysts and management personnel to find ways to reduce expenses and analyze budgets. These skills include the ability to envision, verbalize, conceptualize, or solve both multifaceted and simplistic problems by making choices that make sense with the given information.</li>
<li>Managerial accountants must have ethics and values. They should be an example to others and encourage them to follow internal control practices and procedures. Ethics is discussed in more detail in <a href="#page_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8">Describe the role of the Institute of Management Accountants and the use of ethical standards</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm265729696">Managers at all levels make many different types of decisions every day, but to make most decisions, they need specific information. Some information is easily obtainable, and some is not. Managers do not always know what information they need or what is available, and they need to know if the decisions they make are having the desired outcome and meeting specific goals.</p>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm274324848">To this point, we’ve described <em data-effect="italics">managerial accounting</em> as a process. The following definition considers it a profession. Management accountants are the individuals who help management with this information. The Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) defines management accounting as “a profession that involves partnering in management decision making, devising planning and performance management systems, and providing expertise in financial reporting and control to assist management in the formulation and implementation of an organization’s strategy.”<a href="#auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm265027328" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm265027328">“Management Accounting Careers.” Institute of Management Accountants. https://www.imanet.org/students/management-accounting-careers?ssopc=1</aside>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm267393040">Management accountants work at various levels of the organization, from the project level to the division level to the controller and chief financial officer. Often, management accountants work where they are needed and not necessarily at corporate headquarters. They tend to be hands-on in the decision-making process. They need many types of information to inform the many decisions they must make.</p>

The structure helps define roles and responsibilities. The organizational charts provide guidance to employees and other stakeholders by outlining the official reporting affiliations that direct the workflow within the organization. If the company is particularly efficient, it also will include contact information within the chart. This is a convenient directory to circulate among employees. It helps them find a particular person in a certain position, or determine whom to speak to about certain areas within the company, or even identify a specific person’s supervisor to report positive or negative work behavior.</p>

The board selects the officers who will implement the policies and strategic goals that the board has set in place. The <span data-type="term">chief executive officer (CEO)</span> is the corporation officer who has the overall responsibility for the management of the company. The person overseeing all of the accounting and finance concerns is the <span data-type="term">chief financial officer (CFO)</span>. This individual is in charge of the financial planning and record-keeping of the organization and reports to the CEO. The <span data-type="term">controller</span> is responsible for the accounting side of the business (accounting records, financial statements, tax returns, and internal reports) and reports to the CFO. Also reporting to the CFO is the <span data-type="term">treasurer</span>, who is in control of the finance side of the business (cash position, corporation funds). An additional area that sometimes falls under the control of the CFO is the internal audit staff. Internal auditors supply independent assurance that a company’s internal control processes are effective. However, there is strong support for keeping the internal audit staff outside of the CFO, because of a possible conflict of interest.</p>

Its year-end is December 31. Because of poor cash flow management, the CFO has some concerns about having enough cash to be able to pay the tax bill that is expected. In early December, the purchasing department bought excess hops, barley, malt, oats, and yeast in anticipation of brewing more beer for the holiday and Super Bowl seasons. In order to decrease the company’s net income, thereby reducing their taxable income, the CFO tells you to enter the purchase of this inventory as part of the “Supplies Expense” in the current year.</p>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm271219072">The field of managerial accounting, or corporate accounting, is composed of the financial and accounting responsibilities required to operate any type of business. Managerial accountants are employed within organizations to monitor costs, sales, budgets, and spending; conduct audits; predict future requirements; and aid the executive leaders of the organization with financial decision-making.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm269185552"><a href="#auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_OSX_Acct_M01_03_Salaries" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> lists approximate salaries for several financial and managerial accounting employment positions. In reviewing the salary information, be aware that there are often major variances in salaries based on geographical locations. For example, a cost accountant manager in San Francisco, California, would typically be paid significantly more than an accountant in a similar position in Fayetteville, Arkansas. However, the cost of living, especially housing costs, in San Francisco is also significantly higher than the cost of living in Fayetteville.</p>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm274315904">Managerial accountants find employment opportunities in a wide variety of settings and industries. Professionals in this discipline are in high demand from public and private companies, government agencies, and not-for-profit entities (NFPs). Some areas of management accounting are versatile to any sector (corporate, government, or NFP).</p>
<ul id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm200611040" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>A <span data-type="term">financial analyst</span> assists in preparing budgets, tracking actual costs, examining task performance, scrutinizing different types of variances, and supporting other management personnel in organizing forecasts and projections.</li>
<li>A <span data-type="term">budget analyst</span> arranges and manages the master budget and compares master budget projections to actual results. This individual must be vastly aware of all operations in the budget and work closely with the rest of the accounting staff as well as management personnel.</li>
<li>An <span data-type="term">internal auditor</span> typically reports to high-level executives within the company. An internal auditor is often called on to investigate budget variances, industrial sabotage, poor work quality, fraud, and theft. He or she also safeguards the internal controls and confirms they are working and effective.</li>
<li>A <span data-type="term">cash-management accountant</span> has responsibilities that include transferring monies between accounts, monitoring deposits and payments, reconciling cash balances, creating and tracking cash forecasts, and performing all other cash-related financial processes.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm275583616">Other areas of managerial accounting are specific to the sector in which accountants work. For example, the area of cost accounting is more specific to the corporate or manufacturing sector. These <span data-type="term">cost accountants</span> amass large sums of data, checking for accuracy and then formulating the cost of raw materials, work in process, finished goods, labor, overhead, and other associated manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm275193152">Governmental entities also use accounting to communicate with their constituents. <span data-type="term">Government agencies</span> include all levels of government, federal, state, county, and city, including military, law enforcement, airports, and school systems. Government accountants deal with budgets, auditing, and payroll, the same as all other managerial accountants. However, they must follow a different set of accounting rules called the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm259015584"><span data-type="term">Nonprofit (not-for-profit) organizations</span> are tax-exempt organizations that serve their communities in a variety of areas, such as religion, education, social services, health care, and the arts. Managerial accountants in this area are most often focused on budgets. The biggest difference between a corporate budget analyst and a nonprofit budget analyst is that the nonprofit analyst works the budget backward, compared to the corporate analyst. For example, if a corporation was selling widgets, its budget would start with a sales forecast of how many widgets the company thinks it can sell. This gives the company a forecast of how much it can spend on expenses and fixed assets. The nonprofit budget analysts often start with the expenses. They forecast how much the expenses will be in order to continue to offer their service to the community. From there, they then adjust how much they will need to obtain through fundraising, donations, grants, or other sources to meet their expenses.</p>

<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm269379744">There are many distinct accounting certifications that accountants can earn in order to improve their careers, attain promotions, and acquire raises in their pay. The certifications are somewhat different from each other and focused toward different career paths. Many accountants have more than one of these credentials to diversify their paths.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm269987392">The <span data-type="term">Certified Public Accountant (CPA)</span> is considered the top tier in accounting certifications. Many companies or positions require CPA certification. For example, most employees at accounting firms earn a CPA certificate within the first few of years of graduation. Some positions, such as controller or CFO, often require CPA certification. In the United States, each state has different educational and experience requirements in order to obtain the CPA. The certification requires passing the four-part CPA exam as well. This is administered by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). There are four parts to the exam: Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR), Auditing and Attestation (AUD), Regulation (REG), and Business Environment and Concepts (BEC). Each part is graded on a 100-point scale. A score of seventy-five or greater must be achieved in order to pass each section. The exams can be intimidating, as it is a difficult process to go through. As of 2017, the AICPA reported a pass rate of less than 50 percent, which may contribute to its high regard around the world. After passing the CPA exam, candidates must work for one year under the supervision of a licensed CPA before their own license is approved by a state regulatory agency. Those certified in public accounting work in all areas of accounting. However, do not assume that being a CPA is the only way to secure an excellent position in accounting.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm246057120">The <span data-type="term">Certified Management Accountant (CMA)</span> is another top-tiered certification for accountants. The CMA title identifies the individual as a specialist in corporate accounting management. The CMA has some overlap with the CPA, but the CPA is focused more on compliance, tax, and controls. CMAs favor financial analytics, budgeting, and strategic assessment. This certification requires the minimum of a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university, two years of work experience, and successfully passing both parts of the exam. Part one of the exam covers financial reporting, planning, performance, and controls. Part two focuses on financial decision-making. The exam is administered by the IMA and has a 50 percent passing rate globally.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm276613776">Not as popular in the United States as the CPA, the <span data-type="term">Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)</span> certification is more in demand throughout Europe and Asia. This certification prepares accountants for a career in the finance and investment domains. Requirements of this credential include a bachelor’s degree or four years’ worth of experience, plus passing all three sections of the exam. The exam is administered by the CFA Institute. There are three separate exams, each one taking up to six hours to complete. The exams must be completed in succession. This credential is considered one of the more rigorous ones to obtain, with a passing rate of less than 45 percent.</p><p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm273937328">The <span data-type="term">Enrolled Agent (EA)</span> credential focuses on a career in taxation, whether it is working in tax preparation for the public, internally for a corporation, or for the government at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The EA certification was created by the IRS to signify significant knowledge of the US tax code and the ability to apply the concepts of that code. Enrolled agents have the privilege of being able to sign tax returns as paid preparers, and they are able to represent their clients in front of the IRS. The EA certification can be obtained by passing a three-part exam covering all types of individual and business tax returns. Once the certification is obtained, enrolled agents must follow strict ethical standards and complete 72 hours of continuing education courses every three years.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm267756672">The <span data-type="term">Certified Internal Auditor (CIA)</span> is a credential offered by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and is one of the only certifications that is accepted worldwide. CIAs tend to be employed in auditing areas within government agencies, banking, finance, or corporations. They examine financial documents to investigate deficiencies in internal controls. Requirements for this certification include a bachelor’s degree, two years of work experience in a related field, and passing the three sections of the examination. Also required are providing character references, following a code of ethics, and continuing education.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm270992272">The <span data-type="term">Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE)</span> certification signifies proven proficiency in fraud prevention, detection, and deterrence. CFEs are instructed in how to identify the red flags that may indicate fraudulent actions. The designation is awarded by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) after applicants have met the following requirements: bachelor’s degree, two years of work-related experience, moral character references, and the passing of four separate exams.</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm245612960">The <span data-type="term">Certified Government Auditing Professional (CGAP)</span> designation is exclusively for auditors employed throughout the public sector (federal, state, local) and is offered by the IIA. Requirements for this credential are the same as for the CIA. The exam has 115 multiple-choice questions and covers four areas focusing on proficiency in generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).</p>
<p id="auto_ace4dad8-8fa2-4368-8255-d91db85d616c_fs-idm265233904">These certifications lead to different job responsibilities and different career paths. As indicated, each of the certifications requires varying degrees of education and has exams that are unique to that particular certification. All of these certifications also require a certain number of hours of continuing education in order to keep the certification active. This ensures that the certificate holder is up to date on changes in the field. There are always many opportunities throughout the year to obtain continuing education credits through seminars, webinars, symposiums, and online and in-person classes.</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm357031536">As you’ve learned, unlike the specific rules set forth by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">GAAP</span> and the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">SEC</span> that govern financial accounting, managerial accounting does not have specific rules and is considered flexible, as the reporting stays internal and does not need to follow external rules. Managers of a business need detailed information in a timely manner. This means that a managerial accountant needs to understand many detailed aspects of how the company operates in addition to financial accounting methods, because the framework of typical management reports often comes from the financial statements. However, the reports can be individualized and customized to the information the manager is seeking. Each company has different strategies, timing, and needs for information.</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm386589648">The <span data-type="term">Institute of Management Accountants (IMA)</span>, the professional organization for management accountants, provides research, education, a means of knowledge sharing, and practice development to its members. The IMA also issues the Certified Management Accountant (CMA) certification to those accountants who meet the educational requirements, pass the rigorous two-part exam, and maintain continuing professional education requirements. The CMA exam covers essential managerial accounting topics as well as topics on economics and finance. Many accountants hold both CMA and CPA certifications.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm352784736"><h3 data-type="title">Business Ethics</h3>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm356789664">The IMA also develops standards and principles to help management accountants deal with ethical challenges. Trust is an important cornerstone of business interactions, both internal and external. When there is a lack of trust, it changes how decisions are made. Trust develops when there are good <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">ethics</span>: when people know right from wrong. Consider these three questions as put forth by the Institute of Business Ethics: (1) Do I mind others knowing what I have done? (2) Who does my decision affect or hurt? (3) Would my decision be considered fair to those affected? These questions can help evaluate the ethics of a decision.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm401206224">Ethics is more than simply obeying laws; it involves doing the right thing as well as the legal thing. Many companies have a code of conduct to help guide their employees. For example, <strong class="colored-text">Google</strong> has a code of ethics that they expect all of their employees and board members to follow. Failing to do so can cause termination of employment. The preface of the code includes “Don’t be evil.” They use that to show all employees and other shareholders within Google that they are serious about ethics—that trust and respect are essential in providing a great service to their customers.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm526998640">The IMA has its own Statement of Ethical Professional Practice for its members. Managerial accountants should never commit acts that violate the standards of ethics, and they should never ignore such deeds by others within their companies. Many other professional organizations, across many different professions, have codes of ethics. For example, there are codes of ethics for the AICPA, ACFE, Financial Executives International, American Marketing Association, National Society of Professional Engineers, and the American Nurses Association.</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm391013584">Four standards of ethical conduct in management accountants’ professional activities were developed by the Institute of Management Accountants. The four standards are competence, confidentiality, integrity, and credibility. Credibility is a key standard that is based on an accountant communicating information with fairness and objectivity, disclosing all information that is relevant to the intended users understanding, and disclosing “delays or deficiencies in information, timeliness, processing, or internal controls in conformance with organization policy and/or applicable law.”<a href="#auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm355366848" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm355366848">Institute of Management Accountants. “Standards of Ethical Conduct for Management Accountants.” AccountingVerse. https://www.accountingverse.com/managerial-accounting/introduction/code-of-ethics.html</aside>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm402128464">Often, when we think of unethical behavior, we imagine large-scale scenarios involving tens of thousands of dollars or more, but ethical issues are more likely faced on a small scale. For example, suppose you work for an organization that makes and sells virtual reality headsets. Because of competition, your company has decreased their forecasted sales for next year by 20 percent over the current year. In a meeting, the CEO expressed concern over the effect of the decreased sales on the bonuses of upper-level executives, since their bonus is tied to meeting income projections. The vice president of marketing suggested in the meeting that if the company simply continued to produce the same number of headsets as they had in the previous year, income levels may still be achieved in order for the bonuses to be awarded. This would involve the company producing excess inventory with hopes of selling them, in order to achieve income levels sufficiently adequate to be able to pay bonuses to executives. While a conflict of interest might not be intuitively obvious, the company (and thus its managerial accountants) has an obligation to many stakeholders such as investors, creditors, employees and the community. The obligation of a corporation to these stakeholders depends somewhat on the stakeholder. For example, the primary obligation to a creditor may be to make timely payments, the obligation to the community may be to minimize negative environmental impact. Most stakeholders to not have access to internal information or decisions and thus rely on management to be ethical in their decision-making. The company may indeed be able to sell all that it produces, but given the forecasted drop in sales, producing the same number of units as during the current year will likely lead to unsellable inventory, the need to sell the units at a significant discount in order to dispose of them, or both. Following the recommendation to produce more than forecasted sales might hurt the value of the company’s stock, which could hurt many categories of stakeholders who depend on the accountants and financial analysts to protect their financial interests.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm379693584">In addition to managing production and inventory, a budget and the entire budget process have an impact on managerial decision-making. Suppose you are the manager of the research department of a pharmaceutical company. Your budget includes the costs for various types of training for your staff. Because of the amount of time spent in development of a highly promising medication to treat diabetes, your staff has not had time to complete as much training during the current year as you had allowed for in the budget. You are concerned that if you do not use the training money, your training budget will be decreased in the next budget cycle. To prevent this from happening, you arrange for several online training sessions for your staff. These training sessions are on the basics of laboratory safety. All of your staff is very experienced and current on this topic and can likely go straight to the course completion quiz and complete it in a matter of minutes without actually watching any of the ten modules. What would encourage a manager to schedule and spend money on training that is not useful for the employees? While it is expected to stay within the budget, many managers will spend any “excess” amounts remaining in the budget at the end of the fiscal year. This practice is known as “use it or lose it.” Managers do this to avoid having their budgets cut in the next fiscal year. Stated simply, management spends everything in their budget regardless of the value added or the necessity. This is not ethical behavior and is usually the result of a budgetary process that needs to be modified so that the possibility of being able to pad the budget is removed or at least minimized.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm384106944">All employees within a company are expected to act ethically within their business actions. This can sometimes be difficult when the company itself almost promotes the idea of unethical actions. For example, <strong class="colored-text">Wells Fargo</strong> started offering incentives to their employees who succeeded in selling to current customers other services and products that the bank had to offer. This incentive created an unethical culture. Employees manufactured fake accounts, credit cards, and other services in order to qualify for the bonuses. In the end, 5,300 employees lost their jobs, and everyone learned a lesson on creating proper incentives. Executives who aspire to run an ethical company can do so, if they change reward systems from “pay for performance” to more holistic values. Examples of proper incentives include attendance rewards, merit rewards, team bonuses, overall profit sharing, and stock options.</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm355528016">Most, if not all, major corporations have a code of ethics or a code of conduct. Read <a href="https://openstax.org/l/50GoogleCode">Google’s Code of Conduct</a> and consider the following questions:</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm373810960">In response to several corporate scandals, the United States Congress passed the <span data-type="term">Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)</span>, also known as the “public company accounting reform.” It is a federal law (http://www.soxlaw.com/) that was a far-reaching reform of business practices. Its focus is primarily on public accounting firms that act as auditors of publicly traded corporations. The act intended to protect investors by enhancing the accuracy and reliability of corporate financial statements and disclosures. Thousands of corporations now must confirm that their accounting processes comply with SOX. The act itself is fairly detailed, but the most significant issues for compliance are as follows:</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm355591440">Individuals who work throughout the accounting profession have a significant responsibility to the general public. Financial accountants deliver information about companies that the public uses to make major financial decisions. There must be a level of trust and confidence in the ethical behavior of these accountants. Just like others in the business world, accountants are confronted endlessly with ethical dilemmas. A high standard of ethical behavior is expected of those employed in a profession. While ethical codes are helpful guidelines, the rationale to act ethically must originate from within oneself, from personal morals and values. There are steps that can provide an outline for examining ethical issues:</p>
<ol id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm393119456" type="1">
<li>Recognize the ethical issue at hand and those involved (employees, creditors, vendors, and community).</li>
<li>Establish the facts of the situation (who, what, where, when, and how).</li>
<li>Recognize the competing values related to the issue (confidentiality and conflict of interest).</li>
<li>Determine alternative courses of action (do not limit yourself).</li>
<li>Evaluate each course of action and how each relates to the values in step 3.</li>
<li>Recognize the possible consequences of each course of action and how each affects those involved in step 1.</li>
<li>Make a decision, and take a course of action.</li>
<li>Evaluate the decision. (Is the issue solved? Did it create other issues?)</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm404964688">You are about to sign a new client to a very large contract worth over $900,000. Your supervisor is under a lot of pressure to increase sales. He calls you into his office and tells you his future with the company is in jeopardy, and he asks you to include the revenue for the new contract in the sales figures for the quarter that ends today. You know the contract is a certainty, but the client is out of town and cannot possibly sign for at least a week. Use the eight steps in examining an ethical situation to determine how you would react to this situation.</p>
</div>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm384042864">One of the issues with ethics is that what one person, community, or even country considers unethical or wrong may not be problematic for another person, community, or country, who see it as a way of doing business. For example, <span data-type="term">bribery</span> in the world of business happens when an organization or representative of an organization gives money or other financial benefits to another individual, business, or official in order to gain favor or to manipulate a business decision. Bribery in the United States is illegal. However, in Russia or China, a bribe is sometimes one cost of doing business, so it is part of their culture and completely ordinary.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm397234160">The <span data-type="term">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)</span> was implemented in 1977 in the aftermath of disclosures of bribery of foreign bureaucrats by more than 400 US corporations. The law is broken down into two parts: the antibribery section and the accounting section. The antibribery section specifically prohibits payments to foreign government officials to aid in attaining or retaining business. This provision applies to all US persons and foreign firms acting within the United States. It also requires corporations that are listed in the United States to converge their accounting records with certain accounting provisions. These include making and keeping records that fairly represent the transactions of the company and maintaining an acceptable system of internal controls. Companies doing business outside the United States are obligated to follow this law and dedicate resources to its compliance.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm398105728">The accounting section of the FCPA requires a company to have good internal controls so a slush fund to pay bribes cannot be created and maintained. A <em data-effect="italics">slush fund</em> is a cash account that is often created for illegal activities or payments that are not typically recorded on the books.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm386815088">More details on the SOX and the FCPA are covered in such courses as auditing, intermediate accounting, cost accounting, and business law.</p>

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm392985280">As a corporate accountant, it is very important to understand both financial and managerial aspects of the company and industry in which you are working. In order to assist management in their roles of planning, controlling, and evaluating, an accountant needs to be aware not only of GAAP but also of the products or services offered by the company, the processes by which those products or services are produced, and pertinent facts about suppliers, customers, and competitors. Not having this knowledge not only makes it more difficult for the corporate or managerial accountant to perform any assigned duties, but there is also an ethical responsibility to be knowledgeable in order to offer assistance, analysis, or recommendations to management or customers.</p>
<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm388666016">Assume you have been hired by <strong class="colored-text">Triumph Motorcycles</strong> as a new logistics analyst.

<p id="auto_cec5087c-91c4-4730-a0a6-1ac084fd38a8_fs-idm366287936">Ways to learn about the company and industry include the company website, press or news releases, industry trade journals, company internal documents such as procedure manuals and job descriptions, and conversations or interviews with fellow employees at various levels of the organization. The more knowledge you have regarding financial and managerial accounting, the better you can link the operations of the organizations to financial results and the more easily you can ascertain both efficiencies and inefficiencies in the organization.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm231652432">The business environment never rests. Regulations are always changing, global competition continues to increase, and technology provides continual disruption. Management accounting is always evolving due to changes in the business environment. The types of information needed and obtainable have changed significantly over time.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm240387840">Many areas of employment are impacting businesses and the managerial accounting function today. For example, more than 60 percent of workers in the United States are employed within service industries, such as government agencies, marketing firms, accounting firms, and airlines. The health-care and social service industries have doubled in size. However, as the number of service jobs has increased, the number of manufacturing jobs, as a percentage of all jobs, has been decreasing.<a href="#auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm230321408" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a> One of the primary reasons for the decline in manufacturing jobs is automation and other technological changes.</p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm230321408">Dr. Patricia Buckley. “Geographic Trends in Manufacturing Job Creation: Something Old, Something New.” <em data-effect="italics">Deloitte Insight</em>. September 25, 2017. https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/economy/behind-the-numbers/geographic-trends-in-manufacturing-job-creation.html</aside>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm213867072">How are service industries different from manufacturing organizations? The fundamental difference is the product they sell. The service company, such as a marketing, legal, or consulting firm, produces <span data-type="term">intangible goods</span>, meaning that the product has no physical substance. Manufacturing companies produce <span data-type="term">tangible goods</span>, which customers can handle and see. This leads to another significant difference between manufacturing companies and service firms: inventory. Service firms, unlike manufacturing, do not have large inventories, because there is no tangible product. Manufacturing will have inventories of raw materials, of goods that are in the process of being produced and goods that have been completed but not yet sold. Managerial accountants must track all of this information for manufacturing companies. However, managerial accountants are still needed within service-based firms to track time, materials, and overhead. For example, Boeing Company is a manufacturer of airplanes. Their accountants must track several different types of inventory categories, direct labor, and overhead costs, among other things. One of Boeing’s customers, <strong class="colored-text">Delta Air Lines</strong>, is a service-based company. The managerial accountants for the airline also are responsible for following costs, but their reports are targeted toward industry-specific measures such as operating margins, revenue from passenger miles, load factors, and passenger yield, among others.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm234874576">Much of managerial accounting focuses on manufacturing. However, the techniques used for cost accounting for manufacturing companies also can be applied to service-based organizations. The former would develop a cost of goods manufactured schedule, and the latter would need a cost of service schedule. The structure of the reports is principally the same, but section headings would reflect the type of organization.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm194293440"><h3 data-type="title">Technology</h3>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm234385808">Business entities always look for ways to leverage <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">technology</span>. Any type of technology that can increase production, reduce costs, or increase safety will attract attention from the business world. There are many areas of technology that businesses have used already, but to continue reaping those benefits, these companies need to adjust quickly with the ever-advancing business technology.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm219602400">Companies have the ability to integrate many of their business processes through <span data-type="term">enterprise resource planning (ERP)</span> systems, which help companies streamline their operations and help management respond quickly to change. Although they are expensive, these systems help alleviate the complications that arise from business systems that do not coordinate with one another. For example, a company may have many different individual systems for each function: human resources may have a system to track employees’ insurance benefits, training, and retirement programs, while payroll may have a program that tracks employees’ earnings, taxes, deductions, and direct deposit information. Much of the information human resources and payroll collect is the same. Having one system with different silos is much more efficient than having two separate systems. Management must be aware of and adapt to whichever type of system that the business has—either one ERP or several independent systems that may not coordinate information (<a href="#auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_OSX_Acct_M01_05_ERP_img" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm213856560">Businesses have been on the forefront of advancing technology. As computer systems developed throughout the twentieth century, they brought with them the potential for many benefits, but the business world needed to adapt and transform their infrastructure. Over the last forty years, tangible assets (buildings, machinery, and vehicles) have declined from 80 percent of a company’s value to 15 percent, while intangible assets (trademarks, patents, and competencies) are now at an average of 85 percent of a company’s value. It can be difficult to put a value on some of the intangible assets, but it is not hard to realize they do have worth. <strong class="colored-text">JetBlue</strong> has the number one brand loyalty of all North American airlines. <strong class="colored-text">Apple</strong> has built a kingdom around brand loyalty. Intangible assets can give a company a competitive edge, entice consumers, and protect the organization’s brain trust.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm242647888">Technological advances can directly affect managerial accounting reports, through estimates of overhead costs. Historically, overhead was typically calculated on the basis of relatively straightforward relationships, such as direct labor costs or direct labor hours. With the advancements through automation, in many instances, direct labor costs are much lower and no longer relevant in computing overhead costs. <span data-type="term">Automation</span> is a method of using systems such as computers or robots to operate different processes and machinery to improve efficiencies and lower direct labor costs. Companies use automation to remove the complex, superfluous stages from a process in order to streamline the practice. In essence, labor is being traded for machine production. Such industries as auto production are excellent examples. This exchange of direct labor for greater costs in overhead for such factors as machinery depreciation will be addressed in <a href="#page_3793c23f-6b7d-447e-8213-14c1a6efe51d">Job Order Costing</a> and <a href="#page_7a51fb77-1243-4806-b8ba-1bb2c90475a7">Process Costing</a> on calculating production costs.</p>

This <a href="https://openstax.org/l/50Ford">100-second video from <strong class="colored-text">Ford Motor Company</strong> on automation</a> demonstrates this concept.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm193901264">With the growth of the Internet and the speed by which information is shared, businesses can now communicate with employees from around the world within seconds. This has made outsourcing common in certain sectors. <span data-type="term">Outsourcing</span> is hiring workers outside of the company who perform their tasks inside or outside of the country. Most of the exported jobs have gone to less-developed countries, where there are lower labor costs. Outsourcing saves the company money on labor and overhead costs and has become a major trend over the past several years. More and more organizations, both large and small, are now using outsourcing as a way of growing their entities without adding additional labor and overhead costs. Outsourcing allows a company to focus on its own competencies and hire those outside sources to handle other duties.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm231723504">Another technology that is quickly becoming widespread is <span data-type="term">radio-frequency identification (RFID)</span>. This technology uses electromagnetic fields to routinely identify and trace inventory tags that have been attached to objects. The tags contain information that has been stored by electronic means. The RFID tags can made into many shapes and sizes and enclosed in many different materials. These tiny devices have advantages over the common bar code. They do not need to be positioned precisely over the scanner and cannot be manipulated like barcodes. This technology has been used for many years in identifying and tracking lost pets, but it was considered too expensive for more extensive use in industry. With the advancements over the last several years, RFID devices are now seen as “throwaway” control devices. One company recently signed a contract to sell 500 million RFID tags at a cost of about ten cents per device. Other current uses include antitheft tags attached to merchandise, credit card chips, and heavy-duty transponders used in shipping containers. New uses being investigated include RFID chips in passports, food, and people.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm239902144">With the increase in global businesses and competition, there has been an increased focus on outsourcing in order to reduce costs. As you’ve learned, outsourcing involves hiring an outside company to provide services or products rather than having them produced internally.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm235496240">For example, you are the vice president of operations for a manufacturing firm. Other firms similar to yours have outsourced some of the product assembly. You estimate that you could save a significant amount of money on wages and benefits, as you would let go approximately ten workers if you outsource. Would you outsource? Why or why not?</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm184708976">All companies want to be successful. This requires continuously trying to improve the function of the organization. A <span data-type="term">lean business model</span> is one in which a company strives to eliminate waste in its products, services, and processes, while still fulfilling the company’s mission. This type of model was originally implemented by the Japanese automaker, <strong class="colored-text">Toyota Motor Corporation</strong>, soon after the end of World War II. The implications of an organization adopting a lean business model can be overall business improvement, but a lean business model can be difficult to implement because it often requires all systems and procedures that an organization follows to be readjusted and coordinated. Managerial accounting plays a vital role in the success and implementation of a lean business model by providing accurate cost and performance evaluation information. Entities must comprehend the nature and sources of costs and develop systems that encapsulate costs accurately. The better an organization is at controlling costs, the more it can improve its overall financial performance. <span data-type="term">Continuous improvement</span> is the manufacturing process that rejects the ideas of “good enough.” It is an ongoing effort to improve processes, products, services, and practices. This philosophy has led organizations to adopt practices such as total quality management, just-in-time manufacturing, and Lean Six Sigma. The fundamental ideas of all of these involve continuous improvement; they differ only in focus.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm204050192"><span data-type="term">Total quality management (TQM)</span> concentrates on quality improvement and applies this benchmark to all aspects of business activities. In TQM, management and employees look to reveal waste and errors, streamline the supply chain, improve customer relations, and confirm that employees are informed and properly trained. The objective of TQM is continuous improvement by concentrating on systematic problem-solving and customer service. Scientific methods are used to study what succeeds and what does not, and then the best practices are implemented throughout the organization.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm230710288">However, the pursuit of total quality will cost the company money. With the help of management accountants, companies can track these costs and forecast whether or not the improvements will eventually save the organization money down the road.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm200136432"><span data-type="term">Just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing</span> is an inventory system that companies use to increase efficiency and decrease waste by receiving goods only as they are needed within the production process, thereby reducing warehousing costs. This method requires accurate forecasting. Managerial accountants work together with purchasing and production schedulers in keeping the flow of materials accurate and efficient.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm214023568">This method was initiated by Toyota Motor Corporation, and it has expanded to many other manufacturing organizations throughout the world. Toyota set the example by controlling their inventory levels by relying on their supply chain to deliver the raw materials it needed to build their cars. The parts arrived just as they were needed, not before or after.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm202898336">One major advantage of JIT manufacturing is reducing costs by eradicating warehouse storage needs. Organizations, in turn, tend to spend less money on raw materials because of a reduction in spoilage and waste. Another advantage is that companies can easily move from the assembly of one product to the assembly of another.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm200007440">Disadvantages of JIT manufacturing start with its complexity. In moving from a traditional manufacturing approach to a JIT approach, management must reconfigure the entire flow of the production process, from the initial use of the raw materials to the output of the final finished good. Another disadvantage of JIT manufacturing is that it makes organizations more susceptible to disruptions in the supply chain. If a supplier of raw materials has a labor strike, weather problems, a breakdown of machinery, or some other catastrophe and cannot deliver the materials on time, that one supplier can shut down an entire production process and delay delivery of finished goods. An example of this occurred in 2011 after a tsunami and earthquake hit Japan and disrupted production at a critical supplier of auto parts. <strong class="colored-text">General Motors (GM)</strong> facilities in the United States announced they would have to shut down assembly plants where they could not continue production without the parts from Japan.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm235434432"><span data-type="term">Lean Six Sigma (LSS)</span> is a quality control program that depends on a combined effort of many team members to enhance performance by analytically removing waste and diminishing variations between products. The <em data-effect="italics">lean</em> component of LSS is the concept that anything that is not needed in a product or service, or any unnecessary steps that exist, add cost to the product or service and therefore should be considered waste and eliminated. The <em data-effect="italics">Six Sigma</em> component of LSS has to do with the elimination of defects. Essentially, as a company becomes leaner, it should also be able to reduce defects in manufacturing or in providing a service. Fewer defects add to cost savings through the need for fewer reworked products, fewer repeat service calls, and therefore, more satisfied customers. It was developed by <strong class="colored-text">Motorola</strong> in 1986 and emphasized cycle-time improvement and the reduction of defects. This process has shown to be a powerful way of improving business efficiency and effectiveness. As organizations continue to modify and update their processes for optimal productivity, they must be flexible. As of 2017, LSS had developed into a business management way of thinking that focused on customer needs, customer retention, and improvement of business products and services. There are many establishments, including Motorola, that now do LSS training. There are certifications including white belt, yellow belt, green belt, black belt, and master black belt. The belts signify an employee’s knowledge regarding LSS. For example, a white belt understands the terminology, structure, and idea of LSS and reports issues to green or black belts. A green belt typically manages LSS projects, and a master black belt works with upper-level management to find the areas in the business where LSS needs to be implemented, leads several LSS teams, and oversees implementation of those projects.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm212625280"><span data-type="term">Kaizen</span> (Japanese for <em data-effect="italics">change for the better</em>) is another process that is often linked to Six Sigma (<a href="#auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_OSX_Acct_M01_05_Kaizen" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The two concepts are often used together for process improvements, as they both are designed for continuous improvement by eliminating waste and increasing efficiencies. The concept of <em data-effect="italics">kaizen</em> comes from an ancient Japanese philosophy that involves continuously working toward perfection in all areas of one’s life. It was adopted in the business world after World War II in an effort to rebuild Japan. It centers on making small, day-to-day changes that develop into major improvements over time. The key behind the success of kaizen comes from requiring all employees—from the CEO at the top, all the way down to the shop-floor janitors—to participate by making recommendations to improve the organization. From the start of the process, it must be well defined that all recommendations are appreciated and that there will be no adverse results for participating. Workers, instead, should be rewarded for any modifications that advance the workplace. Employees become more self-assured and invested when they help improve the company.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm235396368">Another lean practice, the <span data-type="term">theory of constraints (TOC)</span>, involves recognizing and removing bottlenecks within the value chain that may be limiting an organization’s profitability. This philosophy, developed by Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt, is a valuable instrument for improving the flaws in processes. The main goal of this methodology is to remove obstructions, or constraints, which are referred to as “bottlenecks.” There are several types of bottlenecks that organizations must deal with endlessly. One example occurs at the grocery store when it is crowded and there are only three checkout lanes open but ten people in each line. Obviously, the bottleneck is created by having too few checkout lanes open. The bottleneck can be mitigated by opening more checkout lanes.

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm234436608">The <span data-type="term">balanced scorecard (BSC)</span> approach uses both financial and nonfinancial measures in evaluating all attributes of the organization’s procedures. This approach differs from the traditional approach of only using financial measures to evaluate a company. While financial measures are essential, they are only a portion of what needs to be evaluated. The balanced scorecard focuses on both high-level and low-level measures, using the company’s own strategic plan. This method assesses the organization in four separate perspectives:</p>
<ul id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm234188192" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>Financial. The financial measures are the major focus of the BSC—but not the only measures. This perspective asks questions like whether the organization is making money or whether the stockholders are pleased.</li>
<li>Customer. The BSC also evaluates how the organization is perceived, from the customer’s perspective. This measures customer satisfaction, new customer growth, and market share.</li>
<li>Internal process. The internal procedures and processes perspective observes how smoothly things are running. This perspective will examine quality, efficiency, and waste as they relate directly to the products or services.</li>
<li>Learning and growth/capacity. This area evaluates the entity and its performance from the standpoint of human capital, infrastructure, culture, technology, and other areas. Are employees collaborating and sharing information? Does everyone have access to the latest trends in training and continuing education in their areas?</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm212671264">The main advantage of this approach is that it offers organizations a way to see the cause-and-effect in the objectives. For example, if an organization would like to make more money in order to pay higher dividends to its stockholders, the organization will need to increase market share, improve customer satisfaction, or grow its customer base. In order to make customers happier or gain new customers, the organization could try to reduce defects and increase overall quality of the products; to accomplish that, the organization could retrain or offer new training to its employees.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm231006624"><h3 data-type="title">Globalization</h3>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm235478544">The development of business through international influence or extending social and cultural aspects around the world is known as <span data-type="term">globalization</span>. It has expanded our competitive borders, giving customers more alternatives. Customers can order an item from another country with the click of a button and have that item delivered in a few days or less. How has globalization affected companies? Not only must they choose between ordering goods or components globally, but they must decide in which countries to sell their goods, and in which companies they may be able to establish factories.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm200140272">Globalization affects management accountants in several ways. Companies need real-time, accurate information to make good decisions, so more timely and accurate information is needed. As companies expand globally, managers need to know the cost of operating internationally, as well as the laws, rules, and customs. Globalization also can expose companies to improvements in running a business.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm200139472">Debates continue as to the positive and negative consequences of globalization in all of its contexts. The advantages of globalization include helping developing countries in creating jobs, developing industries, differentiating and expanding their markets, and bettering their standard of living for their citizens. Some believe the expansion of pop culture around the globe to be an advantage of cultural globalization. It has multiplied the interchange of ideas, music, art, language, and cultural ideals. On the other side of the debate, one common criticism of globalization is that it has enhanced wealth disparity and, further, that organizations of the Western world have benefited much more than those anywhere else. There is also the argument that globalization is improving standards of living worldwide as industrialization is expanding, but it is causing global warming and climate change, due to the greenhouse gases the factories emit. Additionally, in some areas it has led to the abuse and misuse of natural resources and caused other detrimental consequences.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm231055200">How do these various globalization debates affect businesses? A successful company must be profitable to stay in business, but profitability is not the single key to success. A successful company must also consider the environment in which it operates—culturally, socially, environmentally, and economically—which requires companies to evolve and adjust as each of these environments changes. This evolution means that companies must continually evaluate themselves and their impact on all of their stakeholders, which include investors, creditors, management, employees, customers, governments, and, either directly or indirectly, the world. What companies used as measures of success forty years ago are different from the measures used twenty years ago, and those are different from those that are used today and still different from what will be needed in the future. Management accounting is the area in which many of these changing measures are either generated or evaluated. Such measures not only evaluate the cost effectiveness of products or services, but determine the best way to evaluate and reward employees and evaluate the cost-benefit of environmental protections, the impact of automation versus outsourcing, and the cost of training and educating employees.</p>

Ethics are the principles, and the values that underlie them, that allow us to determine what is right and wrong. According to Gerasimova, ethics fall into three categories: “code and compliance, destiny and values, and social outreach.”<a href="#auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm235280592" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a> In the global business context, she also emphasizes the importance of respecting differences in values held by coworkers, communicating honestly in business dealings, and building trust. To assist in the application of the organization’s ethical approach to doing business in a different culture, it needs to develop a set of “core values as the basis for global policies and decision-making.”<a href="#auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm247643632" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a> Gerasimova notes that organizations also need to consider that “clients and coworkers may have a different perspective on ethics and proper behavior than those to which you are accustomed.” To address the different perspectives, an organization should train its employees to be culturally sensitive while balancing the need for rules and policies with the ability for employees to be flexible and to use their imagination.</p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm235280592">Kate Gerasimova. “The Critical Role of Ethics and Culture in Business Globalization.” <em data-effect="italics">Business to Community</em>.

Although the causes and cures of climate change are open to discussion, most will agree that everyone, including corporations, should do their part to avoid further damage and improve any negative impact on the environment.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm218445440">As <strong class="colored-text">New Belgium Brewing Company</strong> states on their website: “We’re New Belgium and we pollute. There. We said it. We are not perfect and we know it.” But New Belgium Brewing has become a leader in sustainability. They preach it in every aspect of the company: production, marketing, employees, and customers. The company makes the point that being energy efficient is not only being environmentally responsible, it is being financially responsible through their “internal energy efficiency tax.” The company uses many different metrics to track and improve its impact on the environment. For example, the company measures its energy usage and taxes itself on energy consumption and then saves those internal tax dollars to implement further energy savings by installing new processes and techniques. They divert 99.9 percent of the waste from their brewery away from landfills. The company makes enough in recycling revenues to pay four salaries. These are just a few ways in which New Belgium Brewing faces the challenges of social responsibility. Read more at http://www.newbelgium.com/Sustainability/Environmental-Metrics.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm240701296">In late 2016, the Paris Agreement (Paris Accord) brought together nations for the common cause of combatting climate change. There were 197 nations in attendance, and until recently, all 197 ratified or agreed to the effort. It requires all partners to pursue specific endeavors to keep the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above that of preindustrial levels. This would be accomplished by voluntarily reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In early 2017, US President Donald Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the agreement. At that time, only Syria and Nicaragua were holdouts. Since then, both have signed the agreement, leaving the United States now as the lone holdout, although it will take several years for the formal withdrawal. In spite of the president’s announcement, there have been representatives from cities, states, corporations, and universities around the United States that have pledged to continue with the agreement and meet the greenhouse gas emission targets as set out in the Paris Accord. Many of the corporations who have promised to move forward with reducing greenhouse gases have expressed that the Paris Accord expands markets for groundbreaking clean technologies and that it creates employment opportunities alongside economic growth.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm236755984">In terms of managerial accounting, sustainable business practices create many issues. Organizations need to decide what elements will be measured. For example, minimizing electricity consumption, maximizing employee safety, or reducing greenhouse gases may be the biggest issue of concern for a company. Then, the company needs to determine ways of measurement that make sense regarding those items. Companies are becoming more aware of their impact on the world, and many are creating social responsibility reports in addition to their annual reports. This type of reporting requires different types of information and analysis than the typical financial measures gathered by companies. This is sometimes referred to as the <em data-effect="italics">triple bottom line</em>, as it assesses an organization’s performance not only relating to the profit, but also relating to the world and its people, and will be covered in <a href="#page_8292e223-4463-4e99-944c-87d1f80b7708">Sustainability Reporting</a>.</p>

<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm190469040">Zaley is an aerospace manufacturing firm in the southwest United States. They manufacture several products used in the aviation and aerospace industry. The company has been steadily growing over the past ten years in both sales and personnel. The engineering and design team uses computerized aided drafting (CAD) to design the various products that are produced by the machining division.</p>
<p id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm190468256">The machining division recently implemented significant technological improvements by installing an advanced technique using hard-metal and aluminum high-speed machining. The following managers are involved with the machining division:</p>
<ul id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm190467872" data-bullet-style="bullet">

<ul id="auto_bcc6df8d-269f-4bd5-87bc-f16d26abccfb_fs-idm240462960" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>Alex Freeman, technical specialist (supervises all computer programs), needs information on the hours and type of usage possibly by department or by individual to ascertain if the equipment is being used effectively or if the programs used by the company are appropriate or additions or deletions need to be made. In addition, this information is needed to address how much and what type of staffing he needs in his department.</li>
<li>Emma Vlovski, sales manager (supervises all sales agents), would want information about the level and type of sales for the company as a whole as well as for the individual sales agents. She would want to know which products are selling well, which ones are not, which sales agents are being the most successful, and why they are more successful than the others. Emma would also want information on how the agents are compensated, as this may be tied to the sales agent’s efforts to meet sales goals.</li>
<li>Kayla McClaughley, cost accounting director (supervises all cost accountants), would want to know what tasks the cost accountants perform, how much time they spend on these tasks, and whether there are any redundancies in workload so that improvements in efficiency can be made. If any of the accountants has certifications such as CPA or CMA, she would want to know if they are keeping their certifications current through continuing professional education.</li>
<li>Mwangi Kori, lead test engineer (oversees all new-product testing and design), would need information on the efficiency and effectiveness of each of the products tested, including success and failure rates. She would want information on how well the policies and procedures for design changes are being followed and if those policies and procedures need updating or rewriting.</li>
<li>Thomas Sanchez, production director (supervises all manufacturing employees), would want information on hours worked, pay rates, and training (past and ongoing) for the manufacturing employees. She would also want information on how each individual employee performs his or her role in the manufacturing environment. For example, are there particular employees who have fewer defects or down time in their part of the process than others?</li>

<li>Business regulations are always being altered, global competition continues to increase, and technology provides continual disruption. Management accounting must keep up with the changes in the business environment.</li>
<li>The fundamental difference between manufacturing organizations and service-based firms is whether the organizations produce a tangible product.</li>
<li>Business entities have been in the lead for using technology, but they must continue to adjust quickly with the ever-advancing business technology.</li>
<li>ERP systems help companies streamline their operations and help management respond quickly to change.</li>
<li>Lean manufacturing, which was started in Japan by automakers, is now a widely used practice that attempts to increase productivity and eliminate waste.</li>
<li>The philosophy of continuous improvement has led organizations to adopt practices such as TQM, JIT manufacturing, and LSS.</li>
<li>The balanced scorecard approach uses both financial and nonfinancial measures in evaluating all attributes of the organization’s procedures.</li>
<li>Globalization has expanded competitive borders, giving customers and companies more alternatives.</li>
<li>Many companies have started to assess their corporation not only on financial profits, but also on their corporate social responsibility.</li>

<p id="auto_81f28c76-8e8f-4e94-8597-c2db9394bc11_fs-idm220379392">Many 16-year-olds in the United States eagerly anticipate having a car of their own and the freedom that comes from having their own means of transportation. For many, this means not having to bum a ride from a friend, take a bus, hire <strong class="colored-text">Uber</strong> or <strong class="colored-text">Lyft</strong>, or worse, borrow the parents’ car. However, as appealing as having one’s own set of wheels sounds, it comes with an array of costs that many young drivers do not anticipate. Some of the costs associated with buying and owning a car are fixed, and some vary with the level of activity. For example, a driver pays car payments and insurance premiums every month whether or not the car is driven, but the cost of maintenance and gas can be controlled by driving less. A driver cannot control the price of gasoline or the mechanic’s hourly wage but can control how much of each is used each month.</p>

<p id="auto_81f28c76-8e8f-4e94-8597-c2db9394bc11_fs-idm214816096">Just as car owners incur a variety of costs—fixed, variable, controllable, and uncontrollable—businesses incur these types of costs as well. The goal of managerial accountants is to use this cost information to assist management in both long- and short-term decision-making. Managerial accounting follows standards and best practices for reporting cost data that are less formal than those used for financial accounting. This means management often has the discretion to determine how costs are used internally.</p>

<p id="auto_81f28c76-8e8f-4e94-8597-c2db9394bc11_fs-idm212776384">Since businesses collect and analyze cost data for internal use, there may be distinct differences among businesses in how they estimate and treat certain costs. What does not change, regardless of how cost data is used, are generally agreed upon cost classifications managers use for decision-making. In short, most businesses incur the same <em data-effect="italics">type</em> of costs, but how each firm classifies and manages these costs can vary widely.</p>

   <div data-type="document-title" id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_0">Distinguish between Merchandising, Manufacturing, and Service Organizations</div>

<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm217886464">Most businesses can be classified into one or more of these three categories: <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">manufacturing</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">merchandising</span>, or <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">service</span>. Stated in broad terms, manufacturing firms typically produce a product that is then sold to a merchandising entity (a retailer) For example, <strong class="colored-text">Proctor and Gamble</strong> produces a variety of shampoos that it sells to retailers, such as <strong class="colored-text">Walmart</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">Target</strong>, or <strong class="colored-text">Walgreens</strong>. A service entity provides a service such as accounting or legal services or cable television and internet connections.</p>

<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm217496928">Some companies combine aspects of two or all three of these categories within a single business. If it chooses, the same company can both produce and market its products directly to consumers. For example, <strong class="colored-text">Nike</strong> produces products that it directly sells to consumers and products that it sells to retailers. An example of a company that fits all three categories is Apple, which produces phones, sells them directly to consumers, and also provides services, such as extended warranties.</p>

<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm212757648">Regardless of whether a business is a manufacturer of products, a retailer selling to the customer, a service provider, or some combination , all businesses set goals and have strategic plans that guide their operations. Strategic plans look very different from one company to another. For example, a retailer such as Walmart may have a strategic plan that focuses on increasing same store sales. <strong class="colored-text">Facebook’s</strong> strategic plan may focus on increasing subscribers and attracting new advertisers. An accounting firm may have long-term goals to open offices in neighboring cities in order to serve more clients. Although the goals differ, the process all companies use to achieve their goals is the same. First, they must develop a plan for how they will achieve the goal, and then management will gather, analyze, and use information regarding costs to make decisions, implement plans, and achieve goals.</p>

<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm211203216">A merchandising firm is one of the most common types of businesses. A <span data-type="term">merchandising firm</span> is a business that purchases finished products and resells them to consumers. Consider your local grocery store or retail clothing store. Both of these are merchandising firms. Often, merchandising firms are referred to as <em data-effect="italics">resellers</em> or <em data-effect="italics">retailers</em> since they are in the business of reselling a product to the consumer at a profit.</p>
<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm212584496">Think about purchasing toothpaste from your local drug store. The drug store purchases tens of thousands of tubes of toothpaste from a wholesale distributor or manufacturer in order to get a better per-tube cost. Then, they add their mark-up (or profit margin) to the toothpaste and offer it for sale to you. The drug store did not manufacture the toothpaste; instead, they are reselling a toothpaste that they purchased. Virtually all of your daily purchases are made from merchandising firms such as <strong class="colored-text">Walmart</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">Target</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">Macy’s</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">Walgreens</strong>, and <strong class="colored-text">AutoZone</strong>.</p>
<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm215603568">Merchandising firms account for their costs in a different way from other types of business organizations.

<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm217502448">This simplified income statement demonstrates how merchandising firms account for their sales cycle or process. <em data-effect="italics">Sales revenue</em> is the income generated from the sale of finished goods to consumers rather than from the manufacture of goods or provision of services. Since a merchandising firm has to purchase goods for resale, they account for this cost as <em data-effect="italics">cost of goods sold</em>—what it cost them to acquire the goods that are then sold to the customer. The difference between what the drug store paid for the toothpaste and the revenue generated by selling the toothpaste to consumers is their <em data-effect="italics">gross profit</em>. However, in order to generate sales revenue, merchandising firms incur expenses related to the process of operating their business and selling the merchandise. These costs are called <em data-effect="italics">operating expenses</em>, and the business must deduct them from the gross profit to determine the <em data-effect="italics">operating profit</em>. (Note that while the terms “operating profit” and “operating income” are often used interchangeably, in real-world interactions you should confirm exactly what the user means in using those terms.) Operating expenses incurred by a merchandising firm include insurance, marketing, administrative salaries, and rent.</p>

<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm227469872">Before examining the income statement, let’s look at Cost of Goods Sold in more detail. Merchandising companies have to account for inventory, a topic covered in <a href="/contents/m67888">Inventory</a>. As you recall, merchandising companies carry inventory from one period to another. When they prepare their income statement, a crucial step is identifying the actual cost of goods that were sold for the period.

The company’s inventory includes clothing, footwear for hiking and running, camping gear, backpacks, and accessories, by brands such as The North Face, Birkenstock, Wolverine, Yeti, Altra, Mizuno, and Patagonia. Ted fell in love with the outdoor lifestyle while working as a ski instructor in Colorado and wanted to bring that feeling back home to Arkansas. And so, Gearhead was born in a small downtown location in Jonesboro. The company has had great success over the years, expanding to numerous locations in Ted’s home state, as well as Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Missouri.</p>
<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm225497296">While Ted knew his industry when starting Gearhead, like many entrepreneurs he faced regulatory and financial issues which were new to him. Several of these issues were related to accounting and the wealth of decision-making information which accounting systems provide.</p>

<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm221844384">A <span data-type="term">manufacturing organization</span> is a business that uses parts, components, or raw materials to produce finished goods (<a href="#auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_OSX_Acct_M02_01_Factory" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). These finished goods are sold either directly to the consumer or to other manufacturing firms that use them as a component part to produce a finished product. For example, <strong class="colored-text">Diehard</strong> manufactures automobile batteries that are sold directly to consumers by retail outlets such as AutoZone, <strong class="colored-text">Costco</strong>, and <strong class="colored-text">Advance Auto</strong>. However, these batteries are also sold to automobile manufacturers such as <strong class="colored-text">Ford</strong>, <strong class="colored-text">Chevrolet</strong>, or <strong class="colored-text">Toyota</strong> to be installed in cars during the manufacturing process. Regardless of who the final consumer of the final product is, Diehard must control its costs so that the sale of batteries generates revenue sufficient to keep the organization profitable.</p>

<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm213079488">Manufacturing firms are more complex organizations than merchandising firms and therefore have a larger variety of costs to control. For example, a merchandising firm may purchase furniture to sell to consumers, whereas a manufacturing firm must acquire raw materials such as lumber, paint, hardware, glue, and varnish that they transform into furniture. The manufacturer incurs additional costs, such as direct labor, to convert the raw materials into furniture. Operating a physical plant where the production process takes place also generates costs. Some of these costs are tied directly to production, while others are general expenses necessary to operate the business. Because the manufacturing process can be highly complex, manufacturing firms constantly evaluate their production processes to determine where cost savings are possible.</p>

However, as you will learn, there is a significant difference in the calculation of cost of goods sold. <a href="#auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_OSX_Acct_M02_01_Inc02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows a simplification of the income statement for a manufacturing firm:</p>

<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm227040192">At first it appears that there is no difference between the income statements of the merchandising firm and the manufacturing firm. However, the difference is in how these two types of firms account for the cost of goods sold. Merchandising firms determine their cost of goods sold by accounting for both existing inventory and new purchases, as shown in the Plum Crazy example. It is typically easy for merchandising firms to calculate their costs because they know exactly what they paid for their merchandise.</p>
<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm213133072">Unlike merchandising firms, manufacturing firms must calculate their cost of goods sold based on how much they manufacture and how much it costs them to manufacture those goods. This requires manufacturing firms to prepare an additional statement before they can prepare their income statement. This additional statement is the <em data-effect="italics">Cost of Goods Manufactured</em> statement. Once the cost of goods manufactured is calculated, the cost is then incorporated into the manufacturing firm’s income statement to calculate its cost of goods sold.</p>
<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm213473696">One thing manufacturing firms must consider in their cost of goods manufactured is that, at any given time, they have products at varying levels of production: some are finished and others are still process. The cost of goods manufactured statement measures the cost of the goods actually finished during the period, whether or not they were started during that period.</p>
<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm213307440">Before examining the typical manufacturing firm’s process to track cost of goods manufactured, you need basic definitions of three terms in the schedule of Costs of Goods Manufactured: direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. <span data-type="term">Direct materials</span> are the components used in the production process whose costs can be identified on a per item-produced basis. For example, if you are producing cars, the engine would be a direct material item. The direct material cost would be the cost of one engine. <span data-type="term">Direct labor</span> represents production labor costs that can be identified on a per item-produced basis. Referring to the car production example, assume that the engines are placed in the car by individuals rather than by an automated process. The direct labor cost would be the amount of labor in hours multiplied by the hourly labor cost. <span data-type="term">Manufacturing overhead</span> generally includes those costs incurred in the production process that are not economically feasible to measure as direct material or direct labor costs. Examples include the department manager’s salary, the production factory’s utilities, or glue used to attach rubber molding in the auto production process. Since there are so many possible costs that can be classified as manufacturing overhead, they tend to be grouped and then allocated in a predetermined manner to the production process.</p>
<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm216084880"><a href="#auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_OSX_Acct_M02_01_COGM" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> is an example of the calculation of the Cost of Goods Manufactured for Koeller Manufacturing. It demonstrates the relationship between cost of goods manufactured and cost of goods in progress and includes the three main types of manufacturing costs.</p>

<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm217089568">As you can see, the manufacturing firm takes into account its work-in-process (WIP) inventory as well as the costs incurred during the current period to finish not only the units that were in the beginning WIP inventory, but also a portion of any production that was started but not finished during the month. Notice that the current manufacturing costs, or the additional costs incurred during the month, include direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.

<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm215918832">A <span data-type="term">service organization</span> is a business that earns revenue by providing <span data-type="term">intangible products</span>, those that have no physical substance. The service industry is a vital sector of the U.S. economy, providing 65% of the U.S. private-sector gross domestic product and more than 79% of U.S. private-sector jobs.<a href="#auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm213613200" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a> If <span data-type="term">tangible products</span>, physical goods that customers can handle and see, are provided by a service organization, they are considered ancillary sources of revenue. Large service organizations such as airlines, insurance companies, and hospitals incur a variety of costs in the provision of their services. Costs such as labor, supplies, equipment, advertising, and facility maintenance can quickly spiral out of control if management is not careful. Therefore, although their cost drivers are sometimes not as complex as those of other types of firms, cost identification and control are every bit as important in the service industry.</p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm213613200">John Ward. “The Services Sector: How Best to Measure It?” International Trade Administration.

<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm211708432">For example, consider the services that a law firm provides its clients. What clients pay for are services such as representation in legal proceedings, contract negotiations, and preparation of wills. Although the true value of these services is not contained in their physical form, they are of value to the client and the source of revenue to the firm. The managing partners in the firm must be as cost conscious as their counterparts in merchandising and manufacturing firms. Accounting for costs in service firms differs from merchandising and manufacturing firms in that they do not purchase or produce goods. For example, consider a medical practice. Although some services provided are tangible products, such as medications or medical devices, the primary benefits the physicians provide their patients are the intangible services that are comprised of his or her knowledge, experience, and expertise.</p>
<p id="auto_50047b77-2614-4403-84d9-e918fac6f026_fs-idm223295488">Service providers have some costs (or revenue) derived from tangible goods that must be taken into account when pricing their services, but their largest cost categories are more likely to be administrative and personnel costs rather than product costs.</p>

With two senior partners and a small staff of accountants and payroll specialists, the majority of the costs they incur are related to personnel. The value of the accounting and payroll services they provide to their clients is intangible in comparison to goods sold by a merchandiser or produced by a manufacturer but has value and is the primary source of revenue for the firm.

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm182470256">Now that we have identified the three key types of businesses, let’s identify <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">cost behaviors</span> and apply them to the business environment. In managerial accounting, different companies use the term <em data-effect="italics">cost</em> in different ways depending on how they will use the cost information. Different decisions require different costs classified in different ways. For instance, a manager may need cost information to plan for the coming year or to make decisions about expanding or discontinuing a product or service. In practice, the classification of costs changes as the use of the cost data changes. In fact, a single cost, such as rent, may be classified by one company as a fixed cost, by another company as a committed cost, and by even another company as a period cost. Understanding different cost classifications and how certain costs can be used in different ways is critical to managerial accounting.</p>

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm205829088">Managerial accountants provide businesses with clear and direct insight into the monetary effects of any particular operational action under consideration. They are expected to report financial information in a transparent and ethical fashion. The Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) offers the Certified Management Accountant (CMA) certification. IMA members and CMAs agree to uphold a set of ethical principles that includes honesty, fairness, objectivity, and responsibility. Any managerial accountant, even if not an IMA member or certified CMA, should act in accordance with these principles and encourage coworkers to follow ethical principles for reporting financial results and monetary effects of financial decisions related to their organization. The IMA Committee on Ethics encourages organizations and individuals to adopt, promote, and execute business practices consistent with high ethical standards.<a href="#auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm207919888" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm207919888">“Ethics Center.” Institute of Management Accountants. https://www.imanet.org/career-resources/ethics-center?ssopc=1</aside>

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm214995984">Any discussion of costs begins with the understanding that most costs will be classified in one of three ways: fixed costs, variable costs, or mixed costs. The costs that don’t fall into one of these three categories are hybrid costs, which are examined only briefly because they are addressed in more advanced accounting courses. Because fixed and variable costs are the foundation of all other cost classifications, understanding whether a cost is a fixed cost or a variable cost is very important.</p>

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm203291200">We have established that fixed costs do not change in total as the level of activity changes, but what about fixed costs on a <em data-effect="italics">per-unit</em> basis? Let’s examine Tony’s screen-printing company to illustrate how costs can remain fixed in total but change on a per-unit basis.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm208407472">Tony operates a screen-printing company, specializing in custom T-shirts. One of his fixed costs is his monthly rent of $1,000. Regardless of whether he produces and sells any T-shirts, he is obligated under his lease to pay $1,000 per month. However, he can consider this fixed cost on a per-unit basis, as shown in <a href="#auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_OSX_Acct_M02_02_Tony01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm216509616">Tony’s information illustrates that, despite the unchanging fixed cost of rent, as the level of activity increases, the per-unit fixed cost falls. In other words, fixed costs remain fixed in total but can increase or decrease on a per-unit basis.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm196389584">Two specialized types of fixed costs are committed fixed costs and discretionary fixed costs. These classifications are generally used for long-range planning purposes and are covered in upper-level managerial accounting courses, so they are only briefly described here.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm200371264">Committed fixed costs are fixed costs that typically cannot be eliminated if the company is going to continue to function. An example would be the lease of factory equipment for a production company.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm205876192">Discretionary fixed costs generally are fixed costs that can be incurred during some periods and postponed during other periods but which cannot normally be eliminated permanently. Examples could include advertising campaigns and employee training. Both of these costs could potentially be postponed temporarily, but the company would probably incur negative effects if the costs were permanently eliminated. These classifications are generally used for long-range planning purposes.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm213997680">In addition to understanding fixed costs, it is critical to understand variable costs, the second fundamental cost classification. A <span data-type="term">variable cost</span> is one that varies in direct proportion to the level of activity within the business. Typical costs that are classified as variable costs are the cost of raw materials used to produce a product, labor applied directly to the production of the product, and overhead expenses that change based upon activity. For each variable cost, there is some activity that drives the variable cost up or down. A <span data-type="term">cost driver</span> is defined as any activity that causes the organization to incur a variable cost. Examples of cost drivers are direct labor hours, machine hours, units produced, and units sold. <a href="#auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm214993264" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> provides examples of variable costs and their associated cost drivers.</p>

The Boeing Company generates around $90 billion each year from selling thousands of airplanes to commercial and military customers around the world. It employs around 200,000 people, and it’s indirectly responsible for more than a million jobs through its suppliers, contractors, regulators, and others. Its main assembly line in Everett, WA, is housed in the largest building in the world, a colossal facility that covers nearly a half-trillion cubic feet. Boeing is, simply put, a massive enterprise.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm194438288">And yet, Boeing’s managers know the exact cost of everything the company uses to produce its airplanes: every propeller, flap, seat belt, welder, computer programmer, and so forth. Moreover, they know how those costs would change if they produced more airplanes or fewer. They also know the price at which they sold each plane and the profit the company made on each sale. Boeing’s executives expect their managers to know this information, in real time, if the company is to remain profitable.</p>

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm209465936">Because average variable costs are the average of all costs that change with production levels on a per-unit basis and include both direct materials and direct labor, managers often use AVC to determine if production should continue or not in the short run. As long as the price Carolina Yachts receives for their boats is greater than the per-unit AVC, they know that they are not only covering the variable cost of production, but each boat is making a contribution toward covering fixed costs. If, at any point, the average variable cost per boat rises to the point that the price no longer covers the AVC, Carolina Yachts may consider halting production until the variable costs fall again.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm196360544">These changes in variable costs per unit could be caused by circumstances beyond their control, such as a shortage of raw materials or an increase in shipping costs due to high gas prices.

Ocean Breeze pays $2,000 per month, regardless of the number of rooms rented. Even if it does not rent a single room during the month, Ocean Breeze still must remit this tax to the county. The hotel treats this $2,000 as a fixed cost. However, for every night that a room is rented, Ocean Breeze must remit an additional tax amount of $5.00 per room per night.

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm205404416">The graph shows that mixed costs are typically both fixed and linear in nature. In other words, they will often have an initial cost, in Ocean Breeze’s case, the $2,000 fixed component of the occupancy tax, and a variable component, the $5 per night occupancy tax. Note that the Ocean Breeze mixed cost graph starts at an initial $2,000 for the fixed component and then increases by $5 for each night their rooms are occupied.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm200037296">Some costs behave less linearly. A cost that changes with the level of activity but is not linear is classified as a <span data-type="term">stepped cost</span>. Step costs remain constant at a fixed amount over a range of activity. The range over which these costs remain unchanged (fixed) is referred to as the <span data-type="term">relevant range</span>, which is defined as a specific activity level that is bounded by a minimum and maximum amount. Within this relevant range, managers can predict revenue or cost levels. Then, at certain points, the step costs increase to a higher amount. Both fixed and variable costs can take on this stair-step behavior. For instance, wages often act as a stepped variable cost when employees are paid a flat salary and a commission or when the company pays overtime. Further, when additional machinery or equipment is placed into service, businesses will see their fixed costs stepped up. The “trigger” for a cost to step up is the relevant range. Graphically, step costs appear like stair steps (<a href="#auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_OSX_Acct_M02_02_Stepped" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm207220416">For example, suppose a quality inspector can inspect a maximum of 80 units in a regular 8-hour shift and his salary is a fixed cost. Then the relevant range for QA inspection is from 0–80 units per shift. If demand for these units increases and more than 80 inspections are needed per shift, the relevant range has been exceeded and the business will have one of two choices:</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm214535840">(1) Pay the quality inspector overtime in order to have the additional units inspected. This overtime will “step up” the variable cost per unit. The advantage to handling the increased cost in this way is that when demand falls, the cost can quickly be “stepped down” again. Because these types of step costs can be adjusted quickly and often, they are often still treated as variable costs for planning purposes.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm215002416">(2) “Step up” fixed costs. If the company hires a second quality inspector, they would be stepping up their fixed costs. In effect, they will double the relevant range to allow for a maximum of 160 inspections per shift, assuming the second QA inspector can inspect an additional 80 units per shift. The down side to this approach is that once the new QA inspector is hired, if demand falls again, the company will be incurring fixed costs that are unnecessary. For this reason, adding salaried personnel to address a short-term increase in demand is not a decision most businesses make.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm218294224">Step costs are best explained in the context of a business experiencing increases in activity beyond the relevant range. As an example, let’s return to Tony’s T-Shirts.</p>

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm195379008">As you can see, Tony has both fixed and variable costs associated with his business. His one screen-printing machine can only produce 2,000 T-shirts per month and his current employee can produce 20 shirts per hour (160 per 8-hour work day). The space that Tony leases is large enough that he could add an additional screen-printing machine and 1 additional employee. If he expands beyond that, he will need to lease a larger space, and presumably his rent would increase at that point. It is easy for Tony to predict his costs as long as he operates within the relevant ranges by applying the total cost equation <em data-effect="italics">Y</em> = <em data-effect="italics">a</em> + <em data-effect="italics">bx</em>. So, for Tony, as long as he produces 2,000 or fewer T-shirts, his total cost will be found by <em data-effect="italics">Y</em> = $6,000 + $0.75<em data-effect="italics">x</em>, where the variable cost of $0.75 is the $0.25 cost of the ink per shirt and $0.50 per shirt for labor ($10 per hour wage/20 shirts per hour). As soon as his production passes the 2,000 T-shirts that his one employee and one machine can handle, he will have to add a second employee and lease a second screen-printing machine. In other words, his fixed costs will rise from $6,000 to $8,000, while his variable costs will increase in total because he has two workers now, his variable cost per T-shirt will stay the same (ink plus hourly rate to make one shirt). Thus, his new cost equation is <em data-effect="italics">Y</em> = $8,000 + $0.75<em data-effect="italics">x</em> until he “steps up” again and adds a third machine <em data-effect="italics">and</em> moves to a new location with a presumably higher rent. Let’s take a look at this in chart form to better illustrate the “step” in cost Tony will experience as he steps past 2,000 T-shirts.</p><p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm195109488">Tony’s cost information is shown in the chart for volume between 500 and 4,000 shirts.</p>

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm199676176">Many businesses can make decisions by dividing their costs into fixed and variable costs, but there are some business decisions that require grouping costs differently. Sometimes companies need to consider how those costs are reported in the financial statements. At other times, companies group costs based on functions within the business. For example, a business would group administrative and selling expenses by the period (monthly or quarterly) so that they can be reported on an Income Statement. However, a manufacturing firm may carry product costs such as materials from one period to the other in order to have the costs “travel” with the units being produced. It is possible that both the selling and administrative costs and materials costs have both fixed and variable components. As a result, it may be necessary to analyze some fixed costs together with some variable costs. Ultimately, businesses strategically group costs in order to make them more useful for decision-making and planning. Two of the broadest and most common grouping of costs are product costs and period costs.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm207520816"><span data-type="term">Product costs</span> are all those associated with the acquisition or production of goods and products. When products are purchased for resale, the cost of goods is recorded as an asset on the company’s balance sheet. It is not until the products are sold that they become an expense on the income statement. By moving product costs to the expense account for the cost of goods sold, they are easily matched to the sales revenue income account. For example, Bert’s Bikes is a bicycle retailer who purchases bikes from several wholesale distributors and manufacturers. When Bert purchases bicycles for resale, he places the cost of the bikes into his inventory account, because that is what those bikes are—his inventory available for sale. It is not until someone purchases a bike that it creates sales revenue, and in order to fulfill the requirements of double-entry accounting, he must match that income with an expense: the cost of goods sold (<a href="#auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_OSX_Acct_M02_02_ProdJrnl" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm213591504">Some product costs have both a fixed and variable component. For example, Bert purchases 10 bikes for $100 each. The distributor charges $10 per bike for shipping for 1 to 10 bikes but $8 per bike for 11 to 20 bikes. This shipping cost is fixed per unit but varies in total. If Bert wants to save money and control his cost of goods sold, he can order an 11th bike and drop his shipping cost by $2 per bike. It is important for Bert to know what is fixed and what is variable so that he can control his costs as much as possible.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm182335792">What about the costs Bert incurs that are not product costs? <span data-type="term">Period costs</span> are simply all of the expenses that are not product costs, such as all selling and administrative expenses. It is important to remember that period costs are treated as expenses in the period in which they occur. In other words, they follow the rules of accrual accounting practice by recognizing the cost (expense) in the period in which they occur regardless of when the cash changes hands. For example, Bert pays his business insurance in January of each year. Bert’s annual insurance premium is $10,800, which is $900 per month. Each month, Bert will recognize 1/12 of this insurance cost as an expense in the period in which it is incurred (<a href="#auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_OSX_Acct_M02_02_PeriodJrnl" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm204607632">Why is it so important for Bert to know which costs are product costs and which are period costs? Bert may have little control over his product costs, but he maintains a great deal of control over many of his period costs. For this reason, it is important that Bert be able to identify his period costs and then determine which of them are fixed and which are variable. Remember that fixed costs are fixed over the relevant range, but variable costs change with the level of activity. If Bert wants to control his costs to make his bike business more profitable, he must be able to differentiate between the costs he can and cannot control.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm213454112">Just like a merchandising business such as Bert’s Bikes, manufacturers also classify their costs as either product costs or period costs. For a manufacturing business, product costs are the costs associated with making the product, and period costs are all other costs. For the purposes of external reporting, separating costs into period and product costs is not all that is necessary. However, for management decision-making activities, refinement of the types of product costs is helpful.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm199776560">In a manufacturing firm, the need for management to be aware of the types of costs that make up the cost of a product is of paramount importance. Let’s look at Carolina Yachts again and examine how they can classify the product costs associated with building their sportfishing boats. Just like automobiles, every year, Carolina Yachts makes changes to their boats, introducing new models to their product line. When the engineers begin to redesign boats for the next year, they must be careful not to make changes that would drive the selling price of their boats too high, making them less attractive to the customer. The engineers need to know exactly what the addition of another feature will do to the cost of production. It is not enough for them to get total product cost data; instead, they need specific information about the three classes of product costs: materials, labor, and overhead.</p>

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm206223600">In each of the examples, managers are able to trace the cost of the materials directly to a specific unit (cake, car, or chair) produced. Since the amount of direct materials required will change based on the number of units produced, direct materials are almost always classified as a variable cost. They remain fixed per unit of production but change in total based on the level of activity within the business.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm195475248">It takes more than materials for Carolina Yachts to build a boat. It requires the application of labor to the raw materials and component parts. You’ve also learned that direct labor is the work of the employees who are directly involved in the production of goods or services. In fact, for many industries, the largest cost incurred in the production process is labor. For Carolina Yachts, their direct labor would include the wages paid to the carpenters, painters, electricians, and welders who build the boats. Like direct materials, direct labor is typically treated as a variable cost because it varies with the level of activity. However, there are some companies that pay a flat weekly or monthly salary for production workers, and for these employees, their compensation could be classified as a fixed cost. For example, many auto mechanics are now paid a flat weekly or monthly salary.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm195515344">While in the example Carolina Yachts is dependent upon direct labor, the production process for companies in many industries is moving from human labor to a more automated production process. For these companies, direct labor in these industries is becoming less significant. For an example, you can research the current production process for the automobile industry.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm195472496">The third major classification of product costs for a manufacturing business is overhead. Manufacturing overhead (sometimes referred to as <em data-effect="italics">factory overhead</em>) includes all of the costs that a manufacturing business incurs, other than the variable costs of direct materials and direct labor required to build products. These overhead costs are not directly attributable to a specific unit of production, but they are incurred to support the production of goods. Some of the items included in manufacturing overhead include supervisor salaries, depreciation on the factory, maintenance, insurance, and utilities. It is important to note that manufacturing overhead does not include any of the selling or administrative functions of a business. For Carolina Yachts, costs like the sales, marketing, CEO, and clerical staff salaries will not be included in the calculation of manufacturing overhead costs but will instead be allocated to selling and administrative expenses.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm195470608">As you have learned, much of the power of managerial accounting is its ability to break costs down into the smallest possible trackable unit. This also applies to manufacturing overhead. In many cases, businesses have a need to further refine their overhead costs and will track indirect labor and indirect materials.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm195469888">When labor costs are incurred but are not directly involved in the active conversion of materials into finished products, they are classified as <span data-type="term">indirect labor</span> costs. For example, Carolina Yachts has production supervisors who oversee the manufacturing process but do not actively participate in the construction of the boats. Their wages generally support the production process but cannot be traced back to a single unit. For this reason, the production supervisors’ salary would be classified as indirect labor. Similar to direct labor, on a product or department basis, indirect labor, such as the supervisor’s salary, is often treated as a fixed cost, assuming that it does not vary with the level of activity or number of units produced. However, if you are considering the supervisor’s salary cost on a per unit of production basis, then it could be considered a variable cost.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm212316784">Similarly, not all materials used in the production process can be traced back to a specific unit of production. When this is the case, they are classified as <span data-type="term">indirect material</span> costs. Although needed to produce the product, these indirect material costs are not traceable to a <em data-effect="italics">specific</em> unit of production. For Carolina Yachts, their indirect materials include supplies like tools, glue, wax, and cleaning supplies. These materials are required to build a boat, but management cannot easily track how much of a bottle of glue they use or how often they use a particular drill to build a specific boat. These indirect materials and their associated cost represent a small fraction of the total materials needed to complete a unit of production. Like direct materials, indirect materials are classified as a variable cost since they vary with the level of production. <a href="#auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm204190240" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> provides some examples of manufacturing costs and their classifications.</p>

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm211793296">In certain production environments, once a business has separated the costs of the product into direct materials, direct labor, and overhead, the costs can then be gathered into two broader categories: prime costs and conversion costs. <span data-type="term">Prime costs</span> are the direct material expenses and direct labor costs, while <span data-type="term">conversion costs</span> are direct labor and general factory overhead combined. Please note that these two categories of costs are examples of cost categories where a particular cost can be included in both. In this case, direct labor is included in both prime costs and conversion costs.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm207176928">These cost classifications are common in businesses that produce large quantities of an item that is then packaged into smaller, sellable quantities such as soft drinks or cereal. In these types of production environments, it easier to lump the costs of direct labor and overhead into one category, since these costs are what are needed to convert raw materials into a finished product. This method of costing is termed <em data-effect="italics">process costing</em> and is covered in <a href="#page_7a51fb77-1243-4806-b8ba-1bb2c90475a7">Process Costing</a>.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm214473520">Although it seems as if there are many classifications or labels associated with costs, remember that the purpose of cost classification is to assist managers in the decision-making process. Since this type of data is not used for external reporting purposes, it is important to understand that (1) a single cost can have many different labels; (2) the terms are used independently, not simultaneously; and (3) each classification is important to understand in order to make business decisions. <a href="#auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_OSX_Acct_M02_02_Costs" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> uses some example costs to demonstrate these principles.</p>

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm200813360">We have spent considerable time identifying and describing the various ways that businesses categorize costs. However, categorization itself is not enough. It is important not only to understand the categorization of costs but to understand the relationships between changes in activity levels and the changes in costs in total. It is worth repeating that when a cost is considered to be fixed, that cost is only fixed for the relevant range. Once the boundary of the relevant range has been reached or moved beyond, fixed costs will change and then remain fixed for the new relevant range. Remember that, within a relevant range of activity, where the relevant range refers to a specific activity level that is bounded by a minimum and maximum amount, total fixed costs are constant, but costs change on a per-unit basis. Let’s examine an example that demonstrates how changes in activity can affect costs.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm205310848" class="ethical-considerations"><div data-type="title" id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_18">Cost Accounting Helps Reduce Fraud and Promotes Ethical Behavior</div>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm194372080">Managerial and related cost accounting systems assist managers in making ethical and sound business decisions. Managerial accountants implement accounting reporting systems to minimize or prevent fraud and promote ethical decision-making. For example, tracking changes in costing activity and ensuring that activity remains in a relevant range, helps ensure that an organization’s business activity is properly bounded within a reasonable range of expense. If the minimum or maximum expense range is exceeded, this can indicate that management is acting without authority or is pursuing unauthorized activities. Excessive costs may even be a red flag that possible fraud is occurring. Cost accounting helps ensure that financial costs are within an acceptable range and helps an organization make reliable forward-looking financial decisions.</p>

<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm202529232">He is considering his costs for the trip if he goes alone, or if he takes one, two, three, or four friends. However, before he can begin his analysis, he needs to consider the characteristics of the costs. Some of the costs will stay the same no matter how many people go, and some of the costs will fluctuate, based on the number of participants.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm200810928">Those costs that do not change are the fixed costs. Once you incur a fixed cost, it does not change within a given range. For example, Pat can take up to five people in one car, so the cost of the car is fixed for up to five people. However, if he took more friends, then he would need more cars. The condo rental and the gasoline expenses would also be considered fixed costs, because they are not going to change in the reference range.</p>
<p id="auto_9769b01b-d428-4d6a-bdcc-2cc4fe76e884_fs-idm182628864">The costs that do change as the number of participants change are the variable costs.

She has located a condominium on the beach and has put a deposit down on the unit. The rental company has a maximum occupancy for the condominium of seven adults. There is an amusement park that she plans to visit. She is going to use her parents’ car, an SUV that can carry up to six people and their luggage. The SUV can travel an average of 20 miles per gallon, the total distance is approximately 1,250 miles (550 miles each way plus driving around Tampa every day), and the average price of gas is $3 per gallon.

All responses should recognize that there is no room in the car for the seventh girl and her luggage, although the condominium will accommodate the extra person. This means they will have to either find a larger vehicle and incur higher gas expenses or take a second car, which will at least double the fixed gas cost.</p>

<li>Costs can be broadly classified as either fixed or variable costs. However, in order for managers to manage effectively, these two cost classifications are often further expanded to include mixed, step, prime, and conversion costs.</li>
<li>For manufacturing firms, it is essential that they differentiate among direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead in order to identify and manage their total product costs.</li>
<li>For planning purposes, managers must be careful to consider the relevant range because it is only within this relevant range that total fixed costs remain constant.</li>

<p id="auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_fs-idm194354032">Sometimes, a business will need to use cost estimation techniques, particularly in the case of mixed costs, so that they can separate the fixed and variable components, since only the variable components change in the short run. Estimation is also useful for using current data to predict the effects of future changes in production on total costs. Three estimation techniques that can be used include the scatter graph, the high-low method, and regression analysis. Here we will demonstrate the scatter graph and the high-low methods (you will learn the regression analysis technique in advanced managerial accounting courses.</p>

<p id="auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_fs-idm207335632">One of the assumptions that managers must make in order to use the cost equation is that the relationship between activity and costs is linear. In other words, costs rise in direct proportion to activity. A diagnostic tool that is used to verify this assumption is a scatter graph.</p>
<p id="auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_fs-idm194250416">A <span data-type="term">scatter graph</span> shows plots of points that represent actual costs incurred for various levels of activity. Once the scatter graph is constructed, we draw a line (often referred to as a <em data-effect="italics">trend line</em>) that appears to best fit the pattern of dots. Because the trend line is somewhat subjective, the scatter graph is often used as a preliminary tool to explore the possibility that the relationship between cost and activity is generally a linear relationship. When interpreting a scatter graph, it is important to remember that different people would likely draw different lines, which would lead to different estimations of fixed and variable costs. No one person’s line and cost estimates would necessarily be right or wrong compared to another; they would just be different. After using a scatter graph to determine whether cost and activity have a linear relationship, managers often move on to more precise processes for cost estimation, such as the high-low method or least-squares regression analysis.</p>
<p id="auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_fs-idm197451824">To demonstrate how a company would use a scatter graph, let’s turn to the data for Regent Airlines, which operates a fleet of regional jets serving the northeast United States. The Federal Aviation Administration establishes guidelines for routine aircraft maintenance based upon the number of flight hours. As a result, Regent finds that its maintenance costs vary from month to month with the number of flight hours, as depicted in <a href="#auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_OSX_Acct_M02_03_RAir01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_fs-idm196897408">In scatter graphs, cost is considered the dependent variable because cost <em data-effect="italics">depends</em> upon the level of activity. The activity is considered the independent variable since it is the cause of the variation in costs. Regent’s scatter graph shows a positive relationship between flight hours and maintenance costs because, as flight hours increase, maintenance costs also increase.

<p id="auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_fs-idm212737888">As you can see from the scatter graph, there is really not a linear relationship between how many flight hours are flown and the costs of snow removal. This makes sense as snow removal costs are linked to the amount of snow and the number of flights taking off and landing but not to how many hours the planes fly.</p>
<p id="auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_fs-idm197413856">Using a scatter graph to determine if this linear relationship exists is an essential first step in cost behavior analysis. If the scatter graph reveals a linear cost behavior, then managers can proceed with a more sophisticated analyses to separate mixed costs into their fixed and variable components. However, if this linear relationship is not present, then other methods of analysis are not appropriate. Let’s examine the cost data from Regent Airline using the high-low method.</p>

<p id="auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_fs-idm202518880">As you’ve learned, the purpose of identifying costs is to control them, and managers regularly use past costs to predict future costs. Since we know that variable costs change with the level of activity, we can conclude that there is <em data-effect="italics">usually</em> a positive relationship between cost and activity: As one rises, so does the other. Ideally, this can be confirmed on a scatter graph. One of the simplest ways to analyze costs is to use the <span data-type="term">high-low method</span>, a technique for separating the fixed and variable cost components of mixed costs. Using the highest and lowest levels of activity and their associated costs, we are able to estimate the variable cost components of mixed costs.</p>
<p id="auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_fs-idm195393600">Once we have established that there is linear cost behavior, we can equate variable costs with the slope of the line, expressed as the rise of the line over the run. The steeper the slope of the line, the faster costs rise in response to a change in activity. Recall from the scatter graph that costs are the dependent <em data-effect="italics">Y</em> variable and activity is the independent <em data-effect="italics">X</em> variable. By examining the change in <em data-effect="italics">Y</em> relative to the change in <em data-effect="italics">X</em>, we can predict cost:</p>

When put into practice, the managers at Regent Airlines can now predict their total costs at any level of activity, as shown in <a href="#auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_OSX_Acct_M02_03_RAir05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_fs-idm222192256">Although managers frequently use this method, it is not the most accurate approach to predicting future costs because it is based on only two pieces of cost data: the highest and the lowest levels of activity. Actual costs can vary significantly from these estimates, especially when the high or low activity levels are not representative of the usual level of activity within the business. For a more accurate model, the least-squares regression method would be used to separate mixed costs into their fixed and variable components. The least-squares regression method is a statistical technique that may be used to estimate the total cost at the given level of activity based on past cost data. Least-squares regression minimizes the errors of trying to fit a line between the data points and thus fits the line more closely to all the data points.</p>
<p id="auto_c4501691-5216-4211-bd3f-24dcd02a9fa8_fs-idm221139488">Understanding the various labels used for costs is the first step toward using costs to evaluate business decisions. You will learn more about these various labels and how they are applied in decision-making processes as you continue your study of managerial accounting in this course.</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm206689632">Financial statement analysis reviews financial information found on financial statements to make informed decisions about the business. The income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows, among other financial information, can be analyzed. The information obtained from this analysis can benefit decision-making for internal and external stakeholders and can give a company valuable information on overall performance and specific areas for improvement. The analysis can help them with budgeting, deciding where to cut costs, how to increase revenues, and future capital investments opportunities.</p>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm242822752">When considering the outcomes from analysis, it is important for a company to understand that data produced needs to be compared to others within industry and close competitors. The company should also consider their past experience and how it corresponds to current and future performance expectations. Three common analysis tools are used for decision-making; horizontal analysis, vertical analysis, and financial ratios.</p>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm236920160">For our discussion of financial statement analysis, we will use Banyan Goods.

Let’s begin our analysis discussion by looking at horizontal analysis.</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm208284992">Horizontal analysis (also known as trend analysis) looks at trends over time on various financial statement line items. A company will look at one period (usually a year) and compare it to another period. For example, a company may compare sales from their current year to sales from the prior year. The trending of items on these financial statements can give a company valuable information on overall performance and specific areas for improvement. It is most valuable to do horizontal analysis for information over multiple periods to see how change is occurring for each line item. If multiple periods are not used, it can be difficult to identify a trend. The year being used for comparison purposes is called the base year (usually the prior period). The year of comparison for horizontal analysis is analyzed for dollar and percent changes against the base year.</p>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm233652048">The dollar change is found by taking the dollar amount in the base year and subtracting that from the year of analysis.</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm234100768">Using Banyan Goods as our example, if Banyan wanted to compare net sales in the current year (year of analysis) of $120,000 to the prior year (base year) of $100,000, the dollar change would be as follows:</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm252359952">This means Banyan Goods saw an increase of $20,000 in net sales in the current year as compared to the prior year, which was a 20% increase. The same dollar change and percentage change calculations would be used for the income statement line items as well as the balance sheet line items.

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm210121008">Depending on their expectations, Banyan Goods could make decisions to alter operations to produce expected outcomes. For example, Banyan saw a 50% accounts receivable increase from the prior year to the current year. If they were only expecting a 20% increase, they may need to explore this line item further to determine what caused this difference and how to correct it going forward. It could possibly be that they are extending credit more readily than anticipated or not collecting as rapidly on outstanding accounts receivable. The company will need to further examine this difference before deciding on a course of action. Another method of analysis Banyan might consider before making a decision is vertical analysis.</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm208291552">Vertical analysis shows a comparison of a line item within a statement to another line item within that same statement. For example, a company may compare cash to total assets in the current year. This allows a company to see what percentage of cash (the comparison line item) makes up total assets (the other line item) during the period. This is different from horizontal analysis, which compares across years. Vertical analysis compares line items within a statement in the current year. This can help a business to know how much of one item is contributing to overall operations. For example, a company may want to know how much inventory contributes to total assets. They can then use this information to make business decisions such as preparing the budget, cutting costs, increasing revenues, or capital investments.</p>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm217791792">The company will need to determine which line item they are comparing all items to within that statement and then calculate the percentage makeup. These percentages are considered <em data-effect="italics">common-size</em> because they make businesses within industry comparable by taking out fluctuations for size. It is typical for an income statement to use net sales (or sales) as the comparison line item. This means net sales will be set at 100% and all other line items within the income statement will represent a percentage of net sales.</p>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm200829344">On the balance sheet, a company will typically look at two areas: (1) total assets, and (2) total liabilities and stockholders’ equity. Total assets will be set at 100% and all assets will represent a percentage of total assets. Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity will also be set at 100% and all line items within liabilities and equity will be represented as a percentage of total liabilities and stockholders’ equity. The line item set at 100% is considered the base amount and the comparison line item is considered the comparison amount. The formula to determine the common-size percentage is:</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm212658720">Cash in the current year is $110,000 and total assets equal $250,000, giving a common-size percentage of 44%. If the company had an expected cash balance of 40% of total assets, they would be exceeding expectations. This may not be enough of a difference to make a change, but if they notice this deviates from industry standards, they may need to make adjustments, such as reducing the amount of cash on hand to reinvest in the business. The image below shows the common-size calculations on the comparative income statements and comparative balance sheets for Banyan Goods.</p><figure id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_OSX_Acct_00_AA_FS03"><figcaption>Income Statements and Vertical Analysis.</figcaption>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm241556128">Even though vertical analysis is a statement comparison within the same year, Banyan can use information from the prior year’s vertical analysis to make sure the business is operating as expected. For example, unearned revenues increased from the prior year to the current year and made up a larger portion of total liabilities and stockholders’ equity. This could be due to many factors, and Banyan Goods will need to examine this further to see why this change has occurred. Let’s turn to financial statement analysis using financial ratios.</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm200734672">Financial ratios help both internal and external users of information make informed decisions about a company. A stakeholder could be looking to invest, become a supplier, make a loan, or alter internal operations, among other things, based in part on the outcomes of ratio analysis. The information resulting from ratio analysis can be used to examine trends in performance, establish benchmarks for success, set budget expectations, and compare industry competitors. There are four main categories of ratios: liquidity, solvency, efficiency, and profitability. Note that while there are more ideal outcomes for some ratios, the industry in which the business operates can change the influence each of these outcomes has over stakeholder decisions. (You will learn more about ratios, industry standards, and ratio interpretation in advanced accounting courses.)</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm236112800">Liquidity ratios show the ability of the company to pay short-term obligations if they came due immediately with assets that can be quickly converted to cash. This is done by comparing current assets to current liabilities. Lenders, for example, may consider the outcomes of liquidity ratios when deciding whether to extend a loan to a company. A company would like to be liquid enough to manage any currently due obligations but not too liquid where they may not be effectively investing in growth opportunities. Three common liquidity measurements are working capital, current ratio, and quick ratio.</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm249902640">Working capital measures the financial health of an organization in the short-term by finding the difference between current assets and current liabilities. A company will need enough current assets to cover current liabilities; otherwise, they may not be able to continue operations in the future. Before a lender extends credit, they will review the working capital of the company to see if the company can meet their obligations. A larger difference signals that a company can cover their short-term debts and a lender may be more willing to extend the loan. On the other hand, too large of a difference may indicate that the company may not be correctly using their assets to grow the business. The formula for working capital is:</p>

To stay in business the company must generate more revenue than debt in the long-term. Meeting long-term obligations includes the ability to pay any interest incurred on long-term debt. Two main solvency ratios are the debt-to-equity ratio and the times interest earned ratio.</p>

A company can take out loans, issue stock, and retain earnings to be used in future periods to keep operations running. It is less risky and less costly to use equity sources for financing as compared to debt resources. This is mainly due to interest expense repayment that a loan carries as opposed to equity, which does not have this requirement. Therefore, a company wants to know how much debt and equity contribute to its financing. Ideally, a company would prefer more equity than debt financing. The formula for the debt to equity ratio is:</p>

<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm245543360">There are several advantages and disadvantages to financial statement analysis. Financial statement analysis can show trends over time, which can be helpful in making future business decisions. Converting information to percentages or ratios eliminates some of the disparity between competitor sizes and operating abilities, making it easier for stakeholders to make informed decisions. It can assist with understanding the makeup of current operations within the business, and which shifts need to occur internally to increase productivity.</p>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm212405888">A stakeholder needs to keep in mind that past performance does not always dictate future performance. Attention must be given to possible economic influences that could skew the numbers being analyzed, such as inflation or a recession. Additionally, the way a company reports information within accounts may change over time. For example, where and when certain transactions are recorded may shift, which may not be readily evident in the financial statements.</p>
<p id="auto_7b0acdae-a602-4ff3-ad0f-814d36f6fea4_fs-idm226824000">A company that wants to budget properly, control costs, increase revenues, and make long-term expenditure decisions may want to use financial statement analysis to guide future operations. As long as the company understands the limitations of the information provided, financial statement analysis is a good tool to predict growth and company financial strength.</p>
