The text also includes many current examples, which are handled in a politically equitable way. The second edition has been thoroughly revised to increase clarity, update data and current event impacts, and incorporate the feedback from many reviewers and adopters. </p>

          <h4 data-type="title">Coverage and scope</h4>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-617">For the second edition, we received expansive and actionable feedback from hundreds of adopters who had used the book for several academic terms. These knowledgeable instructors informed the pedagogical courses, learning objective development and fulfillment, and the chapter arrangements. Faculty who taught from the material provided critical and detailed commentary.</p>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-id1169327261430">The result is a book that covers the breadth of economics topics and also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike. We strove to balance theory and application, as well as the amount of calculation and mathematical examples.  </p>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-734">The book is organized into eight main parts:</p>
          <ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-679">
            <li><strong>What is Economics?</strong>  The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on making choices in a world of scarce resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Supply and Demand</strong>, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.</li>
            <li><strong>The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory</strong>, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics portion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different models of market structure, including some simple game theory.</li>
            <li><strong>Microeconomic Policy Issues</strong>, Chapters 11 through 18, covers the range of topics in applied micro, framed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities.  Students explore competition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor market issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, as well as public economy.</li>
            <li><strong>The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals</strong>, Chapters 19 through 23, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows.</li>
            <li><strong>A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis</strong>, Chapters 24 through 26, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.  The model is then applied to the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives.  The expenditure-output model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.</li>
            <li><strong>Monetary and Fiscal Policy</strong>, Chapters 27 through 31, explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary policy and financial regulation.  Then the discussion switches to government deficits and fiscal policy.</li>
            <li><strong>International Economics</strong>, Chapters 32 through 34, the final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

</li>

          <h4 data-type="title">Changes to the second edition</h4>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-272">OpenStax only undertakes revisions when significant modifications to a text are necessary. In the case of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, we received a wealth of constructive feedback.  Many of the book&#x2019;s users felt that consequential movement in economic data, coupled with the impacts of national and global events, warranted a full revision. We also took advantage of the opportunity to improve the writing and sequencing of the text, as well as many of the calculation examples. The major changes are summarized below.</p>
          <ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-447">
            <li>Augmented explanations in chapters one through four provide a more comprehensive and informative foundation for the book. </li>
            <li>A clearer explanation, using a numerical example, has been given for finding the utility maximizing combination of goods and services a consumer should choose.</li>
            <li>The Theory of Production has been added to the chapter on costs &amp; industry structure.</li>
            <li> A more complete treatment has been given to labor markets, including the theories of competitive and monopsonistic labor markets, and bilateral monopoly; and the labor markets chapter and the poverty and
economic inequality chapter have been resequenced.</li>
            <li>Substantial revisions to the AD/AS model in chapters 24-26 present the core concepts of macroeconomics in a clearer, more dynamic manner. </li>
            <li>Case studies and examples have been revised and, in some cases, replaced to provide more relevant and useful information for students.</li>
            <li>Economic data, tables, and graphs, as well as discussion and analysis around that data, have been thoroughly updated.</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-318">Wherever possible, data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) was included and referenced.  In most of these uses, links to the direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged to explore the information and the overall FRED resources more thoroughly.

</p>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-594">Additional updates and revisions appear throughout the book.  They reflect changes to economic realities and policies regarding international trade, taxation, insurance, and other topics.  For issues that may change in the months or years following the textbook's publication, the authors often provided a more open-ended explanation, but we will update the text annually to address further changes. </p>

</p>
          <ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-213">
            <li><strong>Bring It Home:</strong> This added feature is a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter&#x2019;s main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts:  the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the intro module) and the second at chapter&#x2019;s end, when students have learned what&#x2019;s necessary to understand the case and &#x201C;bring home&#x201D; the chapter&#x2019;s core concepts.</li>
            <li><strong>Work It Out:</strong> This added feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them step by step to find out how its solution is derived. </li>
            <li><strong>Clear It Up:</strong> This boxed feature, which includes pre-existing features from Taylor&#x2019;s text, addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts with a question.  The rest of the feature explains the answer.</li>
            <li><strong>Link It Up:</strong> This added feature is a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students&#x2019; understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.  </li>

</p>
          <ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-284">
            <li><strong>Self-Checks</strong> are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They &#x201C;click to reveal&#x201D; an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think beyond what is said in the text.  Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through the problem.  </li>
            <li><strong>Review Questions</strong> have been retained from Taylor&#x2019;s version, and are simple recall questions from the chapter in open-response format (not multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text. </li>
            <li><strong>Critical Thinking Questions</strong> are new higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to <em data-effect="italics">demonstrate their understanding by applying</em> what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for outside-the-box thinking, for <em data-effect="italics">reasoning</em> about the concepts. They push the student to places they wouldn&#x2019;t have thought of going themselves.  </li>
            <li><strong>Problems</strong> are exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and computational concepts in the module. </li>

the importance of education and the role that literacy would play in realizing their dreams of freedom and opportunity. When Cheyney University, the nation&#x2019;s first Historically Black College and University, was founded in the early 19th century, the ability to read and write printed texts was the goal of gaining literacy. Now, reading and writing provide the foundation for multiple literacies in various professional fields, social contexts, and both print and electronic media (Credit: N. Giovannucci).</span>

              <p id="auto_f4d4370c-dc05-4cb0-8dd1-be7b77359505_first">One path to learning the language of any institution of higher learning, also known as the <span data-type="term" group-by="a" id="auto_page_f4d4370c-dc05-4cb0-8dd1-be7b77359505_term1">academy</span>, is what professors like to call &#x201C;entering the academic discourse community.&#x201D; This phrase means that you to begin to reflect on the experiences that have laid the path for your admission to this new community. In the traditional sense, when talking about <span data-type="term" group-by="l" id="auto_page_f4d4370c-dc05-4cb0-8dd1-be7b77359505_term2">literacy</span>, people typically think of reading and writing. However, in the modern multimedia and kinesthetic world, the definition of <em data-effect="italics">literacy</em> has been expanded to mean "competence in communication," including a multitude of methods, modes, and texts. People are considered literate in almost any concentrated area in which they demonstrate knowledge.
  </p>
              <p id="auto_f4d4370c-dc05-4cb0-8dd1-be7b77359505_eip-977">Having a broad understanding of literacy allows individuals to think about the <span data-type="term" group-by="g" id="auto_page_f4d4370c-dc05-4cb0-8dd1-be7b77359505_term3">genre</span> (writing type) of the <span data-type="term" group-by="l" id="auto_page_f4d4370c-dc05-4cb0-8dd1-be7b77359505_term4">literacy narrative</span> in many ways: ways that are textual, musical, digital, social, communal&#x2014;the list continues. What we know for certain is that literacy involves individual as well as community engagement. One does not achieve literacy through isolation but also as a result of active engagement among members within communities.</p>
              <p id="auto_f4d4370c-dc05-4cb0-8dd1-be7b77359505_eip-407">The literacy narrative is a genre that provides an account of individuals or members of a community and their experiences with learning. Combining the broad definition of <em data-effect="italics">literacy</em> with the term <em data-effect="italics">narrative</em>, or "storytelling," produces the literacy narrative: a story that provides an account of a learning experience. As you begin to reflect on what it means to learn, this chapter will guide you through an exploration of the various features of the literacy narrative genre to prepare you to write one of your own.</p>

As members of different communities, most people speak and write in a number of English varieties without even thinking about doing so. Like others, you generally speak differently with friends than with elders. You usually use different types of language in texting on phones than when writing professional emails. As you make these communication choices in different settings, you signal your identity and culture through word choice, sentence structure, and understanding of language use in specific situations. For example, when speaking with friends, you may engage in wordplay to show identification with the group. On the other hand, you may speak with respect to elders to show an identity as a well-mannered younger relative, and you may use a standard email format to show a professional identity.

</p>
            <p id="auto_c94c7ae0-0c9f-4249-817b-560d3c686ed5_eip-730">Every time you communicate, you signal some aspect of your identity. In the same way that everyone has multiple, intersecting identities, everyone has multiple ways of expressing themselves through language. As members of a multiethnic, multicultural society, everyone should recognize and respect these personal ways of communicating, which are integral to a shared human experience.</p>

Even though individuals speak and write effectively by using different varieties of English, many people nevertheless believe that one standard, &#x201C;proper&#x201D; English variety exists and that this &#x201C;correct&#x201D; way of speaking and writing should be used universally in all settings. This viewpoint considers varieties of English outside the imagined norm to be &#x201C;wrong,&#x201D; &#x201C;bad,&#x201D; or &#x201C;substandard.&#x201D; For example, speakers of some Southern English varieties are often judged as &#x201C;poor&#x201D; or &#x201C;unintelligent.&#x201D; If you speak and write using one of those undervalued English varieties, others may have judged you for your language use or told you that your writing is &#x201C;wrong.&#x201D; Even without such judgement, you may have felt apprehensive when sharing your writing with others; you still may fear a harsh assessment, or you may feel vulnerable when others see your compositions.

              <span class="os-text">The truth is that people speak and write in different ways for different <span data-type="term" group-by="r" id="auto_page_c94c7ae0-0c9f-4249-817b-560d3c686ed5_term9">rhetorical situations</span> (instances of communication). People in different communities and professions employ distinct kinds of English. You already use different varieties of English in different parts of your life; as you progress through college and into your career, you will learn the language expectations for the rhetorical situations you will encounter in those spaces. In learning these expectations, you will gain new identities. For example, you may become someone who knows how to write an exemplary lab report, you could develop an identity as an emerging researcher in any number of fields, or you simply may become someone who is comfortable letting other people see your writing. These new linguistic identities do not need to replace your language use in other areas of your life. For instance, you should not feel the need to use a different form of grammar or punctuation in your social media posts. You should feel comfortable using your familiar English varieties in familiar rhetorical situations and, if needed, use new varieties of English you may learn in the new rhetorical situations you encounter. Additionally, you can, and should, seek out opportunities to use your familiar, nonacademic English varieties in academic and professional settings when you feel it is appropriate and aligns with the expectations of your instructor or employer.

As you become more familiar with the ways English is used in different settings and communities, you can choose which variety to use. You also may choose whether to meet or to disrupt the expectations of the people you are communicating with. In making these choices, you will rely on your existing literacies as well as newly learned ones.

            <span class="os-text">In her 2018 best seller, <em data-effect="italics">Educated: A Memoir</em>, Tara Westover considers the effects of academic and nonacademic literacies in her life. She also contemplates the ways that identification with certain literacies can both create and disturb an individual's relationships and community memberships. While <em data-effect="italics">Educated: A Memoir</em> addresses a variety of themes&#x2014;including the tensions that family members must confront when they disagree&#x2014;the memoir can be read largely as a literacy narrative, or story about learning literacies.</span>
          </p>
          <p id="auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-240">Early in the memoir, Westover discusses a range of literacies she developed as the youngest of seven children in a home-schooled family. Although she was taught to read, her literary world consisted almost exclusively of the Mormon Bible and other religious texts. Her other literacies included preserving food, preparing herbs, and caring for the animals on the family farm, located on an Idaho mountain. She felt a keen sense of belonging both to her family and to their mountain home. Westover also learned how to work in, and survive, the dangerous junkyard her family owned and operated. Even though many family members sustained a variety of horrific accidents and injuries over the years&#x2014;mostly at the junkyard or in car accidents&#x2014;the family relied entirely on natural remedies; both parents considered doctors and medicine to be sinful. Despite the range of literacies Westover learned at home, her parents did not value formal schooling and were indifferent to developing a broad understanding of science, history, and current events. The Westover children were almost entirely self-directed in their academic studies.
</p>
          <p id="auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-653">When Tara was a young child, she fully embraced her parents&#x2019; beliefs that &#x201C;government schooling&#x201D; was wholly unchristian and equivalent to brainwashing. Her brother Tyler, however, had always loved &#x201C;book learning&#x201D; and decided to leave home to attend college. Even he could not fully articulate why he felt compelled to be the first to leave, but his departure intrigued Tara. She, too, began to think about pursuing higher education. After another brother had become physically abusive toward Tara, Tyler encouraged her to use college as an escape. She then bought an ACT prep book, studied on her own, and did well enough on the exams to be accepted to Brigham Young University. </p>
          <p id="auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-83">She articulates in her memoir that once on campus, she realized how much her haphazard homeschooling experience had left her with large gaps in knowledge and no preparation for studying and taking tests. As she improved her academic skills, she also learned methods of academic inquiry that were at odds with her parents&#x2019; faith-based interpretations of both world and personal events.
</p>
          <p class="has-noteref" id="auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-402">As Westover gained a different worldview through her college experience, she struggled to integrate her new understandings with her family&#x2019;s perspectives: in other words, her new literacies were at odds with her old ones. She still felt connected to her family, but her new understanding of the world was irreconcilable with her father&#x2019;s survivalist, fundamentalist beliefs. When she refused to submit to her father&#x2019;s will and return to his rigid world view and interpretation of Mormonism, Tara Westover&#x2019;s relationship with most of her family members disintegrated. Instead, she used her academic literacies to examine the history of their religion in her doctoral research. All three Westover children who left the mountain&#x2014;and to some extent, their family&#x2014;earned PhDs. The four who stayed near the family home have had little formal education.<a href="#auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-idm252391136" role="doc-noteref" type="noteref">1</a>

          <p id="auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-186">For Westover, the schism with her family was not primarily the result of her literacy learning; rather, the relationship ruptured because she refused to repudiate her newfound knowledge as inferior to her family&#x2019;s ways of knowing. In subsequent interviews, Westover discusses the loss she felt in being cut off from her family and place of origin. Although many college students experience similar challenges integrating new ways of encountering the world with their family&#x2019;s views of &#x201C;how things are&#x201D; or &#x201C;how things should be,&#x201D; some families feel enriched by the new information, whereas others feel threatened by it.

          <p id="auto_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594_eip-151">Over time, people have developed specific ways of writing for particular rhetorical situations. These distinctive ways of writing can be referred to, in part, as genres. You may have heard the term genre in reference to publishing categories, such as novels or memoirs, but the term can refer to any type of writing that conforms to specific forms and benchmarks. Many genres include stories of different kinds: for example, folktales, short stories, accounts of events, and biography. As author Jonathan Gottschall says, humankind is &#x201C;the storytelling animal&#x201D;; people of all cultures have always engaged in telling stories, both as storytellers and as audience members. Simply put, narrative stories are essential to many genres of writing.</p>

            <p id="auto_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594_eip-245">Narratives, whether about literacy or anything else, include these key elements:
</p>
            <ul id="auto_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594_eip-178">
              <li><strong>Plot</strong> Authors of narratives tell about one or more events. In fiction, the plot is the sequence of those events. In nonfiction a plot is often referred to simply as the events, but they follow similar plot patterns of an exposition or introduction, series of events leading to a climax or discovery, and events following the climax or discovery.</li>
              <li><strong>Characters</strong> The events in the story happen to characters, or individuals who are part of the story. In nonfiction, these characters are usually real people. The audience should feel a connection to the main character or characters. Readers may like or dislike characters, blame them or feel sorry for them, identify with them or not. Skilled writers portray characters through the use of dialogue, actions or behavior, and thoughts so that readers can see for themselves what these individuals are like.</li>
              <li><strong>Setting</strong> Stories, fiction and nonfiction, take place in settings, which include locations, time periods, and the cultures in which the characters or real people are immersed.</li>
              <li><strong>Problem and Resolution</strong> In narratives, the characters generally encounter one or more problems. The tensions caused by the problem build to a climax. The resolution of the problem and the built-up tensions usually occur near the end of the story.</li>
              <li><strong>Story Arc</strong> Most narratives have a story arc&#x2014;a beginning, a middle, and an end&#x2014;but not necessarily in that order. The story arc, or order of events, may occur chronologically, or the story may begin in the middle of the action and explain earlier events later in the sequence.</li>
            </ul>

              <li><strong>Action</strong> Vivid portrayal of the events in the story. Writers often use short sentences and strong verbs to indicate physical or mental action.</li>

            <p id="auto_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594_eip-469">
Most important, the audience must feel that the story has some significance. While the author&#x2019;s main point may only be implied, rather than stated outright as in a conventional academic essay, readers should understand the point of the story and believe that it matters. The following elements, therefore, are crucial for writers of narratives to consider.
</p>
            <ul id="auto_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594_eip-348">
              <li><strong>Audience</strong> Narratives are designed to appeal to specific audiences; authors choose storytelling elements, details, and language strategies to engage the target audience.
</li>
              <li><strong>Purpose</strong> Authors may tell stories for different reasons: to entertain, reinforce cultural norms, educate, or to strengthen social ties. The same story may, and often does, fulfill more than one purpose.

            <p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_fs-idm244697456">Very soon after I went to live with Mr. and Mrs. Auld, she very kindly commenced to teach me the A, B, C. After I had learned this, she assisted me in learning to spell words of three or four letters. Just at this point of my progress, Mr. Auld found out what was going on, and at once forbade Mrs. Auld to instruct me further, telling her, among other things, that it was unlawful, as well as unsafe, to teach a slave to read.
</p>
            <p class="annotation-text" id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm252495488">Here Douglass describes the background situation and the culture of the time, which he will defy in his quest for literacy. The word choice in his narration of events indicates he is writing for an educated audience.
</p>
            <p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-177">To use his own words, further, he said, "If you give a nigger an inch, he will take an ell. A nigger should know nothing but to obey his master&#x2014;to do as he is told to do. Learning would spoil the best nigger in the world. Now," said he, "if you teach that nigger (speaking of myself) how to read, there would be no keeping him. It would forever unfit him to be a slave. He would at once become unmanageable, and of no value to his master. As to himself, it could do him no good, but a great deal of harm. It would make him discontented and unhappy."
</p>
            <p class="annotation-text" id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm247588576">In sharing this part of the narrative, Douglass underscores the importance of literacy. He provides a description of Mr. Auld, a slaveholder, who seeks to use literacy as a means to oppress others. In this description of Mr. Auld&#x2019;s reaction, Douglass shows that slaveholders feared the power that enslaved people would have if they could read and write. Douglass provides the details of Auld&#x2019;s dialogue not only because it is a convention of narrative genre, but also because it demonstrates a purpose for his forthcoming pursuit of literacy. We have chosen to maintain the authenticity of the original text by using the language that Douglass offers to quote Mr. Auld&#x2019;s dialogue because it both provides context for the rhetorical situation, as well as underscores the value of the attainment of literacy for Douglass. However, contemporary audiences must understand that under no circumstance should this language be uttered in current rhetorical situations. </p>
            <p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm244726480">These words sank deep into my heart, stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering, and called into existence an entirely new train of thought. It was a new and special revelation, explaining dark and mysterious things, with which my youthful understanding had struggled, but struggled in vain. I now understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty&#x2014;to wit, the white man's power to enslave the black man. It was a grand achievement, and I prized it highly. From that moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom. It was just what I wanted, and I got it at a time when I the least expected it. Whilst I was saddened by the thought of losing the aid of my kind mistress, I was gladdened by the invaluable instruction which, by the merest accident, I had gained from my master.

It was a new and special revelation, explaining dark and mysterious things, with which my youthful understanding had struggled, but struggled in vain. I now understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty&#x2014;to wit, the white man's power to enslave the black man. It was a grand achievement, and I prized it highly. From that moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom. It was just what I wanted, and I got it at a time when I the least expected it.

            <p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm245771440">Though conscious of the difficulty of learning without a teacher, I set out with high hope, and a fixed purpose, at whatever cost of trouble, to learn how to read. The very decided manner with which he spoke, and strove to impress his wife with the evil consequences of giving me instruction, served to convince me that he was deeply sensible of the truths he was uttering. It gave me the best assurance that I might rely with the utmost confidence on the results which, he said, would flow from teaching me to read. What he most dreaded, that I most desired. What he most loved, that I most hated. That which to him was a great evil, to be carefully shunned, was to me a great good, to be diligently sought; and the argument which he so warmly urged, against my learning to read, only served to inspire me with a desire and determination to learn. In learning to read, I owe almost as much to the bitter opposition of my master, as to the kindly aid of my mistress. I acknowledge the benefit of both.

The rhythm, sentence structure, and poetic phrasing in this reflection provide further evidence that Douglass does actively pursue and master language after having this experience with Mr. Auld.</p>

During this time, I succeeded in learning to read and write. In accomplishing this, I was compelled to resort to various stratagems. I had no regular teacher. My mistress, who had kindly commenced to instruct me, had, in compliance with the advice and direction of her husband, not only ceased to instruct, but had set her face against my being instructed by any one else. It is due, however, to my mistress to say of her, that she did not adopt this course of treatment immediately. She at first lacked the depravity indispensable to shutting me up in mental darkness. It was at least necessary for her to have some training in the exercise of irresponsible power, to make her equal to the task of treating me as though I were a brute.
</p>
            <p class="annotation-text" id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm247149776">Douglass describes in detail a person in his life and his relationship to her. He uses examples of her kindness&#x2014;a tear for the suffering, bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked and comfort for the mourner.</p>
            <p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm246833520"> My mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced, when I first went to live with her, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another. In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but dangerously so. Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me. When I went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman. There was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear. She had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities. Under its influence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness. The first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me. She now commenced to practise her husband's precepts. She finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself. </p>
            <p class="annotation-text" id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm244715024">The fact that Douglass can understand the harm of the institution of slavery on enslaved people as well as on slaveholders shows a level of sophistication in thought, identifies the complexity and detriment of this historical period, and demonstrates an acute awareness of the rhetorical situation, especially on his audience for this text. The way that he articulates compassion for the slaveholders, despite their ill treatment of him, would create empathy in his readers and have a transformative impact on his audience.

Nothing seemed to make her more angry than to see me with a newspaper. She seemed to think that here lay the danger. I have had her rush at me with a face made all up of fury, and snatch from me a newspaper, in a manner that fully revealed her apprehension. She was an apt woman; and a little experience soon demonstrated, to her satisfaction, that education and slavery were incompatible with each other.</p>
            <p class="annotation-text" id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm253167984">Once again, Douglass underscores the value that literacy has on transforming the lived experiences of enslaved people.</p>
            <p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm242186640">From this time I was most narrowly watched. If I was in a separate room any considerable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of having a book, and was at once called to give an account of myself. All this, however, was too late. The first step had been taken. Mistress, in teaching me the alphabet, had given me the <em data-effect="italics">inch</em>, and no precaution could prevent me from taking the <em data-effect="italics">ell</em>.</p>
            <p class="annotation-text" id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm242254848">The reference to the <em data-effect="italics">inch</em> and the <em data-effect="italics">ell</em> recalls Mr. Auld's warnings.</p>
            <p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm248458736">The plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most successful, was that of making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in the street. As many of these as I could, I converted into teachers. With their kindly aid, obtained at different times and in different places, I finally succeeded in learning to read. When I was sent of errands, I always took my book with me, and by going one part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return. I used also to carry bread with me, enough of which was always in the house, and to which I was always welcome; for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood. This bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge. I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence forbids;&#x2014;not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian country.
</p>
            <p class="annotation-text" id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm255728256">Douglass comments on the culture of the time, which still permitted slavery; he is sensitive to the fact that these boys might be embarrassed by their participation in unacceptable, though humanitarian, behavior. His tone, too, seems sarcastic when he writes that it is an "unpardonable offense to teach slaves &#x2026; in this Christian country." Such behavior is surely "unchristian."</p>
            <p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm247626400">It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that they lived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard. I used to talk this matter of slavery over with them. I would sometimes say to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got to be men. "You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, <em data-effect="italics">but I am a slave for life</em>! Have not I as good a right to be free as you have?" These words used to trouble them; they would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope that something would occur by which I might be free.</p>
            <p class="annotation-text" id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm387517920">Douglass pursues and attains literacy not only for his own benefit but his knowledge also allows him to begin to instruct, as well as advocate for, those around him. Douglass's use of language and understanding of the rhetorical situation give the audience evidence of the power of literacy for all people, round out the arc of his narrative, and provide a resolution.</p>

          <p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-621">Many inexperienced writers imagine that &#x201C;good&#x201D; writers compose their texts all at once from beginning to end and need only a small amount of attention to polish the grammar and punctuation before arriving at a final draft. In reality, however, the <span data-type="term" group-by="w" id="auto_page_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_term13">writing process</span> (steps for creating a finished composition) is typically <span data-type="term" group-by="r" id="auto_page_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_term14">recursive</span>. That is, it repeats steps multiple times, not necessarily in the same order, and the process is more messy than linear or systematic. You can think of the writing process in these broad categories:
</p>
          <ul id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-536">
            <li><strong>Prewriting</strong> You will end up with a stronger composition if you do some work before you begin writing. Before putting words on a page, take some time to think about the rhetorical situation for your writing, gather your thoughts, and consider how you might arrange your ideas.</li>
            <li><strong>Drafting</strong> In the past, you may have dedicated most of your writing time to drafting, or putting words into a document. When you have strong prewriting and revision habits, however, drafting is often a smaller portion of the writing process. </li>
            <li><strong>Peer Review</strong> Almost all strong writers rely on feedback from others, whether peers, instructors, or editors. Your instructor may guide you in some peer review exercises to complete with your classmates, or you might choose to consult with your university&#x2019;s writing center. When others give you clear, honest feedback on your draft, you can use that information to strengthen your piece.</li>
            <li><strong>Revision</strong> After you have a draft, carefully consider how to make it more effective in reaching the audience and fulfilling its purpose. You can make changes that affect the piece as a whole; such changes are often called global revisions. Conversely, you can make changes that affect only the meaning of a sentence or word; these changes can be called local revisions.</li>
          </ul>

In this assignment, you will write an essay in which you offer a developed <strong>narrative</strong> about an aspect of your <strong>literacy</strong> practice or experience. Consider some of these questions: <em data-effect="italics"> When did this engagement occur? Where were you? Were there other participants? Have you told this story before? If so, how often, and why do you think you return to it? Has this engagement shaped your current literacy practices? Has it shaped your practices going forward?

As an alternative, develop a set of interview questions with the members in your composition course community that will allow you to learn more about their past and present experiences with literacy. After the composition course community has determined what the interview questions will be, choose a partner from the composition community to work with on this assignment. Using interview questions you have discussed and developed, conduct an interview with your partner. Your instructor will allow you and your peers to record and transcribe one another&#x2019;s responses and post them where all students in the community have access. After you have completed, transcribed, and posted your interviews, everyone will closely examine each of their peer&#x2019;s interviews and look for recurring themes, as well as particularly unique aspects, of the narratives shared. This assignment will inevitably illuminate the communal nature, as well as the unique, independent experiences of literacy engagement.

Now that you have planned your Literacy Narrative, you are ready to begin drafting. If you have been thoughtful in preparing to write, drafting usually proceeds quickly and smoothly. Use your notes to guide you in composing the first draft. As you write about specific events and scenes, create a rich picture for your reader by using concrete, sensory details and specific rather than general nouns.

As Douglass does, create your Literacy Narrative from your recollections of people, places, events, and events. Reread the following passage.

As many of these as I could, I converted into teachers. With their kindly aid, obtained at different times and in different places, I finally succeeded in learning to read. When I was sent of errands, I always took my book with me, and by going one part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return. I used also to carry bread with me, enough of which was always in the house, and to which I was always welcome; for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood. This bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge. I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence forbids;&#x2014;not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian country. It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that they lived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard. I used to talk this matter of slavery over with them. I would sometimes say to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got to be men. "You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, <em data-effect="italics">but I am a slave for life</em>! Have not I as good a right to be free as you have?" These words used to trouble them; they would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope that something would occur by which I might be free.</p>
              <p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-985">In this selection from the <em data-effect="italics">Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</em>, elements of the Literacy Narrative genre as explained in <a href="#page_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594">Glance at Genre: The Literacy Narrative</a> are evident. First, Douglass introduces additional characters who help him resolve his earlier complication of being prevented from learning to read by the Aulds. The interaction he records here reiterates the larger conflict of the narrative: Douglass&#x2019;s continuing enslavement. Although he does not give many scenic details, few more would be needed, for he places the action on the street near a shipyard, thereby giving an indication of the surroundings. Douglass presents his own words in dialogue to reinforce for readers that he knows how to speak and write in the ways that white people with means were taught at the time. In this piece, set against the backdrop of a culture that insisted on viewing enslaved people as &#x201C;brutes,&#x201D; Douglass demonstrates his dignity by displaying his facility with language and his humanity by offering bread to hungry children who had more freedom and opportunity, but less food, than he does. </p>
              <p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-47">To create a draft that draws on multiple elements of storytelling, as this selection from Douglass does, you may need to generate ideas for additional scenes, or you may need to revisit a particular place so that you can provide concrete and sensory details for your readers. To visualize these additional scenes, try storyboarding.

You may not need all the boxes, or you may need more, depending on your story arc. Use the descriptions of the story parts as you begin to complete the diagrams and draft your narrative.

The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me. I am filled with wonder when I consider the immeasurable contrasts between the two lives which it connects. It was the third of March, 1887, three months before I was seven years old.</p>

On the afternoon of that eventful day, I stood on the porch, dumb, expectant. I guessed vaguely from my mother's signs and from the hurrying to and fro in the house that something unusual was about to happen, so I went to the door and waited on the steps. The afternoon sun penetrated the mass of honeysuckle that covered the porch, and fell on my upturned face. My fingers lingered almost unconsciously on the familiar leaves and blossoms which had just come forth to greet the sweet southern spring. I did not know what the future held of marvel or surprise for me. Anger and bitterness had preyed upon me continually for weeks and a deep languor had succeeded this passionate struggle.</p>

Have you ever been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in, and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding-line, and you waited with beating heart for something to happen? I was like that ship before my education began, only I was without compass or sounding-line, and had no way of knowing how near the harbour was. "Light! give me light!" was the wordless cry of my soul, and the light of love shone on me in that very hour.</p>
              <p class="public-domain" id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm249135088">
I felt approaching footsteps, I stretched out my hand as I supposed to my mother. Some one took it, and I was caught up and held close in the arms of her who had come to reveal all things to me, and, more than all things else, to love me.</p>
              <p class="public-domain" id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm247044816">
The morning after my teacher came she led me into her room and gave me a doll. The little blind children at the Perkins Institution had sent it and Laura Bridgman had dressed it; but I did not know this until afterward. When I had played with it a little while, Miss Sullivan slowly spelled into my hand the word "d-o-l-l." I was at once interested in this finger play and tried to imitate it. When I finally succeeded in making the letters correctly I was flushed with childish pleasure and pride. Running downstairs to my mother I held up my hand and made the letters for doll. I did not know that I was spelling a word or even that words existed; I was simply making my fingers go in monkey-like imitation. In the days that followed I learned to spell in this uncomprehending way a great many words, among them pin, hat, cup and a few verbs like sit, stand and walk. But my teacher had been with me several weeks before I understood that everything has a name.</p>
              <p class="public-domain" id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm245159008">
One day, while I was playing with my new doll, Miss Sullivan put my big rag doll into my lap also, spelled "d-o-l-l" and tried to make me understand that "d-o-l-l" applied to both. Earlier in the day we had had a tussle over the words "m-u-g" and "w-a-t-e-r." Miss Sullivan had tried to impress it upon me that "m-u-g" is mug and that "w-a-t-e-r" is water, but I persisted in confounding the two. In despair she had dropped the subject for the time, only to renew it at the first opportunity. I became impatient at her repeated attempts and, seizing the new doll, I dashed it upon the floor. I was keenly delighted when I felt the fragments of the broken doll at my feet. Neither sorrow nor regret followed my passionate outburst. I had not loved the doll. In the still, dark world in which I lived there was no strong sentiment or tenderness. I felt my teacher sweep the fragments to one side of the hearth, and I had a sense of satisfaction that the cause of my discomfort was removed. She brought me my hat, and I knew I was going out into the warm sunshine. This thought, if a wordless sensation may be called a thought, made me hop and skip with pleasure.</p>
              <p class="public-domain" id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm245156208">
We walked down the path to the well-house, attracted by the fragrance of the honeysuckle with which it was covered. Some one was drawing water and my teacher placed my hand under the spout. As the cool stream gushed over one hand she spelled into the other the word water, first slowly, then rapidly. I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motions of her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten&#x2014;a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me. I knew then that "w-a-t-e-r" meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living word awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free! There were barriers still, it is true, but barriers that could in time be swept away.</p>
              <p class="public-domain" id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm245155824">
I left the well-house eager to learn. Everything had a name, and each name gave birth to a new thought. As we returned to the house every object which I touched seemed to quiver with life. That was because I saw everything with the strange, new sight that had come to me. On entering the door I remembered the doll I had broken. I felt my way to the hearth and picked up the pieces. I tried vainly to put them together. Then my eyes filled with tears; for I realized what I had done, and for the first time I felt repentance and sorrow.</p>
              <p class="public-domain" id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm241383424">
I learned a great many new words that day. I do not remember what they all were; but I do know that mother, father, sister, teacher were among them&#x2014;words that were to make the world blossom for me, "like Aaron's rod, with flowers." It would have been difficult to find a happier child than I was as I lay in my crib at the close of that eventful day and lived over the joys it had brought me, and for the first time longed for a new day to come.

Both use figurative language&#x2014;"bread of knowledge"&#x2014;and make allusions to Christianity. However, Douglass uses dialogue to illustrate a social disparity, whereas Keller's transformation and her language are largely internal. Make use of the strategies that best fit your own literacy narrative.</p>

 Although the writing process does not always occur in a prescribed sequence (you can sometimes move between steps of the process in a variety of ways), participating in peer review is a necessary, and often critical, part of the writing process. Having the response and feedback of an outside reader can help you shape your writing into work that makes you proud. A peer review occurs when someone at your level (a peer) offers an evaluation of your writing. Instructors aid in this process by giving you and your peers judgment criteria and guidelines to follow, and the feedback of the reader should help you revise your writing before your instructor evaluates it and offers a grade.
</p>
            <p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-881">When given the opportunity to engage in a peer review activity, use the following steps to provide your peers with effective, evidence-based feedback for their writing. </p>
            <ul id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-841">
              <li>Review all the criteria and guidelines for the assignment.</li>
              <li>Read the writing all the way through carefully before offering any feedback.</li>
              <li>Read the peer review exercise, tool, or instrument provided by the instructor. </li>
              <li>Apply and complete the peer review exercise while rereading the work. </li>
              <li>Provide feedback to your peer. Your comments should focus on these questions: <em data-effect="italics">In what ways are the organization and coherence of the narrative logical and clear so that you can follow events?  What, if anything, do you not understand or need further explanation about? What do you want to know more about? </em></li>

            <p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-347">Following these steps will give your reading the necessary context and situate your feedback within the criteria and guidelines of the assignment. This process will be critical to the revision process for your peer. In addition, reading and evaluating the work of another, and using the criteria and guidelines for that assignment, will strengthen your writing skills and help you when you revise your own work. </p>

            <p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-113">After you have completed the peer review exercise and received the related constructive feedback, you are ready to revise your literacy narrative in preparation for submission to your instructor for grading and a possible publication venue (See <a href="#page_3cad17d6-8363-4d32-8bbc-eac38f67f7f6">Spotlight on DALN</a>.) The peer review exercise guided you and your partner through a thorough assessment of your narratives. The next step is to take that feedback and make changes to your draft.
</p>
            <p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-866">Look at the criteria in the first row in the peer review chart above, and then look at the evidence for that criteria that your partner listed. <em data-effect="italics">Does your partner&#x2019;s understanding of the parts of your essay match your own? Where are the disconnects between what you intended for a section of your writing and what your partner has read and understood?</em> These points of disconnect are good places to begin your revisions. Your partner represents your audience, so if there are some misunderstandings in the reading of your narrative, you will want to make changes to clarify your writing. </p>
            <p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-447">Imagine you have written a literacy narrative in which you discuss the difficulty in learning to read music. Imagine the opening paragraph with the following sentence: "I have always had a hard time reading music." Your peer reviewer might list in Column 2 for the first criterion on &#x201C;engaging identity&#x201D; that you read music, and that is all. Such a brief and limited assessment might lead your partner to suggest in Column 3 that you strengthen your identity by answering the following questions: </p>
            <ul id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-520">
              <li>When and why did you begin trying to learn to read music?</li>
              <li>Do you come from a musical background? </li>
              <li>Did you have a music reading teacher, or are you self-taught?</li>
              <li>What are you specific challenges to reading music?
</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-751">During the discussion after the written peer review, you might share the details of your learning to play the piano: that you were five years old and that your grandmother was your teacher. Your revision for this opening paragraph might then include a sentence like the following: "I have been struggling to read music since I began playing piano at five years old, when my grandmother, our church musician, gave me my first lesson." This process demonstrates the way in which the peer review should lead to substantive change and revision in your writing. </p>
            <p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-567">You will want to read and discuss the details of the evidence (Column 2) and suggestions (Column 3) for each of the above criteria (Column 1) with your peer review partner. On the basis of your partner&#x2019;s assessment&#x2014;and your own judgment, of course&#x2014;make any necessary revisions before submitting your literacy narrative for grading. The more time you take to go through this process, the more developed and comprehensive your writing will be. Some people may feel anxious about having others read their work, but the scenario provided above demonstrates the valuable ways that a preliminary reading audience can help improve the narrative.</p>

When writers compose early drafts with many short sentences rather than more sophisticated efforts at varied or complex sentence construction, writing appears choppy and disjointed. Once you have a complete draft of your essay, consider combining sentences that provide your audience with more effective and nuanced ways of reading your work. You can combine short, choppy, repetitive sentences into a simple sentence with a compound verb or subject, as in the first example below. Or you can combine the shorter sentences into a complex sentence with a dependent clause, as in the second example.

            <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-798">1a. I learned to play piano. I was five years old. Learning to play piano is my literacy experience. Memorizing the location of the keys is also my literacy experience. <span data-type="newline"><br /></span>

2b. Learning to read as a first grader made me want to become a teacher so that I could share my experiences with future first graders.
</p>
            <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-92">Read through the draft of your essay, and look for sentences that are closely related enough that they can be combined for richer meaning. However, keep in mind that short sentences are effective in your writing, especially when you want to create realistic dialogue or show action. Look to create a balance among sentence length and types to engage your audience. Remember, too, that the best test of whether words are pulling their own weight and providing rhythm, balance, and emphasis is to read the passage out loud. Let your ear tell you what is sharp and clear and what could be sharper and clearer.

If you have often been told to make your sentences clearer, less wordy, or both, but you do not know where to start, this section offers some quick strategies to address some of the most common issues that contribute to unclear or wordy writing.

</p>
            <section data-depth="2" id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-490">
              <h4 data-type="title">Defining "You" and "This"</h4>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-471">
One common pattern that makes writing less clear is the use of you to mean &#x201C;a random person&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;you,&#x201D; the audience. Here is an example, followed by a revision.
</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-idm254962176"> 1a. You must plan your document carefully to connect with your audience.<span data-type="newline"><br /></span>
1b. <u data-effect="underline">Writers</u> must plan their documents carefully to connect with their audiences.
</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-50">This sentence is stronger with the revision clearly indicating who needs to plan their writing. You might be writing a piece addressed directly to the audience, as this text is. If so, be careful to distinguish between the use of you to mean your specific audience&#x2014;appropriate when directly addressing an audience&#x2014;and a hazier use of you that needs clarification. Use the &#x201C;find&#x201D; function to search your document for the word <em data-effect="italics">you</em>, and then replace every unclear you with a definite noun.
</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-745">Another pattern affecting the clarity of written work is using the word <em data-effect="italics">this</em> on its own without an explanation of what &#x201C;this&#x201D; is. Here is an example, along with its revision:</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-675">1a. This can be confusing to the reader.<span data-type="newline"><br /></span>
1b. This <u data-effect="underline">lack of explanation</u> can be confusing to the reader.</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-927">In the first sentence, the audience wonders, &#x201C;This what?&#x201D; In the second sentence, the writer simply adds a noun phrase to explain, and readers will appreciate the clarification. Use the &#x201C;find&#x201D; function to search your document for <em data-effect="italics">this</em>, and make sure you have defined or explained this in all cases.</p>
            </section>
            <section data-depth="2" id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-101">
              <h4 data-type="title">Revising Sentences to Change "There are/there is" or "It is"</h4>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-991">
Readers relate better to sentences that feature a &#x201C;doer&#x201D;&#x2014;someone or something performing an action&#x2014;and an &#x201C;action&#x201D;&#x2014;the activity of the doer. For this reason, writing that overuses the sentence patterns of &#x201C;There are &#x2026;/there is &#x2026;&#x201D; and &#x201C;It is &#x2026;&#x201D; in place of a doer and action can seem unclear, remote, or dull for the reader. As you revise such sentences, you may find at times that you need to insert a doer or an action; one or both may be missing from the first version of the sentence. Here is one example, with a suggested revision.
</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-716">1a. There are many ways to revise written work. <span data-type="newline"><br /></span>
1b. Authors have many ways to revise written work.</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-304">In the first sentence, the "author" is implied, but the second sentence includes a doer for a more reader-friendly version.</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-405">Sentences using the <em data-effect="italics">it is</em> pattern need similar attention to present a doer and an action to the reader. Here is one example and revision.</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-918">1a. It is challenging but rewarding to revise a composition.<span data-type="newline"><br /></span>
   1b. I feel challenged but rewarded when revising a composition.</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-924">Again, the first sentence needs an agent to do the sentence&#x2019;s actions. Use the &#x201C;find&#x201D; function to search your document for &#x201C;there are,&#x201D; &#x201C;there is,&#x201D; and &#x201C;it is,&#x201D; and replace these weaker sentence constructions with doers and actions wherever possible.</p>
            </section>
            <section data-depth="2" id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-839">
              <h4 data-type="title">Eliminating Wordiness.</h4>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-645">
To begin, look at the sentences below to get a sense of what wordiness is. Wordiness does not change or omit information, although it can. In these sentences, though, the information remains the same, but the edited sentence shows a trimmed down version. <em data-effect="italics">There was</em> and <em data-effect="italics">that</em> are eliminated, as is the unnecessary adverb <em data-effect="italics">really</em>, and the phrase <em data-effect="italics">waves in the ocean</em> becomes <em data-effect="italics">ocean waves</em>.
</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-82">1a.  There was a really bright light that was shining on the waves in the ocean.<span data-type="newline"><br /></span>
                1b.  A bright light was shining on the ocean waves.</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-318">In general, try to cut out words that do not add meaning, rhythm, or emphasis. Sentences clogged with unnecessary words cause readers to lose interest, patience, and comprehension. Editing sentences for concrete nouns, action verbs, and well-chosen modifiers will help you weed out unnecessary words. Writing varied and emphatic sentences helps with this task too. Look at the following sentences, which all say essentially the same thing. However, you will see some changes and omissions.</p>
              <ul id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-252">
                <li>In almost every situation that I can think of, except with few exceptions, it will make
good sense for you to look for as many places as possible to cut out needless,
redundant, and repetitive words from the papers and reports, paragraphs and
sentences you write for college assignments. (49 words)</li>
                <li>
In most situations it makes good sense to cut out needless words from your
college papers. (16 words)</li>
                <li>
Whenever possible, omit needless words from your writing. (8 words)
Omit needless words. (3 words)
</li>
              </ul>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-652">The 49-word sentence is full of early-draft language; you can almost visualize the writer finding their way while writing. The 16-word sentence says much the same thing, with far fewer words. Most of this editing simply cut out unnecessary words. Only at the end were several wordy phrases condensed: "from the papers and reports, paragraphs and sentences you write for college assignments" was reduced to "from your college papers." That 16-word sentence was reduced in half by rephrasing and dropping the emphasis on college writing. And that sentence was whittled down by nearly two-thirds, to arrive at the core three-word sentence, "Omit needless words."
</p>
              <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-687">The first sentence is long-winded by any standard or in any context; each of the next
three might serve well in different situations. Thus, when you edit to make language more
concise, think about the overall effect you intend to create. Sometimes the briefest construction is not the best one for your purpose. For example, the three-word sentence is more suited to a brief list than to a sentence of advice for this book.

            This paragraph from a student's first draft of a narrative contains sentences that need editing. Revise the sentences to eliminate <em data-effect="italics">there are/it is</em>; unclear <em data-effect="italics">you</em> and <em data-effect="italics">this</em>; and wordiness. For better flow, combine sentences that are repetitive or choppy.

my paper started and studied for my exam. My eyes are very tired. I get up and leave my comfortable chair. Next I walk out of the library. You have to walk through a glass door. I retrace the path that goes back to my apartment, where I came from earlier.

          <p id="auto_33fcf59e-e164-4049-98a1-54b66c61acaf_eip-281">Your instructor may require a portfolio as a part of the composition course curriculum. A portfolio is a collection of your work, gathered in a single place, for the purpose of assessing your growth and achievement as a writer. A portfolio allows you not only to include writing artifacts but also to reflect on the process of composing those artifacts. In this section, you will have an opportunity to compose a reflection on the process of writing your literacy narrative.</p>

            <p id="auto_33fcf59e-e164-4049-98a1-54b66c61acaf_eip-909">
One of the most valuable writing exercises is to reflect on work that you have completed or experiences that you have had. Reflection supports learning by allowing writers to articulate the impact that experiences have had on various aspects of their lives. In this section, take some time to reflect on your experiences, as well as the experiences of others, with literacy and learning. Using the guidelines your instructor provides, compose a reflection that responds to the following questions:
</p>
            <ul id="auto_33fcf59e-e164-4049-98a1-54b66c61acaf_eip-524">
              <li>Has the opportunity to reflect on your engagement with literacy practices, the practices of those in your composition course community, or the practices of people beyond your immediate community, affected your understanding of literacies?</li>
              <li>
How will this experience and reflection affect future engagement?
</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 data-type="title">Literacy Narrative Revision</h3>
            <p id="auto_33fcf59e-e164-4049-98a1-54b66c61acaf_eip-526">
Submitting the best version of your work is an important part of preparing a portfolio.  After you have received a graded essay with comments from your instructor, use those comments as a source to revise the essay for a final time. You will want to use this revised essay for your portfolio submission.

Each new paragraph signals either a new idea, further development of an existing idea, or a new direction. An effective paragraph has a main point supported by evidence, is organized in a sensible way, and is neither too short nor too long. When a paragraph is too short, it often lacks enough evidence and examples to back up your claims. When a paragraph is too long, readers can lose the point you are making. </p>

Often the main point of the paragraph is expressed in a topic sentence, which announces that point. The topic sentence frequently comes at the start of the paragraph, but not always. No matter the position, however, the rest of the sentences in the paragraph support the main point. </p>

Although experts disagree on the exact numbers, somewhere between 12 percent and 40 percent of retirees count on social security for all of their income, making these benefits especially important (Konish). Even more, these benefits become more important as people age. According to Eisenberg, people who reach the age of 85 become more financially vulnerable because their health care and long-term care costs increase at the same time their savings have been drawn down. It should therefore come as no surprise that people worry about changes to the program. Social Security keeps millions of retired Americans out of poverty. </p>

Readers pay attention to the opening, so make it work for you. After starting with a descriptive title, write an opening paragraph that grabs readers&#x2019; attention and alerts them to what&#x2019;s coming. A strong opening paragraph provides the first clues about your subject and your take on it. Depending on the type of writing you&#x2019;re doing, you can open in a variety of ways.

              <li><strong>Open with the thesis.</strong> Academic writing, whether argumentative, interpretative, or informative, commonly opens with a clear thesis statement that the rest of the paper will support. Often the thesis statement comes at the end of the introduction. </li>
              <li><strong>Open with a conflict.</strong> If you&#x2019;re writing about conflict, a good opening may be to spell out what the conflict is. This way of opening captures attention by creating a kind of suspense: <em data-effect="italics">Will the conflict be resolved? How will it be resolved?</em> </li>
              <li><strong>Open with a story.</strong> Readers enjoy stories. Particularly for reflective or personal narrative writing, beginning with a story sets the scene and draws in readers. </li>
              <li><strong>Open with a specific detail, statistic, or quotation.</strong> Specific information shows that you know a lot about your subject and piques readers&#x2019; curiosity. The more dramatic your information, the more it will draw in readers, as long as what you provide is credible. </li>
            </ul>

The conclusion is your final chance to make the point of your writing stick in readers&#x2019; minds by reinforcing what they have read. You can summarize your main point and restate your thesis, draw a logical conclusion, speculate about the issues you have raised, or recommend further action.

A paragraph flows when ideas are organized logically and sentences move smoothly from one to the next. Transitional words and phrases help your writing flow by signaling to readers what&#x2019;s coming in the next sentence.
