The authors take a balanced approach to micro-and macroeconomics, to both Keynesian and classical views, and to the theory and application of economics concepts.

<li><strong>Supply and Demand</strong>, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.</li>

<li><strong>The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory</strong>, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics portion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different models of market structure, including some simple game theory.</li>
<li><strong>Microeconomic Policy Issues</strong>, Chapters 11 through 18, covers the range of topics in applied micro, framed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities.  Students explore competition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor market issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, as well as public economy.</li>
<li><strong>The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals</strong>, Chapters 19 through 23, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows.</li>
<li><strong>A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis</strong>, Chapters 24 through 26, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.  The model is then applied to the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives.  The expenditure-output model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary and Fiscal Policy</strong>, Chapters 27 through 31, explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary policy and financial regulation.  Then the discussion switches to government deficits and fiscal policy.</li>

<li><strong>International Economics</strong>, Chapters 32 through 34, the final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

In the case of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, we received a wealth of constructive feedback.  Many of the book’s users felt that consequential movement in economic data, coupled with the impacts of national and global events, warranted a full revision. We also took advantage of the opportunity to improve the writing and sequencing of the text, as well as many of the calculation examples. The major changes are summarized below.</p><ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-447"><li>Augmented explanations in chapters one through four provide a more comprehensive and informative foundation for the book. </li>
<li>A clearer explanation, using a numerical example, has been given for finding the utility maximizing combination of goods and services a consumer should choose.</li>
<li>The Theory of Production has been added to the chapter on costs &amp; industry structure.</li>
<li> A more complete treatment has been given to labor markets, including the theories of competitive and monopsonistic labor markets, and bilateral monopoly; and the labor markets chapter and the poverty and
economic inequality chapter have been resequenced.</li>
<li>Substantial revisions to the AD/AS model in chapters 24-26 present the core concepts of macroeconomics in a clearer, more dynamic manner. </li>
<li>Case studies and examples have been revised and, in some cases, replaced to provide more relevant and useful information for students.</li>
<li>Economic data, tables, and graphs, as well as discussion and analysis around that data, have been thoroughly updated.</li> </ul><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-318">Wherever possible, data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) was included and referenced.  In most of these uses, links to the direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged to explore the information and the overall FRED resources more thoroughly.

</p><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-594">Additional updates and revisions appear throughout the book.  They reflect changes to economic realities and policies regarding international trade, taxation, insurance, and other topics.  For issues that may change in the months or years following the textbook's publication, the authors often provided a more open-ended explanation, but we will update the text annually to address further changes. </p><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-204">The revision of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> was undertaken by Steven Greenlaw (University of Mary Washington) and David Shapiro (Pennsylvania State University), with significant input by lead reviewer Daniel MacDonald (California State University, San Bernardino).</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-27"><h4 data-type="title">Pedagogical foundation</h4><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-987">Throughout the OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, you will find new features that engage the students in economic inquiry by taking selected topics a step further. Our features include:
</p><ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-213"><li><strong>Bring It Home:</strong> This added feature is a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter’s main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts:  the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the intro module) and the second at chapter’s end, when students have learned what’s necessary to understand the case and “bring home” the chapter’s core concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Work It Out:</strong> This added feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them step by step to find out how its solution is derived. </li>
<li><strong>Clear It Up:</strong> This boxed feature, which includes pre-existing features from Taylor’s text, addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts with a question.  The rest of the feature explains the answer.</li>
<li><strong>Link It Up:</strong> This added feature is a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students’ understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.  </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-651"><h4 data-type="title">Questions for each level of learning</h4><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-454">The OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> further expands on Taylor’s original end of chapter materials by offering four types of end of module questions for students:
</p><ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-284"><li><strong>Self-Checks</strong> are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They “click to reveal” an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think beyond what is said in the text.  Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through the problem.  </li>
<li><strong>Review Questions</strong> have been retained from Taylor’s version, and are simple recall questions from the chapter in open-response format (not multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text. </li>
<li><strong>Critical Thinking Questions</strong> are new higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to <em data-effect="italics">demonstrate their understanding by applying</em> what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for outside-the-box thinking, for <em data-effect="italics">reasoning</em> about the concepts. They push the student to places they wouldn’t have thought of going themselves.  </li>
<li><strong>Problems</strong> are exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and computational concepts in the module. </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-780"><h4 data-type="title">Updated art</h4><p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-26"><em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> includes an updated art program to better inform today’s student, providing the latest data on covered topics.

the importance of education and the role that literacy would play in realizing their dreams of freedom and opportunity. When Cheyney University, the nation’s first Historically Black College and University, was founded in the early 19th century, the ability to read and write printed texts was the goal of gaining literacy. Now, reading and writing provide the foundation for multiple literacies in various professional fields, social contexts, and both print and electronic media (Credit: N. Giovannucci).</figcaption>

<p id="auto_f4d4370c-dc05-4cb0-8dd1-be7b77359505_first">One path to learning the language of any institution of higher learning, also known as the <span data-type="term">academy</span>, is what professors like to call “entering the academic discourse community.” This phrase means that you to begin to reflect on the experiences that have laid the path for your admission to this new community. In the traditional sense, when talking about <span data-type="term">literacy</span>, people typically think of reading and writing. However, in the modern multimedia and kinesthetic world, the definition of <em data-effect="italics">literacy</em> has been expanded to mean "competence in communication," including a multitude of methods, modes, and texts. People are considered literate in almost any concentrated area in which they demonstrate knowledge.
  </p><p id="auto_f4d4370c-dc05-4cb0-8dd1-be7b77359505_eip-977">Having a broad understanding of literacy allows individuals to think about the <span data-type="term">genre</span> (writing type) of the <span data-type="term">literacy narrative</span> in many ways: ways that are textual, musical, digital, social, communal—the list continues. What we know for certain is that literacy involves individual as well as community engagement. One does not achieve literacy through isolation but also as a result of active engagement among members within communities.</p><p id="auto_f4d4370c-dc05-4cb0-8dd1-be7b77359505_eip-407">The literacy narrative is a genre that provides an account of individuals or members of a community and their experiences with learning. Combining the broad definition of <em data-effect="italics">literacy</em> with the term <em data-effect="italics">narrative</em>, or "storytelling," produces the literacy narrative: a story that provides an account of a learning experience. As you begin to reflect on what it means to learn, this chapter will guide you through an exploration of the various features of the literacy narrative genre to prepare you to write one of your own.</p>

The language you use also signals the ways you are rooted in specific <span data-type="term">cultures</span> (groups of people who share common beliefs and lived experiences). Because the ways in which people speak and write are closely intertwined with their self-images and community affiliations, you can think, communicate, and interact most freely with others by using your personal <span data-type="term">idiolect</span> (your individual way of speaking and writing), which is based in <span data-type="term">cultural</span> language use. This section examines a few myths about language use and explores some productive ways to think about language and communication.

As members of different communities, most people speak and write in a number of English varieties without even thinking about doing so. Like others, you generally speak differently with friends than with elders. You usually use different types of language in texting on phones than when writing professional emails. As you make these communication choices in different settings, you signal your identity and culture through word choice, sentence structure, and understanding of language use in specific situations. For example, when speaking with friends, you may engage in wordplay to show identification with the group. On the other hand, you may speak with respect to elders to show an identity as a well-mannered younger relative, and you may use a standard email format to show a professional identity.

</p><p id="auto_c94c7ae0-0c9f-4249-817b-560d3c686ed5_eip-730">Every time you communicate, you signal some aspect of your identity. In the same way that everyone has multiple, intersecting identities, everyone has multiple ways of expressing themselves through language. As members of a multiethnic, multicultural society, everyone should recognize and respect these personal ways of communicating, which are integral to a shared human experience.</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="auto_c94c7ae0-0c9f-4249-817b-560d3c686ed5_eip-112"><h3 data-type="title">Expressing Identity in Writing</h3><p id="auto_c94c7ae0-0c9f-4249-817b-560d3c686ed5_eip-958" class="annotation linguistic-icon culture-icon">
Even though individuals speak and write effectively by using different varieties of English, many people nevertheless believe that one standard, “proper” English variety exists and that this “correct” way of speaking and writing should be used universally in all settings. This viewpoint considers varieties of English outside the imagined norm to be “wrong,” “bad,” or “substandard.” For example, speakers of some Southern English varieties are often judged as “poor” or “unintelligent.” If you speak and write using one of those undervalued English varieties, others may have judged you for your language use or told you that your writing is “wrong.” Even without such judgement, you may have felt apprehensive when sharing your writing with others; you still may fear a harsh assessment, or you may feel vulnerable when others see your compositions.
</p><p id="auto_c94c7ae0-0c9f-4249-817b-560d3c686ed5_eip-677" class="annotation auditory-icon kinesthetic-icon">The truth is that people speak and write in different ways for different <span data-type="term">rhetorical situations</span> (instances of communication). People in different communities and professions employ distinct kinds of English. You already use different varieties of English in different parts of your life; as you progress through college and into your career, you will learn the language expectations for the rhetorical situations you will encounter in those spaces. In learning these expectations, you will gain new identities. For example, you may become someone who knows how to write an exemplary lab report, you could develop an identity as an emerging researcher in any number of fields, or you simply may become someone who is comfortable letting other people see your writing. These new linguistic identities do not need to replace your language use in other areas of your life. For instance, you should not feel the need to use a different form of grammar or punctuation in your social media posts. You should feel comfortable using your familiar English varieties in familiar rhetorical situations and, if needed, use new varieties of English you may learn in the new rhetorical situations you encounter. Additionally, you can, and should, seek out opportunities to use your familiar, nonacademic English varieties in academic and professional settings when you feel it is appropriate and aligns with the expectations of your instructor or employer.
</p><p id="auto_c94c7ae0-0c9f-4249-817b-560d3c686ed5_eip-61" class="annotation dreaming-icon visual-icon speech-icon">Because people write in many different settings for many reasons, no particular English variety is appropriate for all writing tasks. As you become more familiar with the ways English is used in different settings and communities, you can choose which variety to use. You also may choose whether to meet or to disrupt the expectations of the people you are communicating with. In making these choices, you will rely on your existing literacies as well as newly learned ones.

<p id="auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_fs-idm370565488" class="annotation culture-icon linguistic-icon">In her 2018 best seller, <em data-effect="italics">Educated: A Memoir</em>, Tara Westover considers the effects of academic and nonacademic literacies in her life. She also contemplates the ways that identification with certain literacies can both create and disturb an individual's relationships and community memberships. While <em data-effect="italics">Educated: A Memoir</em> addresses a variety of themes—including the tensions that family members must confront when they disagree—the memoir can be read largely as a literacy narrative, or story about learning literacies.</p><p id="auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-240">Early in the memoir, Westover discusses a range of literacies she developed as the youngest of seven children in a home-schooled family. Although she was taught to read, her literary world consisted almost exclusively of the Mormon Bible and other religious texts. Her other literacies included preserving food, preparing herbs, and caring for the animals on the family farm, located on an Idaho mountain. She felt a keen sense of belonging both to her family and to their mountain home. Westover also learned how to work in, and survive, the dangerous junkyard her family owned and operated. Even though many family members sustained a variety of horrific accidents and injuries over the years—mostly at the junkyard or in car accidents—the family relied entirely on natural remedies; both parents considered doctors and medicine to be sinful. Despite the range of literacies Westover learned at home, her parents did not value formal schooling and were indifferent to developing a broad understanding of science, history, and current events. The Westover children were almost entirely self-directed in their academic studies.
</p><p id="auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-653">When Tara was a young child, she fully embraced her parents’ beliefs that “government schooling” was wholly unchristian and equivalent to brainwashing. Her brother Tyler, however, had always loved “book learning” and decided to leave home to attend college. Even he could not fully articulate why he felt compelled to be the first to leave, but his departure intrigued Tara. She, too, began to think about pursuing higher education. After another brother had become physically abusive toward Tara, Tyler encouraged her to use college as an escape. She then bought an ACT prep book, studied on her own, and did well enough on the exams to be accepted to Brigham Young University. </p><p id="auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-83">She articulates in her memoir that once on campus, she realized how much her haphazard homeschooling experience had left her with large gaps in knowledge and no preparation for studying and taking tests. As she improved her academic skills, she also learned methods of academic inquiry that were at odds with her parents’ faith-based interpretations of both world and personal events.
</p><p id="auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-402">As Westover gained a different worldview through her college experience, she struggled to integrate her new understandings with her family’s perspectives: in other words, her new literacies were at odds with her old ones. She still felt connected to her family, but her new understanding of the world was irreconcilable with her father’s survivalist, fundamentalist beliefs. When she refused to submit to her father’s will and return to his rigid world view and interpretation of Mormonism, Tara Westover’s relationship with most of her family members disintegrated. Instead, she used her academic literacies to examine the history of their religion in her doctoral research. All three Westover children who left the mountain—and to some extent, their family—earned PhDs. The four who stayed near the family home have had little formal education.<a href="#auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-idm252391136" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a>
</p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-idm252391136">This is a footnote.</aside><p id="auto_b8ea2055-f5a8-444d-a114-b4afbd2dfee5_eip-186">For Westover, the schism with her family was not primarily the result of her literacy learning; rather, the relationship ruptured because she refused to repudiate her newfound knowledge as inferior to her family’s ways of knowing. In subsequent interviews, Westover discusses the loss she felt in being cut off from her family and place of origin. Although many college students experience similar challenges integrating new ways of encountering the world with their family’s views of “how things are” or “how things should be,” some families feel enriched by the new information, whereas others feel threatened by it.

These distinctive ways of writing can be referred to, in part, as genres. You may have heard the term genre in reference to publishing categories, such as novels or memoirs, but the term can refer to any type of writing that conforms to specific forms and benchmarks. Many genres include stories of different kinds: for example, folktales, short stories, accounts of events, and biography. As author Jonathan Gottschall says, humankind is “the storytelling animal”; people of all cultures have always engaged in telling stories, both as storytellers and as audience members. Simply put, narrative stories are essential to many genres of writing.</p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594_eip-210"><h3 data-type="title">Exploring Narrative: Elements of Storytelling</h3><p id="auto_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594_eip-245">Narratives, whether about literacy or anything else, include these key elements:
</p><ul id="auto_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594_eip-178"><li><strong>Plot</strong> Authors of narratives tell about one or more events. In fiction, the plot is the sequence of those events. In nonfiction a plot is often referred to simply as the events, but they follow similar plot patterns of an exposition or introduction, series of events leading to a climax or discovery, and events following the climax or discovery.</li><li>
<strong>Characters</strong> The events in the story happen to characters, or individuals who are part of the story. In nonfiction, these characters are usually real people. The audience should feel a connection to the main character or characters. Readers may like or dislike characters, blame them or feel sorry for them, identify with them or not. Skilled writers portray characters through the use of dialogue, actions or behavior, and thoughts so that readers can see for themselves what these individuals are like.</li><li>
<strong>Setting</strong> Stories, fiction and nonfiction, take place in settings, which include locations, time periods, and the cultures in which the characters or real people are immersed.</li><li>
<strong>Problem and Resolution</strong> In narratives, the characters generally encounter one or more problems. The tensions caused by the problem build to a climax. The resolution of the problem and the built-up tensions usually occur near the end of the story.</li><li>
<strong>Story Arc</strong> Most narratives have a story arc—a beginning, a middle, and an end—but not necessarily in that order. The story arc, or order of events, may occur chronologically, or the story may begin in the middle of the action and explain earlier events later in the sequence.</li></ul></section><section data-depth="1" id="auto_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594_eip-820"><h3 data-type="title">Specific Details and Other Conventions</h3><p id="auto_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594_eip-966">To immerse the audience in the story, authors provide specific details of the scenes and action.<a href="#auto_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594_eip-idm238922368" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a> Many authors, and teachers, call this strategy “showing, not telling.” These aspects can include the following elements:

Most important, the audience must feel that the story has some significance. While the author’s main point may only be implied, rather than stated outright as in a conventional academic essay, readers should understand the point of the story and believe that it matters. The following elements, therefore, are crucial for writers of narratives to consider.
</p><ul id="auto_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594_eip-348"><li><strong>Audience</strong> Narratives are designed to appeal to specific audiences; authors choose storytelling elements, details, and language strategies to engage the target audience.
</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong> Authors may tell stories for different reasons: to entertain, reinforce cultural norms, educate, or to strengthen social ties. The same story may, and often does, fulfill more than one purpose.

<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_fs-idm244697456">Very soon after I went to live with Mr. and Mrs. Auld, she very kindly commenced to teach me the A, B, C. After I had learned this, she assisted me in learning to spell words of three or four letters. Just at this point of my progress, Mr. Auld found out what was going on, and at once forbade Mrs. Auld to instruct me further, telling her, among other things, that it was unlawful, as well as unsafe, to teach a slave to read.
</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm252495488" class="annotation-text">Here Douglass describes the background situation and the culture of the time, which he will defy in his quest for literacy. The word choice in his narration of events indicates he is writing for an educated audience.
</p><p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-177">To use his own words, further, he said, "If you give a nigger an inch, he will take an ell. A nigger should know nothing but to obey his master—to do as he is told to do. Learning would spoil the best nigger in the world. Now," said he, "if you teach that nigger (speaking of myself) how to read, there would be no keeping him. It would forever unfit him to be a slave. He would at once become unmanageable, and of no value to his master. As to himself, it could do him no good, but a great deal of harm. It would make him discontented and unhappy."
</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm247588576" class="annotation-text">In sharing this part of the narrative, Douglass underscores the importance of literacy. He provides a description of Mr. Auld, a slaveholder, who seeks to use literacy as a means to oppress others. In this description of Mr. Auld’s reaction, Douglass shows that slaveholders feared the power that enslaved people would have if they could read and write. Douglass provides the details of Auld’s dialogue not only because it is a convention of narrative genre, but also because it demonstrates a purpose for his forthcoming pursuit of literacy. We have chosen to maintain the authenticity of the original text by using the language that Douglass offers to quote Mr. Auld’s dialogue because it both provides context for the rhetorical situation, as well as underscores the value of the attainment of literacy for Douglass. However, contemporary audiences must understand that under no circumstance should this language be uttered in current rhetorical situations. </p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm244726480">These words sank deep into my heart, stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering, and called into existence an entirely new train of thought. It was a new and special revelation, explaining dark and mysterious things, with which my youthful understanding had struggled, but struggled in vain. I now understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty—to wit, the white man's power to enslave the black man. It was a grand achievement, and I prized it highly. From that moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom. It was just what I wanted, and I got it at a time when I the least expected it. Whilst I was saddened by the thought of losing the aid of my kind mistress, I was gladdened by the invaluable instruction which, by the merest accident, I had gained from my master.

<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm245771440">Though conscious of the difficulty of learning without a teacher, I set out with high hope, and a fixed purpose, at whatever cost of trouble, to learn how to read. The very decided manner with which he spoke, and strove to impress his wife with the evil consequences of giving me instruction, served to convince me that he was deeply sensible of the truths he was uttering. It gave me the best assurance that I might rely with the utmost confidence on the results which, he said, would flow from teaching me to read. What he most dreaded, that I most desired. What he most loved, that I most hated. That which to him was a great evil, to be carefully shunned, was to me a great good, to be diligently sought; and the argument which he so warmly urged, against my learning to read, only served to inspire me with a desire and determination to learn. In learning to read, I owe almost as much to the bitter opposition of my master, as to the kindly aid of my mistress. I acknowledge the benefit of both.
</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm241361792" class="annotation-text">Douglass articulates that this moment changes his relationship to literacy and ignites a purposeful engagement with language and learning that would last throughout his long life. The rhythm, sentence structure, and poetic phrasing in this reflection provide further evidence that Douglass does actively pursue and master language after having this experience with Mr. Auld.</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm246872752">[<em data-effect="italics">excerpt continues with the beginning of Chapter 7 on page 36 and ends with the end of the paragraph at the top of page 39</em>]</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm249285232">  [In Chapter 7, the narrative continues] I lived in Master Hugh's family about seven years. During this time, I succeeded in learning to read and write. In accomplishing this, I was compelled to resort to various stratagems. I had no regular teacher. My mistress, who had kindly commenced to instruct me, had, in compliance with the advice and direction of her husband, not only ceased to instruct, but had set her face against my being instructed by any one else. It is due, however, to my mistress to say of her, that she did not adopt this course of treatment immediately. She at first lacked the depravity indispensable to shutting me up in mental darkness. It was at least necessary for her to have some training in the exercise of irresponsible power, to make her equal to the task of treating me as though I were a brute.
</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm247149776" class="annotation-text">Douglass describes in detail a person in his life and his relationship to her. He uses examples of her kindness—a tear for the suffering, bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked and comfort for the mourner.</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm246833520"> My mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced, when I first went to live with her, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another. In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but dangerously so. Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me. When I went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman. There was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear. She had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities. Under its influence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness. The first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me. She now commenced to practise her husband's precepts. She finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself. </p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm244715024" class="annotation-text">The fact that Douglass can understand the harm of the institution of slavery on enslaved people as well as on slaveholders shows a level of sophistication in thought, identifies the complexity and detriment of this historical period, and demonstrates an acute awareness of the rhetorical situation, especially on his audience for this text. The way that he articulates compassion for the slaveholders, despite their ill treatment of him, would create empathy in his readers and have a transformative impact on his audience.
</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm246236880" class="public-domain">She was not satisfied with simply doing as well as he had commanded; she seemed anxious to do better. Nothing seemed to make her more angry than to see me with a newspaper. She seemed to think that here lay the danger. I have had her rush at me with a face made all up of fury, and snatch from me a newspaper, in a manner that fully revealed her apprehension. She was an apt woman; and a little experience soon demonstrated, to her satisfaction, that education and slavery were incompatible with each other.</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm253167984" class="annotation-text">Once again, Douglass underscores the value that literacy has on transforming the lived experiences of enslaved people.</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm242186640">From this time I was most narrowly watched. If I was in a separate room any considerable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of having a book, and was at once called to give an account of myself. All this, however, was too late. The first step had been taken. Mistress, in teaching me the alphabet, had given me the <em data-effect="italics">inch</em>, and no precaution could prevent me from taking the <em data-effect="italics">ell</em>.</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm242254848" class="annotation-text">The reference to the <em data-effect="italics">inch</em> and the <em data-effect="italics">ell</em> recalls Mr. Auld's warnings.</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm248458736">The plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most successful, was that of making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in the street. As many of these as I could, I converted into teachers. With their kindly aid, obtained at different times and in different places, I finally succeeded in learning to read. When I was sent of errands, I always took my book with me, and by going one part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return. I used also to carry bread with me, enough of which was always in the house, and to which I was always welcome; for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood. This bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge. I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence forbids;—not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian country.
</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm255728256" class="annotation-text">Douglass comments on the culture of the time, which still permitted slavery; he is sensitive to the fact that these boys might be embarrassed by their participation in unacceptable, though humanitarian, behavior. His tone, too, seems sarcastic when he writes that it is an "unpardonable offense to teach slaves … in this Christian country." Such behavior is surely "unchristian."</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm247626400">It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that they lived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard. I used to talk this matter of slavery over with them. I would sometimes say to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got to be men. "You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, <em data-effect="italics">but I am a slave for life</em>! Have not I as good a right to be free as you have?" These words used to trouble them; they would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope that something would occur by which I might be free.</p>
<p id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm387517920" class="annotation-text">Douglass pursues and attains literacy not only for his own benefit but his knowledge also allows him to begin to instruct, as well as advocate for, those around him. Douglass's use of language and understanding of the rhetorical situation give the audience evidence of the power of literacy for all people, round out the arc of his narrative, and provide a resolution.</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-989"><h3 data-type="title">Discussion Questions</h3><ol id="auto_eaa09a0f-d683-44cd-870b-4205ee0ff23b_eip-idm381020656" type="1"><li> Based on what you have learned about literacy thus far, would you consider this excerpt from Frederick Douglass’s autobiography a literacy narrative?

  <p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-621">Many inexperienced writers imagine that “good” writers compose their texts all at once from beginning to end and need only a small amount of attention to polish the grammar and punctuation before arriving at a final draft. In reality, however, the <span data-type="term">writing process</span> (steps for creating a finished composition) is typically <span data-type="term">recursive</span>. That is, it repeats steps multiple times, not necessarily in the same order, and the process is more messy than linear or systematic. You can think of the writing process in these broad categories:
</p><ul id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-536"><li><strong>Prewriting</strong> You will end up with a stronger composition if you do some work before you begin writing. Before putting words on a page, take some time to think about the rhetorical situation for your writing, gather your thoughts, and consider how you might arrange your ideas.</li><li>
<strong>Drafting</strong> In the past, you may have dedicated most of your writing time to drafting, or putting words into a document. When you have strong prewriting and revision habits, however, drafting is often a smaller portion of the writing process. </li><li>
<strong>Peer Review</strong> Almost all strong writers rely on feedback from others, whether peers, instructors, or editors. Your instructor may guide you in some peer review exercises to complete with your classmates, or you might choose to consult with your university’s writing center. When others give you clear, honest feedback on your draft, you can use that information to strengthen your piece.</li><li>
<strong>Revision</strong> After you have a draft, carefully consider how to make it more effective in reaching the audience and fulfilling its purpose. You can make changes that affect the piece as a whole; such changes are often called global revisions. Conversely, you can make changes that affect only the meaning of a sentence or word; these changes can be called local revisions.</li></ul><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-76">Now that you have reviewed elements of the writing process, place the different tasks within the appropriate writing process category. Because writing is recursive, some tasks may fit into more than one category.</p>

In this assignment, you will write an essay in which you offer a developed <strong>narrative</strong> about an aspect of your <strong>literacy</strong> practice or experience. Consider some of these questions: <em data-effect="italics"> When did this engagement occur? Where were you? Were there other participants? Have you told this story before?

As an alternative, develop a set of interview questions with the members in your composition course community that will allow you to learn more about their past and present experiences with literacy. After the composition course community has determined what the interview questions will be, choose a partner from the composition community to work with on this assignment. Using interview questions you have discussed and developed, conduct an interview with your partner. Your instructor will allow you and your peers to record and transcribe one another’s responses and post them where all students in the community have access. After you have completed, transcribed, and posted your interviews, everyone will closely examine each of their peer’s interviews and look for recurring themes, as well as particularly unique aspects, of the narratives shared. This assignment will inevitably illuminate the communal nature, as well as the unique, independent experiences of literacy engagement.

Now that you have planned your Literacy Narrative, you are ready to begin drafting. If you have been thoughtful in preparing to write, drafting usually proceeds quickly and smoothly. Use your notes to guide you in composing the first draft. As you write about specific events and scenes, create a rich picture for your reader by using concrete, sensory details and specific rather than general nouns.

As Douglass does, create your Literacy Narrative from your recollections of people, places, events, and events. Reread the following passage.
</p>
<p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm243480016" class="public-domain">The plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most successful, was that of making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in the street. As many of these as I could, I converted into teachers. With their kindly aid, obtained at different times and in different places, I finally succeeded in learning to read. When I was sent of errands, I always took my book with me, and by going one part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return. I used also to carry bread with me, enough of which was always in the house, and to which I was always welcome; for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood. This bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge. I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence forbids;—not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian country. It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that they lived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard. I used to talk this matter of slavery over with them. I would sometimes say to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got to be men. "You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, <em data-effect="italics">but I am a slave for life</em>! Have not I as good a right to be free as you have?" These words used to trouble them; they would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope that something would occur by which I might be free.</p><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-985">In this selection from the <em data-effect="italics">Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</em>, elements of the Literacy Narrative genre as explained in <a href="#page_94380e42-ff23-4aee-86cc-34f0cb47b594">Glance at Genre: The Literacy Narrative</a> are evident. First, Douglass introduces additional characters who help him resolve his earlier complication of being prevented from learning to read by the Aulds. The interaction he records here reiterates the larger conflict of the narrative: Douglass’s continuing enslavement. Although he does not give many scenic details, few more would be needed, for he places the action on the street near a shipyard, thereby giving an indication of the surroundings. Douglass presents his own words in dialogue to reinforce for readers that he knows how to speak and write in the ways that white people with means were taught at the time. In this piece, set against the backdrop of a culture that insisted on viewing enslaved people as “brutes,” Douglass demonstrates his dignity by displaying his facility with language and his humanity by offering bread to hungry children who had more freedom and opportunity, but less food, than he does. </p><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-47">To create a draft that draws on multiple elements of storytelling, as this selection from Douglass does, you may need to generate ideas for additional scenes, or you may need to revisit a particular place so that you can provide concrete and sensory details for your readers. To visualize these additional scenes, try storyboarding.

The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me. I am filled with wonder when I consider the immeasurable contrasts between the two lives which it connects. It was the third of March, 1887, three months before I was seven years old.</p><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm249186624" class="public-domain">
On the afternoon of that eventful day, I stood on the porch, dumb, expectant. I guessed vaguely from my mother's signs and from the hurrying to and fro in the house that something unusual was about to happen, so I went to the door and waited on the steps. The afternoon sun penetrated the mass of honeysuckle that covered the porch, and fell on my upturned face. My fingers lingered almost unconsciously on the familiar leaves and blossoms which had just come forth to greet the sweet southern spring. I did not know what the future held of marvel or surprise for me. Anger and bitterness had preyed upon me continually for weeks and a deep languor had succeeded this passionate struggle.</p><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm245159520" class="public-domain">
Have you ever been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in, and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding-line, and you waited with beating heart for something to happen? I was like that ship before my education began, only I was without compass or sounding-line, and had no way of knowing how near the harbour was. "Light! give me light!" was the wordless cry of my soul, and the light of love shone on me in that very hour.</p><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm249135088" class="public-domain">
I felt approaching footsteps, I stretched out my hand as I supposed to my mother. Some one took it, and I was caught up and held close in the arms of her who had come to reveal all things to me, and, more than all things else, to love me.</p><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm247044816" class="public-domain">
The morning after my teacher came she led me into her room and gave me a doll. The little blind children at the Perkins Institution had sent it and Laura Bridgman had dressed it; but I did not know this until afterward. When I had played with it a little while, Miss Sullivan slowly spelled into my hand the word "d-o-l-l." I was at once interested in this finger play and tried to imitate it. When I finally succeeded in making the letters correctly I was flushed with childish pleasure and pride. Running downstairs to my mother I held up my hand and made the letters for doll. I did not know that I was spelling a word or even that words existed; I was simply making my fingers go in monkey-like imitation. In the days that followed I learned to spell in this uncomprehending way a great many words, among them pin, hat, cup and a few verbs like sit, stand and walk. But my teacher had been with me several weeks before I understood that everything has a name.</p><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm245159008" class="public-domain">
One day, while I was playing with my new doll, Miss Sullivan put my big rag doll into my lap also, spelled "d-o-l-l" and tried to make me understand that "d-o-l-l" applied to both. Earlier in the day we had had a tussle over the words "m-u-g" and "w-a-t-e-r." Miss Sullivan had tried to impress it upon me that "m-u-g" is mug and that "w-a-t-e-r" is water, but I persisted in confounding the two. In despair she had dropped the subject for the time, only to renew it at the first opportunity. I became impatient at her repeated attempts and, seizing the new doll, I dashed it upon the floor. I was keenly delighted when I felt the fragments of the broken doll at my feet. Neither sorrow nor regret followed my passionate outburst. I had not loved the doll. In the still, dark world in which I lived there was no strong sentiment or tenderness. I felt my teacher sweep the fragments to one side of the hearth, and I had a sense of satisfaction that the cause of my discomfort was removed. She brought me my hat, and I knew I was going out into the warm sunshine. This thought, if a wordless sensation may be called a thought, made me hop and skip with pleasure.</p><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm245156208" class="public-domain">
We walked down the path to the well-house, attracted by the fragrance of the honeysuckle with which it was covered. Some one was drawing water and my teacher placed my hand under the spout. As the cool stream gushed over one hand she spelled into the other the word water, first slowly, then rapidly. I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motions of her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten—a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me. I knew then that "w-a-t-e-r" meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living word awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free!

I left the well-house eager to learn. Everything had a name, and each name gave birth to a new thought. As we returned to the house every object which I touched seemed to quiver with life. That was because I saw everything with the strange, new sight that had come to me. On entering the door I remembered the doll I had broken. I felt my way to the hearth and picked up the pieces. I tried vainly to put them together. Then my eyes filled with tears; for I realized what I had done, and for the first time I felt repentance and sorrow.</p><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-idm241383424" class="public-domain">
I learned a great many new words that day. I do not remember what they all were; but I do know that mother, father, sister, teacher were among them—words that were to make the world blossom for me, "like Aaron's rod, with flowers." It would have been difficult to find a happier child than I was as I lay in my crib at the close of that eventful day and lived over the joys it had brought me, and for the first time longed for a new day to come.

Both use figurative language—"bread of knowledge"—and make allusions to Christianity. However, Douglass uses dialogue to illustrate a social disparity, whereas Keller's transformation and her language are largely internal. Make use of the strategies that best fit your own literacy narrative.</p><table id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-471" summary="."><thead>  <tr>

 Although the writing process does not always occur in a prescribed sequence (you can sometimes move between steps of the process in a variety of ways), participating in peer review is a necessary, and often critical, part of the writing process. Having the response and feedback of an outside reader can help you shape your writing into work that makes you proud. A peer review occurs when someone at your level (a peer) offers an evaluation of your writing. Instructors aid in this process by giving you and your peers judgment criteria and guidelines to follow, and the feedback of the reader should help you revise your writing before your instructor evaluates it and offers a grade.
</p><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-881">When given the opportunity to engage in a peer review activity, use the following steps to provide your peers with effective, evidence-based feedback for their writing. </p><ul id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-841"><li>Review all the criteria and guidelines for the assignment.</li>
<li>Read the writing all the way through carefully before offering any feedback.</li>
<li>Read the peer review exercise, tool, or instrument provided by the instructor. </li>
<li>Apply and complete the peer review exercise while rereading the work. </li>
<li>Provide feedback to your peer. Your comments should focus on these questions: <em data-effect="italics">In what ways are the organization and coherence of the narrative logical and clear so that you can follow events?  What, if anything, do you not understand or need further explanation about? What do you want to know more about? </em></li></ul><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-347">Following these steps will give your reading the necessary context and situate your feedback within the criteria and guidelines of the assignment. This process will be critical to the revision process for your peer. In addition, reading and evaluating the work of another, and using the criteria and guidelines for that assignment, will strengthen your writing skills and help you when you revise your own work. </p><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-655">Before you can engage in a successful peer review exercise, you must develop a first draft and carefully read it to determine whether you need to make any of these changes. </p><ul id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-869"><li>On a global level, do you need to insert material, delete tangents, or rearrange some sections?

Imagine the opening paragraph with the following sentence: "I have always had a hard time reading music."

Such a brief and limited assessment might lead your partner to suggest in Column 3 that you strengthen your identity by answering the following questions: </p><ul id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-520"><li>When and why did you begin trying to learn to read music?</li>

</li></ul><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-751">During the discussion after the written peer review, you might share the details of your learning to play the piano: that you were five years old and that your grandmother was your teacher. Your revision for this opening paragraph might then include a sentence like the following: "I have been struggling to read music since I began playing piano at five years old, when my grandmother, our church musician, gave me my first lesson." This process demonstrates the way in which the peer review should lead to substantive change and revision in your writing. </p><p id="auto_bd84c07f-d9d2-41b2-b783-16a72bd1c6d5_eip-567">You will want to read and discuss the details of the evidence (Column 2) and suggestions (Column 3) for each of the above criteria (Column 1) with your peer review partner. On the basis of your partner’s assessment—and your own judgment, of course—make any necessary revisions before submitting your literacy narrative for grading. The more time you take to go through this process, the more developed and comprehensive your writing will be. Some people may feel anxious about having others read their work, but the scenario provided above demonstrates the valuable ways that a preliminary reading audience can help improve the narrative.</p></section>

  <p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-686">After writing a draft of your Literacy Narrative and revising it to strengthen the overall shape and content of the text, you are ready to pay closer attention to individual sentences within it. This section offers several strategies for improving your sentences to communicate meaning more effectively to your audience and to make the reading experience more engaging. </p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-67"><h3 data-type="title">Sentence Combining</h3><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-94">
<span data-type="term">Sentence combining</span> is an often-used revision strategy that can completely transform a narrative. When writers compose early drafts with many short sentences rather than more sophisticated efforts at varied or complex sentence construction, writing appears choppy and disjointed. Once you have a complete draft of your essay, consider combining sentences that provide your audience with more effective and nuanced ways of reading your work. You can combine short, choppy, repetitive sentences into a simple sentence with a compound verb or subject, as in the first example below. Or you can combine the shorter sentences into a complex sentence with a dependent clause, as in the second example.
</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-798">1a. I learned to play piano. I was five years old. Learning to play piano is my literacy experience. Memorizing the location of the keys is also my literacy experience. <span data-type="newline"><br/></span>
          1b. Learning to play piano at the age of five and memorizing the location of the keys are my literacy experiences.<span data-type="newline"><br/></span>
            2a. I learned to read in first grade. Learning to read made me want to be a teacher. I want to share my experience with reading with future first graders.<span data-type="newline"><br/></span>
2b. Learning to read as a first grader made me want to become a teacher so that I could share my experiences with future first graders.
</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-92">Read through the draft of your essay, and look for sentences that are closely related enough that they can be combined for richer meaning. However, keep in mind that short sentences are effective in your writing, especially when you want to create realistic dialogue or show action. Look to create a balance among sentence length and types to engage your audience. Remember, too, that the best test of whether words are pulling their own weight and providing rhythm, balance, and emphasis is to read the passage out loud.

If you have often been told to make your sentences clearer, less wordy, or both, but you do not know where to start, this section offers some quick strategies to address some of the most common issues that contribute to unclear or wordy writing.

</p><section data-depth="2" id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-490"><h4 data-type="title">Defining "You" and "This"</h4><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-471">
One common pattern that makes writing less clear is the use of you to mean “a random person” rather than “you,” the audience. Here is an example, followed by a revision.
</p>
<p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-idm254962176"> 1a. You must plan your document carefully to connect with your audience.<span data-type="newline"><br/></span>
1b. <u data-effect="underline">Writers</u> must plan their documents carefully to connect with their audiences.
</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-50">This sentence is stronger with the revision clearly indicating who needs to plan their writing. You might be writing a piece addressed directly to the audience, as this text is. If so, be careful to distinguish between the use of you to mean your specific audience—appropriate when directly addressing an audience—and a hazier use of you that needs clarification. Use the “find” function to search your document for the word <em data-effect="italics">you</em>, and then replace every unclear you with a definite noun.
</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-745">Another pattern affecting the clarity of written work is using the word <em data-effect="italics">this</em> on its own without an explanation of what “this” is. Here is an example, along with its revision:</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-675">1a. This can be confusing to the reader.<span data-type="newline"><br/></span>
1b. This <u data-effect="underline">lack of explanation</u> can be confusing to the reader.</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-927">In the first sentence, the audience wonders, “This what?” In the second sentence, the writer simply adds a noun phrase to explain, and readers will appreciate the clarification. Use the “find” function to search your document for <em data-effect="italics">this</em>, and make sure you have defined or explained this in all cases.</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-101"><h4 data-type="title">Revising Sentences to Change "There are/there is" or "It is"</h4><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-991">
Readers relate better to sentences that feature a “doer”—someone or something performing an action—and an “action”—the activity of the doer. For this reason, writing that overuses the sentence patterns of “There are …/there is …” and “It is …” in place of a doer and action can seem unclear, remote, or dull for the reader. As you revise such sentences, you may find at times that you need to insert a doer or an action; one or both may be missing from the first version of the sentence. Here is one example, with a suggested revision.
</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-716">1a. There are many ways to revise written work. <span data-type="newline"><br/></span>
1b. Authors have many ways to revise written work.</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-304">In the first sentence, the "author" is implied, but the second sentence includes a doer for a more reader-friendly version.</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-405">Sentences using the <em data-effect="italics">it is</em> pattern need similar attention to present a doer and an action to the reader. Here is one example and revision.</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-918">1a. It is challenging but rewarding to revise a composition.<span data-type="newline"><br/></span>
   1b. I feel challenged but rewarded when revising a composition.</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-924">Again, the first sentence needs an agent to do the sentence’s actions. Use the “find” function to search your document for “there are,” “there is,” and “it is,” and replace these weaker sentence constructions with doers and actions wherever possible.</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-839"><h4 data-type="title">Eliminating Wordiness.</h4><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-645">
To begin, look at the sentences below to get a sense of what wordiness is. Wordiness does not change or omit information, although it can. In these sentences, though, the information remains the same, but the edited sentence shows a trimmed down version. <em data-effect="italics">There was</em> and <em data-effect="italics">that</em> are eliminated, as is the unnecessary adverb <em data-effect="italics">really</em>, and the phrase <em data-effect="italics">waves in the ocean</em> becomes <em data-effect="italics">ocean waves</em>.
</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-82">1a.  There was a really bright light that was shining on the waves in the ocean.<span data-type="newline"><br/></span>
                1b.  A bright light was shining on the ocean waves.</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-318">In general, try to cut out words that do not add meaning, rhythm, or emphasis. Sentences clogged with unnecessary words cause readers to lose interest, patience, and comprehension. Editing sentences for concrete nouns, action verbs, and well-chosen modifiers will help you weed out unnecessary words. Writing varied and emphatic sentences helps with this task too. Look at the following sentences, which all say essentially the same thing. However, you will see some changes and omissions.</p><ul id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-252"><li>In almost every situation that I can think of, except with few exceptions, it will make
good sense for you to look for as many places as possible to cut out needless,
redundant, and repetitive words from the papers and reports, paragraphs and
sentences you write for college assignments. (49 words)</li><li>
In most situations it makes good sense to cut out needless words from your
college papers. (16 words)</li><li>
Whenever possible, omit needless words from your writing. (8 words)
Omit needless words. (3 words)
</li></ul><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-652">The 49-word sentence is full of early-draft language; you can almost visualize the writer finding their way while writing. The 16-word sentence says much the same thing, with far fewer words. Most of this editing simply cut out unnecessary words. Only at the end were several wordy phrases condensed: "from the papers and reports, paragraphs and sentences you write for college assignments" was reduced to "from your college papers." That 16-word sentence was reduced in half by rephrasing and dropping the emphasis on college writing. And that sentence was whittled down by nearly two-thirds, to arrive at the core three-word sentence, "Omit needless words."
</p><p id="auto_1efacd7e-e892-48c7-8f7f-6230a7d5df7d_eip-687">The first sentence is long-winded by any standard or in any context; each of the next
three might serve well in different situations. Thus, when you edit to make language more
concise, think about the overall effect you intend to create. Sometimes the briefest construction is not the best one for your purpose. For example, the three-word sentence is more suited to a brief list than to a sentence of advice for this book.

A portfolio is a collection of your work, gathered in a single place, for the purpose of assessing your growth and achievement as a writer. A portfolio allows you not only to include writing artifacts but also to reflect on the process of composing those artifacts. In this section, you will have an opportunity to compose a reflection on the process of writing your literacy narrative.</p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_33fcf59e-e164-4049-98a1-54b66c61acaf_eip-265"><h3 data-type="title">Reflection Prompt</h3><p id="auto_33fcf59e-e164-4049-98a1-54b66c61acaf_eip-909">
One of the most valuable writing exercises is to reflect on work that you have completed or experiences that you have had. Reflection supports learning by allowing writers to articulate the impact that experiences have had on various aspects of their lives. In this section, take some time to reflect on your experiences, as well as the experiences of others, with literacy and learning. Using the guidelines your instructor provides, compose a reflection that responds to the following questions:
</p><ul id="auto_33fcf59e-e164-4049-98a1-54b66c61acaf_eip-524"><li>Has the opportunity to reflect on your engagement with literacy practices, the practices of those in your composition course community, or the practices of people beyond your immediate community, affected your understanding of literacies?</li><li>
How will this experience and reflection affect future engagement?

Submitting the best version of your work is an important part of preparing a portfolio.  After you have received a graded essay with comments from your instructor, use those comments as a source to revise the essay for a final time.

<p id="auto_8ee388fa-11c7-4b23-8e8e-c6f28ecf7b95_para-00001">Chances are you already have a great deal of experience with <span data-type="term" id="auto_8ee388fa-11c7-4b23-8e8e-c6f28ecf7b95_term-00001">multimodal</span> composition—that is, writing or creating content by combining different types of communication. Much of your experience may come from digital spaces, perhaps even from platforms such as social media that you don’t associate with academics. According to literature examining adolescent and young adult literacy skills, young adults incorporate a great deal of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_8ee388fa-11c7-4b23-8e8e-c6f28ecf7b95_term-00002">multimodal communication</span>—which includes sound, images, movement, and text—into their everyday lives to express themselves and connect with others. Social media has no doubt hastened the spread of multimodal communication, and its prevalence in the world is unprecedented. Perhaps you have never believed that your experience with digital and multimodal writing connects to academic composition, but indeed it does. Just as technology has changed how people interact with the world, multimodal composition has altered how they create content. In this chapter, you will learn how to combine your experience in creating and using multimodal composition with established writing practices, particularly those used in argumentative writing, to generate connected content that creates meaning.</p>

<p id="auto_8ee388fa-11c7-4b23-8e8e-c6f28ecf7b95_para-00002">Multimodal composition begins where any other composition does: with the <span data-type="term" id="auto_8ee388fa-11c7-4b23-8e8e-c6f28ecf7b95_term-00003">rhetorical situation</span>, or the circumstance of communication in which one person (the composer) uses communication to influence the perspective of another (the audience). All multimodal compositions are created for a specific time and place and a particular audience who views the world in an explicit and culturally influenced way. As a writer, you make choices based on the rhetorical situation: context, audience, purpose, genre, and culture. You consider the strengths and weaknesses of all the possible means and tools available for reaching your rhetorical goals. By identifying the audience, determining what you need to tell the audience, and analyzing the best way to do that (including which types of media to use), you are empowered to create an effective and targeted composition.</p>

<p id="auto_8ee388fa-11c7-4b23-8e8e-c6f28ecf7b95_para-00003">In many ways, multimodal composition opens a range of possibilities by offering you any number of tools to make meaning, rather than limiting you to text alone. For example, a sportswriter might rely heavily on visuals to engage readers and demonstrate a runner’s prowess, or they might create infographics to relay statistics about the athlete or the meet itself.</p>

<figure id="auto_8ee388fa-11c7-4b23-8e8e-c6f28ecf7b95_fig-00002"><figcaption>Composers often use images to engage readers and relate details that are difficult to express with words alone.

</figure>

<p id="auto_8ee388fa-11c7-4b23-8e8e-c6f28ecf7b95_para-00004">Websites require a balance of text, images, and careful formatting to present information in ways that are easy to digest and not overwhelming for the reader. In fact, the most difficult part of this type of creation may be choosing among the available tools to create meaning <em data-effect="italics">effectively</em> without doing too much or too little. In some ways, the flexibility of websites can make it hard to know where to get started—or where to end.</p>

<p id="auto_8ee388fa-11c7-4b23-8e8e-c6f28ecf7b95_para-00005">This chapter presents a blog post by Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, formerly of the Environmental Protection Agency. Studying this article and the components of multimodal writing that Dunn chooses to use will help you understand how different platforms and rhetorical needs require different elements of text, media, and modes. Later in the chapter, you will learn how to address a range of audiences through your own textual and digital compositions.</p>

A <span data-type="term" id="auto_dd846890-31d7-4ccc-83a2-bab6b263d93c_term-00001">genre</span> is a type of composition that encompasses defined features, follows a style or format, and reflects your purpose as a writer. For example, given the composition types <em data-effect="italics">romantic comedy</em>, <em data-effect="italics">poetry</em>, or <em data-effect="italics">documentary</em>, you probably can think easily of features of each of these composition types. When considering the multimodal genres, you will discover that genres create <span data-type="term" id="auto_dd846890-31d7-4ccc-83a2-bab6b263d93c_term-00002">conventions</span> (standard ways of doing things) for categorizing media according to the expectations of the audience and the way the media will be consumed. Consider film media, for example; it encompasses genres including drama, documentaries, and animated shorts, to name a few. Each genre has its own conventions, or features. When you write or analyze multimodal texts, it is important to account for genre conventions.</p>

<p id="auto_dd846890-31d7-4ccc-83a2-bab6b263d93c_para-00005">Multimodal composition provides an opportunity for you to develop and practice skills that will translate to future coursework and career opportunities. Creating a multimodal text requires you to demonstrate aptitude in various modes and reflects the requirements for communication skills beyond the academic world. In other words, although multimodal creations may seem to be little more than pictures and captions at times, they must be carefully constructed to be effective. Even the simplest compositions are meticulously planned and executed. Multimodal compositions may include written text, such as blog post text, slideshow text, and website content; image-based content, such as infographics and photo essays; or audiovisual content, including podcasts, public service announcements, and videos.</p>

<p class="annotation culture-icon" id="auto_dd846890-31d7-4ccc-83a2-bab6b263d93c_para-00006">Multimodal composition is especially important in a 21st-century world where communication must represent and transfer across cultural contexts. Because using multiple modes helps a writer make meaning in different <span data-type="term" id="auto_dd846890-31d7-4ccc-83a2-bab6b263d93c_term-00009">channels</span> (media that communicate a message), the availability of different modes is especially important to help you make yourself understood as an author. In academic settings, multimodal content creation increases engagement, improves equity, and helps prepare you to be a global citizen. The same is true for your readers. Multimodal composition is important in addressing and supporting cultural and linguistic diversity. Modes are shaped by social, cultural, and historic factors, all of which influence their use and impact in communication. And it isn’t just readers who benefit from multimodal composition. Combining a variety of modes allows you as a composer to connect to your own lived experiences—the representation of experiences and choices that you have faced in your own life—and helps you develop a unique voice, thus leveraging your knowledge and experiences.</p>

Bolatagici was born in Tasmania and, as a young person, spent time living in Hobart, Tasmania; Sydney, Australia; and her father’s village of Suvavou, Fiji. Her work has been featured across the globe, including in exhibits in the United States, Taiwan, and Mexico as well as throughout New Zealand and Australia. She has a PhD from the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_2c3e68b1-188b-48c0-86b9-29e528a400e7_term-00002">School of Art and Design, University of New South Wales</span>, where she wrote her dissertation on “Somatic Sotia: Commodity, Agency and the Fijian Military Body.”</p>
<p id="auto_2c3e68b1-188b-48c0-86b9-29e528a400e7_para-00005">In 2013 and 2014, Bolatagici coordinated the <a href="https://openstax.org/r/contemporary_specific">Contemporary Pacific Arts Festival</a>, curating an experience that focused on Pacific arts practices in Australia. She invited speakers to present on themes spanning activism and the arts, cultural appropriation, and contemporary artistic practices. Bolatagici now works as an educator, lecturing on art and performance at <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_2c3e68b1-188b-48c0-86b9-29e528a400e7_term-00003">Deakin University</span> in Australia, and has led youth arts workshops in the local Pacific community.</p>
<p id="auto_2c3e68b1-188b-48c0-86b9-29e528a400e7_para-00006">Reflecting on the beginnings of her career, she describes going through her undergraduate coursework and feeling the responsibility of bringing “brown-ness” to the classroom. After finding that higher education largely dismissed the lived experiences of marginalized communities and spending time at the Stuart Hall Library at the Institute of International Visual Arts, Bolatagici was inspired to create the pop-up <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_2c3e68b1-188b-48c0-86b9-29e528a400e7_term-00004">Community Reading Room in Melbourne, Australia</span>, in 2013.</p>
<p id="auto_2c3e68b1-188b-48c0-86b9-29e528a400e7_para-00007">Through the pop-up room, she hoped to engage the community in international visual arts and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_2c3e68b1-188b-48c0-86b9-29e528a400e7_term-00005">culture</span>. She began her initiative by sharing her own personal collection, including texts and anthologies of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) art. The Community Reading Room provides an emphasis on contemporary art and theory from Africa, the Americas, and Oceania.</p>
<p id="auto_2c3e68b1-188b-48c0-86b9-29e528a400e7_para-00008">Bolatagici has incorporated a <a href="https://openstax.org/r/variety">variety of media</a> into her academic and professional portfolios, describing how her work helps her not only <a href="https://openstax.org/r/represent">represent diverse cultures</a> but also explore her own identity. From <a href="https://openstax.org/r/photo_essays">photo essays</a> to academic papers, her compositions are anchored by the common thread of representing marginalized people and experiences, particularly those related to communities of color. Her creative output has focused on representation of mixed-race identity, Pacific arts practices, and militarism. Through mixed media, she investigates relationships between visual culture and historiography (study of historical writings); human ecology (study of relationships between humans and their natural, social, and created environments); and the intersection of gender, knowledge, and globalization.</p>
<p id="auto_2c3e68b1-188b-48c0-86b9-29e528a400e7_para-00009">Bolatagici describes her work as interdisciplinary, creating components across a wide range of media. Instead of limiting herself, she allows her work to flow naturally, staying focused in the moment. With these unique components, she looks at the relationship between visual culture and human ecology. This interdisciplinary approached emerged for Bolatagici even before she knew it as multimodalism. Because her interests in college varied so greatly, she pursued a media arts degree so that she could explore visual arts as they related to cultural studies. This pursuit grew into a career that now includes new modes and media sources, such as photography, video, and mixed media.</p>
<p id="auto_2c3e68b1-188b-48c0-86b9-29e528a400e7_para-00010">Choosing a multimodal approach because it better communicates the complex subjects she conveys, Bolatagici draws on her own experiences in order to represent the experiences of marginalized people at the forefront of her compositions. For Bolatagici, creating in any form is bigger than the page, and she aims to bring her reality to life through visual, textual, and multimedia creations that communicate in four dimensions.</p>

<p id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_para-00002">The multimodal genres of writing are based on the idea that modes work in different ways, with different outcomes, to create various vehicles for communication. By layering, or combining, modes, an author can make meaning and communicate through mixed modes what a single mode cannot on its own. Essentially, modes “cooperate” to communicate the author’s intent as they interweave meanings captured by each.</p>

<p id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_para-00003">For example, think of a public service announcement about environmental conservation. A composer can create a linguistic text about the dangers of plastic pollution in oceans and support the ideas with knowledge of or expertise in the subject. Yet words alone may not communicate the message forcefully, particularly if the audience consists of people who have never considered the impact of pollution on the oceans. That composer, then, might combine the text with images of massive amounts of human-generated plastic waste littering a shoreline, thus strengthening the argument and enhancing meaning by touching on audience emotions. By using images to convey some of the message, the composer layers modes. The picture alone does not tell the whole story, but when combined with informational text, it enhances the viewer’s understanding of the issue. Modes, therefore, can be combined in various ways to communicate a rhetorical idea effectively.</p>

Considering the audience is critical not only in traditional academic writing but also in nearly any genre or mode you choose.

<ul id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_list-00002">
<li>What (and how much) does the audience already know about the topic? The amount of background information needed can influence what genre, modes, and media types you include and how you use them. You don’t want to bore an audience with information that is common knowledge or overwhelm an audience with information they know nothing about.</li>
<li>What is the audience’s viewpoint on the subject? Are you creating for a skeptical audience or one that largely agrees with your rhetorical arguments?</li>

<p class="annotation culture-icon" id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_para-00006">It important to address audience diversity in all types of composition, but the unique aspects of multimodal composition present particular opportunities and challenges. First, when you compose, you do so through your own cultural filter, formed from your experiences, gender, education, and other factors. Multimodal composition opens up the ability to develop your cultural filter through various methods. Think about images of your lived experiences, videos capturing cultural events, or even gestures in live performances. Also consider the diversity of your audience members and how that affects the content choices you make during composition. Avoiding <span data-type="term" id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_term-00006">ethnocentrism</span>—the assumption that the customs, values, and beliefs of your culture are superior to others—is an important consideration when addressing your audience, as is using bias-free language, especially regarding ethnicity, gender, and abilities.</p>

<p id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_para-00007">Among the modes available to you as a composer, <span data-type="term" id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_term-00007">blogs</span> (regularly updated websites, usually run by an individual or a small group) have emerged as a significant genre in digital literature. The term <em data-effect="italics">blog</em>, a combination of<em data-effect="italics"> web </em>and <em data-effect="italics">log</em>, was coined in 1999 and gained rapid popularity in the early 2000s. In general, blogs have a relatively narrow focus on a topic or argument and present a distinctive structure that includes these features:</p>
<ul id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_list-00003">
<li>A headline or title draws in potential readers. Headlines are meant to grab attention, be short, and accurately reflect the content of the blog post.</li>
<li>An introduction hooks the reader, briefly introducing the topic and establishing the author’s credibility on the subject.</li>
<li>Short paragraphs often are broken up by images, videos, or other media to make meaning and supplement or support the text content.</li>
<li>The narrative is often composed in a style in which the author claims or demonstrates expertise.</li>
<li>Media such as images, video, and infographics depict information graphically and break up text.</li>
<li>Hyperlinks (links to other internet locations) to related content often serve as evidence supporting the author’s claim.</li>
<li>A call to action provides clear and actionable instructions that engage the reader.</li>

<p id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_para-00008">Blogs offer accessibility and an opportunity to make meaning in new ways. By integrating images and audiovisual media, you can develop a multimodal representation of arguments and ideas. Blogs also provide an outlet for conveying ideas through both personal and formal narratives and are used frequently in industries from entertainment to scientific research to government organizations.</p>
<p class="annotation visual-icon auditory-icon" id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_para-00009">Newer in the family of multimodal composition is the video blog, or <span data-type="term" id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_term-00008">vlog</span>, a blog for which the medium is video. Vlogs usually combine video embedded in a website with supporting text, images, or other modes of communication. Vlogging often takes on a narrative structure, similar to other types of storytelling, with the added element of supplementary audio and video, including digital transitions that connect one idea or scene to another. Vlogs offer ample opportunities to mix modalities.</p>
<p class="annotation speech-icon" id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_para-00010">Vlogs give a literal <em data-effect="italics">voice</em> to a composer, who typically narrates or speaks directly to the camera. Like a blogger, a vlog creator acts as an expert, telling a narrative story or using rhetoric to argue a point. Vlogs often strive to create an authentic and informal tone, similar to published blogs, inviting a stream-of-consciousness or interview-like style. Therefore, they often work well when targeted toward audiences for whom a casual mood is valuable and easily understood.</p>

<p id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_para-00011">Other creative compositions include websites, digital or print newsletters, podcasts, and a wide variety of other content. Each composition type has its own best practices regarding structure and organization, often depending on the chosen modalities, the way they are used, and the intended audience. Whatever the mode, however, all multimodal writing has several characteristics in common, beginning with effective, intentional composition.</p>
</section>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_sect-00004"><h3 data-type="title">Effective Writing</h3>
<p id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_para-00012">Experimenting with modes and media is not an excuse for poorly developed writing that lacks focus, organization, thought, purpose, or attention to mechanics. Although multimodal compositions offer flexibility of expression, the content still must be presented in well-crafted, organized, and purposeful ways that reflect the author’s purpose and the audience’s needs.</p>
<ul id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_list-00004">
<li>To be well-crafted, a composition should reflect the author’s use of literary devices to convey meaning, use of relevant connections, and acknowledgment of grammar and writing conventions.</li>
<li>To be organized, a composition should reflect the author’s use of effective transitions and a logical structure appropriate to the chosen mode.</li>
<li>To be purposeful, a composition should show that the author addresses the needs of the audience, uses rhetorical devices that advance the argument, and offers insightful understanding of the topic.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_para-00013"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_term-00009">Organization</span> of multimodal compositions refers to the sequence of message elements. You must decide which ideas require attention, how much and in what order, and which modalities create maximum impact on readers. While many types of formal and academic writing follow a prescribed format, or at least the general outline of one, the exciting and sometimes overwhelming features of multimodal possibilities open the door to any number of acceptable formats. Some of these are prescribed, and others more open ended; your job will inevitably be to determine when to follow a template and when to create something new. As the composer, you seek to structure media in ways that will enable the reader, or audience, to derive meaning. Even small changes in media, rhetorical appeal, and organization can alter the ways in which the audience participates in the construction of meaning.</p>
<p class="annotation visual-icon auditory-icon" id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_para-00014">Within a medium—for example, a video—you might include images, audio, and text. By shifting the organization, placement, and interaction among the modes, you change the structure of the video and therefore create varieties of meaning. Now, imagine you use that same structure of images, audio, and text, but change the medium to a slideshow. The impact on the audience will likely change with the change in medium. Consider the infamous opening scene of the horror movie <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_term-00013"><em data-effect="italics">The Shining</em></span> (1980). The primary medium, video, shows a car driving through a mountainous region. After audio is added, however, the meaning of the multimodal composition changes, creating an emphasis through <span data-type="term" id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_term-00014">pace</span><strong data-effect="bold"> </strong>and tone that communicates something new to the audience. The format, inclusion, and exclusion of multiple modalities shape emphasis through structure.</p>
<figure id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_fig-00004"><figcaption>The opening scenes of <em data-effect="italics">The Shining</em> feature the serene-looking Saint Mary Lake with its Wild Goose Island.

<p id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_para-00015">These are the key terms and characteristics of multimodal texts.</p>
<ul id="auto_94b23b86-3757-4313-8bf1-b7026aa441fb_list-00005">
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Alignment:</strong> the way in which elements such as text features, images, and particularly text are placed on a page. Text can be aligned at the left, center, or right. Alignment contributes to organization and how media transitions within a text.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Audience: </strong>readers or viewers of the composition.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Channel:</strong> a medium used to communicate a message. Often-used channels include websites, blogs, social media, print, audio, and video-hosting sites.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Complementary:</strong> describes content that is different across two or more modes, both of which are necessary for understanding. Often audio and visual modes are complementary, with one making the other more meaningful. </li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Emphasis: </strong>the elements in media that are most significant or pronounced. The emphasis choices have a major impact on the overall meaning of the text.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Focus: </strong>a clear purpose for composition, also called the central idea, main point, or guiding principle. Focus should include the specific audience the composer is trying to influence.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Layering: </strong>combining modes in a single composition.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Layout:</strong> the organization of elements on a page, including text, images, shapes, and overall composition. Layout applies primarily to the visual mode.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Media: </strong>the means and channels of reaching an audience (for example, image, website, song). A medium (singular form of <em data-effect="italics">media</em>) can contain multiple modes.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Mode:</strong> the method of communication (linguistic, visual, audio, or spatial means of creating meaning). Media can incorporate more than one mode.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Organization:</strong> the pattern of arrangement that allows a reader to understand text or images in a composition. Organization may be textual, visual, or spatial.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Proximity:</strong> the relationship between objects in space, specifically how close to or far from one another they are. Proximity can show a relationship between elements and is often important in layout.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Purpose:</strong> an author’s reason for writing a text, including the reasoning that accounts for which modes of presentation to use. Composers of multimodal texts may seek to persuade, inform, or entertain the audience.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Repetition:</strong> a unifying feature, such as a pattern used more than once, in the way in which elements (text features, typeface, color, etc.) are used on a page. Repetition often indicates emphasis or a particular theme. Repetitions and patterns can help focus a composition, explore a theme, and emphasize important points.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Supplementary:</strong> describes content that is different in two or more modes, where a composer uses one mode to convey primary understanding and the other(s) to support or extend understanding. Supplementary content should not be thought of as “extra,” for its purpose is to expand on the primary media.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Text:</strong> written words. In multimodal composition, text can refer to a piece of communication as a whole, incorporating written words, images, sounds, and movement.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Tone:</strong> the composer’s attitude toward the subject and/or the audience.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Transitions:</strong> words, phrases, or audiovisual elements that help readers make connections between ideas in a multimodal text, including connections from sentence to sentence, paragraph to paragraph, and mode to mode. Transitions show relationships between ideas and help effectively organize a composition.</li>

<p id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_para-00002">As a multimodal composer, you may choose to employ <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_term-00001">ethos</span>, a rhetorical method of persuasion. In this context, ethos is an appeal to readers in order to establish the author’s credibility and character. In a rhetorical appeal, you can use ethos through fair, neutral language to show trustworthiness. In multimodal composition, ethos aims to convince readers that you are a reliable and an ethical expert on the subject. When using ethos, authors present sources that support their argument in balanced and honest ways, revealing their writing to be reliable. Authors also seek to understand their audience, establishing commonalities between those who support the issue, those who are undecided or indifferent, and those who dissent. Often, authors invoke the words or ideas of respected figures, authorities, or even religious texts when using ethos to convince readers. Analyzing multimodal compositions can help you learn how to use rhetorical frames in the multimodal composing process. In the blog post you are about to read, the author uses ethos, along with structural aspects of multimodal texts, to establish herself as a trustworthy expert on the subject of pollution prevention. Studying the components of multimodal writing in this blog will help you understand how multimedia platforms utilize elements of text, media, and modes.</p>

<p class="public-domain" id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_para-00004">On this day in 1990, a new era was ushered in for <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_term-00002">Environmental Protection Agency</span> (EPA) and the nation when the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_term-00003">Pollution Prevention (P2) Act</span> was signed into law. The act gave the agency new tools to join with states, tribes, and communities to prevent pollution <em data-effect="italics">before</em> it happens. It also marked a shift in the paradigm of environmental protection, which had been mostly focused on end-of-pipe pollution control and clean-up strategies.</p>

Not only does it clearly preface the article by informing the reader of its topic (the Pollution Prevention Act), but it also presents the author’s positive attitude toward the subject through the words </em>celebrating<em data-effect="italics"> and </em>win-win<em data-effect="italics">.</em></p>
<p class="annotation-text" id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_para-00006"><em data-effect="italics"><strong data-effect="bold">Context.</strong> Dunn contextualizes the Pollution Prevention Act, showing it as a positive national achievement that partnered the government with the people to prevent pollution.</em></p>
<p class="public-domain" id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_para-00007">Equally important, the P2 Act strengthened EPA’s role as an ally of American businesses, helping them save billions of dollars and improve operations. As EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has said, “It’s far better to prevent pollution from occurring than to go in after the fact and clean it up.”</p>
<p class="annotation-text" id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_para-00008"><em data-effect="italics"><strong data-effect="bold">Quotation from an Authority.</strong> This quotation from the EPA administrator supports Dunn’s assertion that the P2 Act is good for America.

Thus far, she has supported the claims that it has improved the environment and helped local governments and private businesses.</em></p>
<p class="public-domain" id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_para-00010">The P2 Act greatly expanded the opportunities for “source reduction” to reduce or prevent pollution at the source through cost-effective changes in production, operation, and raw materials use. These changes can reduce the amount of pollution entering a waste stream or the environment prior to recycling, treatment or disposal, and can offer industry substantial savings in reduced raw material, pollution control, pollution clean-up and liability costs.</p>

<p class="public-domain" id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_para-00013">One of EPA’s first pollution prevention successes was with its 33/50 Program, a voluntary program under which companies committed to reduce their releases of 17 top priority chemicals 33 percent by 1992 and by 50 percent by 1995. Subsequent EPA programs built on the 33/50 and P2 model and are still working to reduce pollution across the country today including EPA’s <a href="https://openstax.org/r/watersense">WaterSense</a>, <a href="https://openstax.org/r/safer_choice">Safer Choice</a>, <a href="https://openstax.org/r/environmentally">Environmentally Preferable Purchasing</a>, <a href="https://openstax.org/r/green">Green Chemistry</a>, and our <a href="https://openstax.org/r/smartway">SmartWay Transport Partnership Program</a>. President Trump acknowledged the effectiveness of these and other EPA programs in a 2018 Executive Order that directed federal agencies to use EPA’s P2 resources to meet their statutory sustainable purchasing requirements.</p>
<p class="annotation-text" id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_para-00014"><em data-effect="italics"><strong data-effect="bold">Hyperlinks.</strong> Hyperlinks are a functional tool and employ the visual mode to command the reader’s attention.

<p class="public-domain" id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_para-00015">The P2 Act also serves as an authority for collecting information from reporting facilities through the <a href="https://openstax.org/r/toxics">Toxics Release Inventory</a> (TRI) about their management of certain toxic chemicals, including source reduction approaches. Since this reporting began in 1991, we have learned that over 24,000 unique facilities have taken more than 450,000 actions to prevent pollution and reduce the amount of toxic chemicals entering the environment, such as spill and leak prevention measures, using safer chemicals, modifying industrial processes, and updating operating procedures.</p>

<p class="public-domain" id="auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_para-00018">Perhaps the most impactful and collaborative program to grow out of the P2 Act is EPA’s P2 Grants Program. Since 1990, EPA has awarded more than 1,200 grants to state, tribal, non-profit, and university partners to work directly with U.S. businesses to develop and implement source reduction techniques. With the assistance from P2 grants, businesses have been able to save over $1.5 billion since 2011 while also reducing the use of hazardous materials by over 570 million pounds.</p>

<p class="annotation linguistic-icon dreaming-icon" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00002">Now you will experiment with using multiple modes to create an advocacy project. An advocacy project tells the story of an overarching problem—for example, world hunger—and uses multiple modalities to inform readers about that issue and to propose change. You may be familiar with similar advocacy projects; perhaps you have been involved with them in your everyday life. Think carefully about advocacy initiatives you know of or have encountered, and find out whether you can pinpoint the answers to these three questions: <em data-effect="italics">What problem is being addressed? Who is the intended audience? What mode or modes are being used, including what media?</em> Then think about what works. <em data-effect="italics">How do the chosen media speak to the specific audience? Why might the initiative’s creators have made those choices?</em></p>

<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00003">After you have chosen a cause and begun working through the composition, you might want to tweak the modes you are working with, including how they relate to one another. You may find, for example, that your primary communication to readers would be better achieved with a different mode or that you need stronger transitions to move your reader through your rhetorical appeal. Don’t be afraid to experiment, revise, and examine your project from different angles. Just like a literary text, a multimodal composition is a living document, one that can be improved over time with peer review and revision. As you work, focus your project by concentrating on addressing your audience, purpose, and organization.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_sect-00002"><h3 data-type="title">Summary of Assignment</h3>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00004">Create a multimodal advocacy project for a cause or an issue that you choose or that your instructor chooses for you. If you are free to choose your own topic, here is a short list from which you may draw inspiration:</p>
<ul id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_list-00002">
<li>Providing clean and safe water</li>
<li>Ending gun violence</li>
<li>Addressing nutritional needs of children locally or around the world</li>
<li>Anti-bullying</li>
<li>Reducing your carbon footprint</li>
<li>Access to health care</li>
<li>Anti-racism</li>
<li>Vaccination policies</li>
<li>Social media and free speech</li>
<li>Climate change</li>
<li>Immigration</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00005">You may also use these brainstorming questions to narrow down your topic:</p>
<ul id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_list-00003">
<li>What are you passionate about?</li>
<li>Where do you notice a need in your community / the world?</li>
<li>What ideas do you have for addressing the issue?</li>
<li>What existing campaigns do you find compelling, and why?</li>
<li>What existing projects can you build on, and how?</li>
<li>What goals do you hope to achieve?</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00006">Choose a need or an issue that is important to you, because you will develop a rhetorical appeal to inform and convince your audience. Although world hunger is an important issue and may not be a bad example, consider choosing problems that you encounter locally, even in your everyday life. The closer you are to the issue, the more easily you will be able to develop rhetorical appeals. As you compose your project, consider the best modes and methods to communicate your ideas. Consider how to add and combine different modalities to increase audience impact without overdoing it.</p>

Ensure that your proposed advocacy provides pragmatic and helpful solutions to the problem for the targeted audience. For example, if you choose to create a project based on the need for education opportunities for young mothers who have survived domestic abuse, advocating for full-time schooling options with no consideration for childcare would be neither pragmatic nor helpful. In other words, don’t assume you know best. Open yourself to information gleaned from research, interviews, or informal conversation. If possible, try to speak with someone whom your project will affect.</p>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00008">Determine what others are already doing to address the need you have identified, and decide whether to build on that work or take a different route. Identify the most effective means of translating the vision you decide on for your audience, which may differ from the audience targeted by other advocacy groups.</p>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00009"><strong data-effect="bold"><em data-effect="italics">Another Lens 2.</em></strong> Another option for approaching this project is to identify and analyze multimodal advocacy initiatives already occurring on a large scale today. Some well-known ones include <a href="https://openstax.org/r/water">Charity: Water</a>, <a href="https://openstax.org/r/rice">Free Rice</a>, <a href="https://openstax.org/r/it_gets">It Gets Better</a>, and <a href="https://openstax.org/r/upworthy">Upworthy</a>. After choosing an advocacy campaign to research, consider the following:</p>
<ul id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_list-00004">
<li>What is the purpose of the advocacy initiative? What do the organizers want to achieve?</li>
<li>Whom does the initiative address? (Knowing the target audience will help you analyze how effectively the organizers use a multimodal approach to reach them.)</li>
<li>How does the initiative persuade its audience? Are rhetorical appeals used, and if so, how? Why do you think these choices are made?</li>
<li>What modes of communication are being used? (These may include social media platforms and streams.) Does the campaign rely more on textual or non-textual media to convey its message? How are modes combined, and how effective are these choices?</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00010">After thinking about these questions, create an addition to this advocacy initiative. Introduce your composition by explaining what you have included and why.</p>

<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00011">After you have decided on your topic, the first step is to identify the primary <span data-type="term" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_term-00001">purpose</span>, or reason, for your advocacy project. Your goal is what you want to accomplish with it. Do you intend to inform people about an issue they are likely to know little about, or do you want to inspire people around you to take action in creating a sustainable solution that addresses the issue at hand?<strong data-effect="bold"> </strong>Goals are broad statements and can be general and abstract, as in the case of this goal: <em data-effect="italics">Improve access to clean water for students in Flint, Michigan.</em></p>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00012">Part of identifying your goal is to articulate your <span data-type="term" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_term-00002">claim</span>, or assertion, about the issue you have chosen. Your claim is equivalent to a thesis in a traditional written essay. Identifying your purpose and goal will help you decide how to structure your project and, ultimately, which media and modes to employ.</p>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00013">Consider also your audience.

<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00026">After you define the situation, it is time to choose the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_term-00008">mode</span> or modes to communicate your ideas to your audience. For example, will you write an op-ed, or opinion piece, in which you formally discuss the issue and advocate for change? Will you write and deliver a speech that relies on rhetorical devices to convey your passion for the issue?<em data-effect="italics"> </em>You might also consider<em data-effect="italics"> </em>advertisements and public service announcements (PSAs), including audio and video versions, as other effective ways to “sell” a concept, often combining modes for added impact. For examples, peruse <a href="https://openstax.org/r/op-edproject">The Op-Ed Project</a> or the <a href="https://openstax.org/r/adcouncil">Ad Council</a>.</p>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00027">Just as your choice of topic must be rhetorically sound and specific, your choice of mode should be based on the circumstances under which your audience will best meet and respond to your advocacy project. This decision may feel daunting, because composing within the multimodal genres means that you have many options. You might choose a video advertisement, a visual flyer, a performance, a photo essay, or something completely different. Consider the modes you might use to accomplish your goals, responding to the needs of your audience.</p>

<p class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00061">Once you have determined your purpose and audience and have considered the impact of including multiple modes and media, it is time to begin drafting your project.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_sect-00007"><h4 data-type="title">Gathering Information</h4>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00062">The first step in any project is to collect and analyze sources. You will likely need to explore relevant research, data, and literature that already address your topic. The following questions are a good place to start: <em data-effect="italics">What do you already know about the issue you have chosen to address? What do you need to learn, and where can you find that information?</em></p>
<p class="annotation culture-icon" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00063">When considering the data and research you read and collect, it is important to address multiple perspectives, particularly regarding culture, language, and social issues. It is essential to have a clear understanding of the needs of the community you seek to advocate for, as defined by that community.</p>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00064">Now plan for the ways in which your project will create and support the argument, the modes and media you will use, and how these will reach your audience. Start by completing a graphic organizer like <a href="#auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_table-00002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Begin with what you already know, including the sources of that information, formal research you have done, and informal or anecdotal data you have. After looking carefully at what you have, ask yourself what you still need to learn about the topic to understand and communicate the issue to your audience. Finally, brainstorm for strategies to learn that information. These may include research, interviews, or other methods of data collection. Then carry out that information collection until you have what you need.</p>

<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00065">Once your research is complete (or, at least, once you have a good enough foundation to get started), determine which modes and media you will employ to address your audience. Research, like composition as a whole, is largely an open-ended process, one in which you may need to experiment to determine whether the modes, media, and genres you choose accurately and effectively communicate your purpose to the audience. A good way to make this decision is to create a mockup or storyboard. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_term-00009">mockup</span> is a visual representation of compositions that are basically static. You can use a mockup for media such as websites, posters, or photo essays. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_term-00010">storyboard</span><strong data-effect="bold"> </strong>is a sequence of drawings that represents the progression of a piece that moves through time. You can use a storyboard for media such as videos or podcasts.</p>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00066">Use <a href="#auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_fig-00003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_fig-00004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> for your mockup or storyboard. Remember to consider <em data-effect="italics">all</em> modes, including linguistic, visual, audio, spatial, and gestural, and what impact they will make on your audience.</p>

<p class="annotation visual-icon" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00067">When you finish, look over your mockup or storyboard. Then consider whether your choices effectively address the needs of your audience. For example, a student composing a project calling for humanitarian efforts to improve the living conditions of citizens in war-torn Syria might choose the genre of a photo essay, with visual media and captions used as a powerful way to tell the story. This choice will be more effective than relying mainly on text or other means alone.</p>

<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00068">That student might ask and answer questions such as the following:</p>
<ul id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_list-00005">
<li>What do I want to convey? The desperate situation in Syria because of the war</li>
<li>Who is my audience? Online readers interested in current events</li>
<li>How do the media I’ve chosen speak to the audience? They tell a story more powerfully than text can by itself.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00069">As you brainstorm, don’t feel obligated to include every piece of information or media you collect. You’ll want to choose carefully, ensuring that the information and media you use serve your audience and rhetorical goals.</p>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00070">As preparation for writing, consider different types of media, and match them to their appropriate purposes in this interactive.</p>

<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00071">After establishing the primary genre, it’s time to define the purpose for introducing other genres, including how you will introduce them smoothly with seamless transitions. In the example above, the student chooses a photo essay as the primary genre. A photo essay usually includes multiple pictures, laid out on a blog or website with or without text. If there is an opportunity to directly address the audience, the student might consider writing a script to incorporate the genre of presentation. Or they might choose to create a slideshow or video, incorporating a voice-over or textual quotations. All of these choices depend on their purpose as the composer, the rhetorical methods they believe will work best, and a knowledge of their audience, including how best to respond to social and cultural needs. It’s important not to incorporate more modes simply for the sake of having more. Each choice you make will either enhance or detract from your purpose.</p>

<p class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00072">Countless tools are available for creating multimodal texts. At first, this project may seem daunting as you ponder which tool to choose and possibly learn to use new technology. However, you will likely find you can use tools that are not only familiar but also readily available. Software and apps that you already have on your phone, tablet, or laptop, such as PowerPoint, Google Slides, and Keynote, not only are useful for slideshows but also allow you to create graphics and videos that you can upload to YouTube with a single click. You can record podcasts by using the memo feature on your phone or a free online recording tool and then upload them to SoundCloud.</p>

<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00073">After you have created your mockup or storyboard, it is time to create the first draft of your project. Sometimes called a <em data-effect="italics">first cut</em>, particularly in audiovisual presentations, this is the next step in drafting the composition’s basic elements. It is also your chance to experiment with the modes and media you have considered to determine what works and what doesn’t. This first cut creates a <span data-type="term" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_term-00014">prototype</span>, a preliminary model or draft, that you will revise according to feedback from peer review. Consider this prototype as a starting point. Keep in mind that the composition process, like the writing process, is <span data-type="term" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_term-00015">recursive</span>, not linear.

Because the composition primarily uses the visual mode, the student created a mockup, which includes the photo from <a href="#auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_fig-00005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> as well as other photos and shared information.</p>

Although there were other options for this photo essay, the student considered them and decided to use only images with some supporting text, basing this choice on purpose, audience, and organizational principles. As you consider your options, begin by focusing on one mode, then build a mockup according to your audience and purpose. The mockup may be as simple as an outline of a speech or a PowerPoint template to which you add text and images. The idea is to create a concrete piece to use for your prototype.</p>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00076">Creating the prototype is the next step.

<p class="annotation visual-icon" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00077">For the prototype, the student made several choices related to the visual mode, incorporating both textual and graphic images. Remember that the composer stated an intent to convey the desperate situation in Syria resulting from war and is speaking to an audience of online readers interested in current events.</p>
<p class="annotation visual-icon" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00078">The first element added is a <span data-type="term" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_term-00016">headline</span>, “The Syrian War.” It allows the reader to know immediately what the topic is and get a general idea of the context of the photo essay. The student has taken the text from the mockup and for each picture created a <span data-type="term" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_term-00017">caption</span>—a short statement that provides context for each event depicted and helps readers progress through the narrative of the photo essay. In addition, the composer has chosen to stage the captions against a black backdrop with white space between each photograph and caption, a visually appealing layout that is effective in its use of transitions.

<p class="annotation speech-icon" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00080">Peer review is an important step in helping you determine the ways in which your multimodal composition works well and how it can be improved. Peer review allows you to gain an outside perspective on your writing and composing processes and thus makes it easier to clear up any questions related to organization, purpose, audience, and genre.</p>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00081">For your review, provide your peer reviewer with your mockup or storyboard and your prototype. Seeing your process may help your reviewer offer feedback and suggestions. Your peer reviewer can use the following questions to think critically about your project, focusing on both its strengths and its areas for improvement, and to guide their feedback. Your response to these questions will guide your revision process.</p>

<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00082">You will next revise your project, using your discretion to incorporate your peer reviewer’s feedback. After considering reviewer comments, actively engage with that feedback to plan your revisions. As with textual compositions, revisions to multimodal compositions often involve rewording, shifting ideas, and rewriting to better address your audience and purpose.</p>

<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00083">To begin the revision process, answer the questions your peer reviewer has posed. Focus first on the rhetorical situation, including your composition’s topic, purpose, and audience as well as questions surrounding culture. Reflect on improvements you might make to represent and communicate the rhetorical situation within the scope of a multimodal composition. Consider using these sentence frames to answer your reviewer’s questions.</p>
<ul id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_list-00010">
<li>The reason I chose this genre is ________ (relate to purpose/audience/organization). I could better communicate by ________.</li>
<li>I used rhetorical appeal through ________. This is effective in this way: ________ but can be strengthened further by ________.</li>
<li>I considered the culture of (myself/viewers or readers/subject of composition) by ________. Other cultural components I would like to consider or address are ________. My plan to do that is ________.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00084">Next, answer questions about genre and media. <em data-effect="italics">How might the tools available serve you more effectively? Is your choice of media the most effective to communicate with your audience? What aspects of the primary genre are key to helping you convey your issue? How can you introduce other genres, or aspects of other genres, to strengthen the impact? </em>In responding, be mindful of creating smooth transitions and content that is uncluttered and clear in meaning. Consider using these sentence frames to answer your reviewer’s questions.</p>
<ul id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_list-00011">
<li>The genre ________ captures the message I am trying to convey by ________. I could strengthen this communication by ________.</li>

<p class="student-sample" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00086">I chose the photo essay genre to show the effects of war in Syria in an expressive, meaningful way. I designed a simple layout contrasting the colors black and white to organize the narrative. I primarily called on pathos to invoke the emotions and values of viewers, drawing them in with powerful images, but I think I could strengthen the emotional appeal by rearranging the pictures and more clearly addressing the most powerful statement: that 80 percent of the city was left uninhabitable. I also think my headline could be more attention grabbing, and I plan to revise it to draw viewers in and more accurately reflect the subject matter. I will revise my composition to achieve a more effective presentation by editing my text to make it more direct and by reordering my photos to leave viewers with a more forceful statement.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_sect-00018"><h4 data-type="title">Revising</h4>
<p class="annotation speech-icon" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00087">In creating multimodal compositions, revising can refer to taking multiple pieces of content and arranging, rearranging, deleting, and adding to the greater whole. Consider the project on the war in Syria. If choosing to create a video of the photo essay with a voice-over, the student might rearrange the order of photographs or choose which photos to show during particular audio clips, depending on the student’s reflection on the peer reviewer’s questions.</p>
<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00088">Alternatively, the student might choose to keep the same format, thinking that it best expresses what they hope to communicate. However, the student might make revisions based on the peer reviewer’s feedback and their own reflection, in which the student mentions revising the text, reordering photos, and changing the headline. Consider this revision of the sample photo essay, in <a href="#auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_fig-00011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00089">The author makes revisions according to peer reviewer feedback and reflection of that feedback, particularly as it relates to purpose, organization, and audience. To get a better sense of the revision process, carefully examine the student’s thought process.</p>
<p class="student-sample" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00090">I revised the headline from “The Syrian War” to “Remnants of War—Syria.” This headline is more engaging for readers and viewers and better reflects the purpose of my project: to convey the desperate situation in Syria resulting from the war that has ravaged citizens’ lives.</p>
<p class="student-sample" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00091">I changed the aesthetic by using a black-and-white filter on the photos. Not only does this contrast with the white space and white text, creating a more organized and cleaner look, it more effectively appeals to readers’ emotions by emphasizing the destitution left by the Syrian War.</p>
<p class="student-sample" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00092">I rewrote the captions of the final three pictures to make them closer to one another in word count, which is visually more pleasing. But even more important, they create a more powerful narrative, building upon one another.</p>
<p class="student-sample" id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00093">I reordered the final two pictures, ending on what I consider the most powerful image and most powerful statement: that 80 percent of the city was uninhabitable after the war. I intend to increase viewers’ emotional responses with these changes.</p>
  <p id="auto_78a58d46-6a29-4972-b848-385be0c8057f_para-00094">Remember that you do not have to accept every suggestion a peer reviewer makes, but do give each question and suggestion careful thought. Pay close attention to your reviewer’s questions and their perception of your purpose and audience in particular, ensuring that they match yours. And again, don’t be afraid to experiment. One benefit of multimodal composition, particularly when created with digital media, is that it is relatively quick and easy to manipulate. One valuable tip is to duplicate your work in different workspaces as you make changes, thus saving the major elements of your project should something go wrong.</p>

Remember that although transitions in various genres may differ, logical transitions are an important element in helping your audience “read” your text.</p>

<p class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="auto_0d9219fc-75c8-493b-97c7-3122b61c7d2e_para-00003"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_0d9219fc-75c8-493b-97c7-3122b61c7d2e_term-00002">Linguistic text</span> uses transitions to create relationships between sentences, between paragraphs, and between sections of text. Consider this sentence-to-sentence transition from “Celebrating a Win-Win: 30 Years of Progress under the Pollution Prevention Act” by Alexandra Dapolito Dunn.</p>

<p class="public-domain" id="auto_0d9219fc-75c8-493b-97c7-3122b61c7d2e_para-00004">The act gave the agency new tools to join with states, tribes, and communities to prevent pollution <em data-effect="italics">before</em> it happens. It also marked a shift in the paradigm of environmental protection, which had been mostly focused on end-of-pipe pollution control and clean-up strategies.</p>

<p id="auto_0d9219fc-75c8-493b-97c7-3122b61c7d2e_para-00005">The phrase <em data-effect="italics">it also</em> helps readers connect the ideas from each sentence: that the Prevention Pollution Act provides new tools <em data-effect="italics">and</em> that it focuses on preventing pollution instead of the former strategy of addressing pollution after it occurs. The next sentence from the article begins a new paragraph.</p>

<p class="public-domain" id="auto_0d9219fc-75c8-493b-97c7-3122b61c7d2e_para-00006">Equally important, the P2 Act strengthened EPA’s role as an ally of American businesses, helping them save billions of dollars and improve operations.</p>

<p id="auto_0d9219fc-75c8-493b-97c7-3122b61c7d2e_para-00007">Here, the author uses the transition phrase <em data-effect="italics">equally important</em>, signaling a new idea related to the Prevention Pollution Act (that it saved American businesses money) and providing context for how it ranks in importance (it is equally important). You can refer to <a href="#a6effe4c-d96c-484f-9052-4f93d26da570">Editing Focus: Paragraphs and Transitions</a> for more information on textual transitions.</p>

<p class="annotation visual-icon" id="auto_0d9219fc-75c8-493b-97c7-3122b61c7d2e_para-00008">In multimodal compositions, you will have to think about transitions differently. First, consider how images and blank space work together when modes are mixed. Often, a margin of space around images helps organize a composition. Colors and other visual features can also serve as transitions, as seen in the following graphic. An important part of multimodal compositions is readability, particularly related to density of text. How might you revise this graphic to increase readability?</p>

</figure>

<p id="auto_0d9219fc-75c8-493b-97c7-3122b61c7d2e_para-00009">Further, a composer must make decisions about how different media interact with one another when more than one genre is introduced. Think about multimodal compositions you encounter in your everyday life, such as websites or flyers. Those that are effective may have a host of different features, modes, and media, but they likely have elements in common: they are visually appealing, organized, and provide the information you need without overwhelming. Consider <a href="#auto_0d9219fc-75c8-493b-97c7-3122b61c7d2e_fig-00002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, a photo essay located at the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter plant in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>

<p class="annotation visual-icon" id="auto_0d9219fc-75c8-493b-97c7-3122b61c7d2e_para-00010">The composer uses different modes to communicate clearly and help readers transition between ideas. While photographs of varying sizes are the primary media used to emphasize the evolution of aircraft design, the composer includes text boxes that overlay photographs and aid in providing context and transition between ideas. In addition, some of the photographs have been cut out and placed so as to rise above the flat surface of the background. In this case, the composer has chosen not to employ white space but to layer the text boxes and photographs on top of a large background photograph. Also missing are long textual blocks. The composer presents the necessary information in short excerpts and quotations.</p>

<td>The project’s claims are extremely weak. The composition has no discernible purpose, organization, audience, and culture.</td>

<p class="annotation culture-icon" id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00002">Technology is a crucial element in multimodal composition. In fact, the emergence of digital technology has vastly changed the landscape of multimodal composition in recent years. The rise of technology has resulted in new communication and composition practices in people’s social, academic, and professional lives. Technology also plays a role in the rhetorical approach to writing and composition, increasing the complexity of expression, communication, and persuasion. Indeed, technology has both challenged and transformed long-held ideas about what it means to write.</p>

<p id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00003">Within the genre of multimodal composition, there is a growing call for design advocacy, part of which means redefining and recontextualizing the rhetoric of design to make multimodal compositions more inclusive not only for those with differing abilities but also for those marginalized according to social, technological, and cultural equity.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_sect-00002"><h3 data-type="title">Digital Deserts</h3>
<p class="annotation culture-icon" id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00004">One challenge posed by the incorporation of technology in multimodal composition is the presence of <span data-type="term" id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_term-00001">digital deserts</span>, or places affected by a digital divide, where residents have no access to the high-speed internet connections required to consume and create digital media. The Federal Communications Commission produced data indicating that in 2017, 21.3 million Americans lacked access to high-speed internet service, and of those people, 2.2 million households had no internet access at all. Studies show that this data may be understated, with even more people living in digital deserts. Rural parts of the country are disproportionately affected, but people living in low-income urban areas make up a significant portion of these numbers.</p>
<p id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00005">To participate in the consumption or creation of most multimodal composition, students need access to high-speed internet, defined by the FCC as a download speed of 25 Mbps and an upload speed of 3 Mbps. When no such access exists, cultural, social, and educational disparities arise within the genre of multimodal literature. Students who have less access to the technology required to read, view, or create multimodal works are excluded from this relatively new form of literature, leading to cultural underrepresentation and placing them at academic and social disadvantages.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_sect-00003"><h3 data-type="title">Enhancing Usability and Accessibility</h3>
<p class="annotation culture-icon" id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00006">Other considerations affecting multimodal compositions are usability and accessibility for readers of differing abilities. These may be associated with speech, hearing, vision, and/or motor impairments, among others. Universal accessibility aims to produce content that all people, regardless of abilities, can use, often with assistive technologies, solutions, and tools. Although new fields within the education landscape, such as universal design, have made great strides in usability and accessibility, multimodal content can enhance these strides in unique ways for students and for all consumers of multimodal compositions.</p>
<p id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00007">Multimodal compositions often include interaction constraints. These can be thought of as filters that limit a user’s ability to access consumer content effectively. For example, a person who has vision impairment may experience interaction constraints when attempting to consume a photo essay. This constraint can be eased through technologies that help make the media more meaningful, such as text and audio alternatives that help the user experience the composition in a way similar to its original form.</p>
<p id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00008">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are intended to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. However, creators of multimodal compositions can adapt and apply WCAG rules and principles, such as those discussed below, even to compositions that are not web based.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_sect-00004"><h4 data-type="title">Provide Informative Titles and Headings</h4>
<p id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00009">Content titles and headlines that accurately describe and distinguish the composition from others are helpful for contextualizing the composition. A headline usually refers to a composition within something larger, such as an article in a magazine, whereas a title encompasses an entire entity in itself, such as a novel or story that stands on its own. Consider the headline of the blog post you read earlier, “Celebrating a Win-Win: 30 Years of Progress under the Pollution Prevention Act.” This headline is informative, telling the audience that the post is about the progress of the Pollution Prevention Act. It also informs readers of the author’s perspective on this topic, clearly indicating her belief in the success of the act. For the photo essay about the war in Syria, the student writer revised the original headline to the more specific and meaningful <em data-effect="italics">Remnants of War—Syria</em>.</p>

<p id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00010">Headings and short subheads group related information, clearly describe sections of text or media, and provide an outline of the content. Although they are a standard feature of informational texts, headings and subheads can be explored within multimodal compositions as organizational and accessibility features, as they are used in the infographic shown in <a href="#auto_0d9219fc-75c8-493b-97c7-3122b61c7d2e_fig-00001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, <em data-effect="italics">United Nations poster</em>. The subheads clarify the structure of the composition, indicating features such as the introduction and author’s objectives, and provide transitions between sections.</p>

<p id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00011">When using hyperlinks within a multimodal composition, write text that describes the content of the link target. Instead of using vague text such as “click here” or simply using the URL as the hyperlink, use the opportunity to include relevant information about the content of the link. This added content serves as a transition and emphasizes the relationship between the media. Alexandra Dapolito Dunn does this in the blog post in <a href="#auto_bff4f751-1e36-45fe-b2de-ffa6a15936b5_sect-00001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, specifying in her text the content of the link used:</p>

<p id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00013">All images and other graphic representations should have meaningful alternative text that helps readers understand the information portrayed in the image and its significance to the function of the composition. Consider <a href="#auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_fig-00001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>:</p>

</figure>
<p id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00014">Briefly, the caption provides context and any other important information that cannot be gathered simply by looking at the image. Alternative (Alt) text, in contrast, describes <em data-effect="italics">only</em> the information that can be gathered by simply looking at the image (the “what the image shows” part of the caption sentence). Alt text for this image might read “Large crowd of soccer fans waving national flags.” Alternative text is imperative for those who have vision impairments because it enables them fuller comprehension of the media.</p>

<p class="annotation visual-icon auditory-icon" id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00015">Audiovisual content, such as videos and podcasts, can be especially challenging for users with visual or auditory disabilities. Therefore, include clear and specific transcripts and captions to guide users through content in your multimodal compositions. In video transcripts, describe visual content (for example, “Joey enters the room” whenever that action occurs). For audio content, include text that indicates spoken information and other sound that is important for understanding the content (for example, “Trumpets softly play the national anthem in the background”). Again, these small additions make your multimodal media accessible to consumers of all abilities.</p>

<p id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00016">One of the most exciting parts of composing is publishing your work. Technology affords multimodal composers numerous options for publishing. Whether or not you create your composition through digital means, you can use technology in the publishing process. First, know that you want your published product to be a finished work that incorporates the revisions and edits you made during the peer review process. This step is occasionally skipped in the multimodal composition process, mostly because digital publishing can be more accessible than other traditional publishing methods. Nevertheless, as a composer, you want your published product to be your best work.</p>
<p id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_para-00017">Depending on which modes and media you include, consider the following options for publishing your multimodal advocacy project.</p>
<ul id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_list-00002">
<li><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_term-00002">Blogs</span>, which usually include text, images, and videos, can be self-published on free or inexpensive web-based platforms such as WordPress, Adobe Experience Manager, and others. Any author or group can start a blog and create posts that incorporate multimodal content.</li>
<li>As an alternative to blogs, consider the digital <span data-type="term" id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_term-00003">flipbook</span> format, the equivalent of a digital magazine. Platforms such as Issuu allow content creators to organize content in a format in which the viewer scrolls left and right by “flipping” pages. Flipbooks offer more options for layout, organization, and transitions.</li>
<li>You may instead choose to publish your completed composition on a <span data-type="term" id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_term-00004">video</span> hosting site such as YouTube or Vimeo.</li>
<li class="annotation kinesthetic-icon">You can also use technology to publish non-digital multimodal compositions, such as performances, presentations, or hard-copy posters and the like. This kind of publication typically involves another layer of mode mixing, such as recording a live performance or uploading a picture of an artwork to a digital platform.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="auto_25e4bbfb-94ae-4f67-ad5c-b23713d52932_fig-00003"><figcaption>Publishing a multimedia composition will allow you to present your best work to spread your message.

Paragraphs help readers make their way through prose writing by presenting it in manageable chunks. Transitions link sentences and paragraphs so that readers see clearly how your points relate to one another.
</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-idm241652288"><h4 data-type="title">Effective Paragraphs</h4>
<p id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-idm250832192">Paragraphs are guides for readers. Each new paragraph signals either a new idea, further development of an existing idea, or a new direction. An effective paragraph has a main point supported by evidence, is organized in a sensible way, and is neither too short nor too long. When a paragraph is too short, it often lacks enough evidence and examples to back up your claims. When a paragraph is too long, readers can lose the point you are making. </p>
<section data-depth="3" id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-idm229937568"><h5 data-type="title">Developing a Main Point</h5>
<p id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-idm246463200">A paragraph is easier to write and easier to read when it centers on a main point. Often the main point of the paragraph is expressed in a topic sentence, which announces that point. The topic sentence frequently comes at the start of the paragraph, but not always. No matter the position, however, the rest of the sentences in the paragraph support the main point. </p>
</section>
<section data-depth="3" id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-idm260067040"><h5 data-type="title">Supporting Evidence and Analysis</h5><p id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-idm247131280">All of the sentences that develop the paragraph should support or expand on the main point given in the topic sentence. Depending on the type of writing you are doing, support may include evidence from sources—such as facts, statistics, and expert opinions—as well as examples from your own experience.</p>
<p id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-idm239795728">Paragraphs also may include an analysis of your evidence, written in your own words. The analysis explains the significance of the evidence for the reader and reinforces the main point of the paragraph. </p><p id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-303">In the following example, the topic sentence is underlined. The supporting evidence comes in the next three sentences. The paragraph concludes with two sentences of analysis in the writer’s own words. </p>
<blockquote id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-idm272641328"><p id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-idm268230656"><u data-effect="underline">Millions of retired Americans rely on Social Security benefits to make ends meet after they turn 65.</u> According to the Social Security Administration, about 46 million retired workers receive benefits, a number that reflects about 90 percent of retired people. Although experts disagree on the exact numbers, somewhere between 12 percent and 40 percent of retirees count on social security for all of their income, making these benefits especially important (Konish). Even more, these benefits become more important as people age. According to Eisenberg, people who reach the age of 85 become more financially vulnerable because their health care and long-term care costs increase at the same time their savings have been drawn down. It should therefore come as no surprise that people worry about changes to the program. Social Security keeps millions of retired Americans out of poverty. </p></blockquote></section><section data-depth="3" id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-748"><h5 data-type="title">Opening Paragraphs</h5><p id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-168">
Readers pay attention to the opening, so make it work for you. After starting with a descriptive title, write an opening paragraph that grabs readers’ attention and alerts them to what’s coming. A strong opening paragraph provides the first clues about your subject and your take on it. Depending on the type of writing you’re doing, you can open in a variety of ways.
</p><ul id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-599"><li><strong>Open with the thesis.</strong> Academic writing, whether argumentative, interpretative, or informative, commonly opens with a clear thesis statement that the rest of the paper will support. Often the thesis statement comes at the end of the introduction. </li>
<li><strong>Open with a conflict.</strong> If you’re writing about conflict, a good opening may be to spell out what the conflict is. This way of opening captures attention by creating a kind of suspense: <em data-effect="italics">Will the conflict be resolved? How will it be resolved?</em> </li>
<li><strong>Open with a story.</strong> Readers enjoy stories. Particularly for reflective or personal narrative writing, beginning with a story sets the scene and draws in readers. </li>
<li><strong>Open with a specific detail, statistic, or quotation.</strong> Specific information shows that you know a lot about your subject and piques readers’ curiosity. The more dramatic your information, the more it will draw in readers, as long as what you provide is credible. </li>
</ul></section><section data-depth="3" id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-284"><h5 data-type="title">Closing Paragraphs</h5><p id="auto_2075f23e-ddf7-4a36-84dc-7d988ec136c6_eip-439">
The conclusion is your final chance to make the point of your writing stick in readers’ minds by reinforcing what they have read. You can summarize your main point and restate your thesis, draw a logical conclusion, speculate about the issues you have raised, or recommend further action.

<strong>Transitional words and phrases</strong> show the connections between sentences and paragraphs and help your writing flow smoothly from one idea to the next.

A paragraph flows when ideas are organized logically and sentences move smoothly from one to the next. Transitional words and phrases help your writing flow by signaling to readers what’s coming in the next sentence. In the paragraph below, the topic sentence and transitional words and phrases are underlined.
