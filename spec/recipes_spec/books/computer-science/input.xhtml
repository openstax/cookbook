The <em data-effect="italics">Introduction to Computer Science</em> textbook will realize its vision through a practical approach that focuses on the conceptual capabilities computer science provides to help build technical solutions to business problems. Manual business or social solutions typically involve processes that are applied by people at one or more locations. For example, the selling of insurance policies used to be delegated solely to insurance agents who met with customers in order to issue quotes and bind policies. Computer science has helped automate and replace manual solutions to business problems via information systems composed of applications that create or manipulate data and operate on top of technical infrastructures. Most insurance companies today have sophisticated websites that act as insurance portals where customers can obtain quotes and insurance policies on their own. When teaching intricate technical topics (such as Computer Systems Organization) that students are approaching for the first time, being able to relate to practical solutions is important to ensure that students remain engaged in the classroom and are able to identify real-world opportunities where this knowledge can be applied.
</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_5c1f0124-75ae-40e3-bd36-ff2bd10bbb6d_eip-69"><h4 data-type="title">A foundation and a bridge</h4><p id="auto_5c1f0124-75ae-40e3-bd36-ff2bd10bbb6d_eip-448">Many introductory texts in this discipline do not provide a straightforward path across the various underlying areas that make up the field. <em data-effect="italics">Introduction to Computer Science</em> will stand out by looking at the various areas as conceptual capabilities or building blocks and assembling them as a sequence that empowers students with a clear vision of computer science at the start of their academic studies. This foundation will be paired with the practical and solution-based approach highlighted across the book via chapter scenarios, features showcasing real-world examples and issues, and assessments that ask students to apply computational thinking to relevant and relatable problems.
</p><p id="auto_5c1f0124-75ae-40e3-bd36-ff2bd10bbb6d_eip-1000">It is also essential that the text integrate with other courses in computer science that students will take. These courses include (at the very least) Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Systems Organization, Operating Systems, Data Communications and Networks, Programming Languages, Database Systems, Software Engineering, Web Applications Development, Cloud Computing, and Society and Computer Science. Introduction to Computer Science will cover the material at a preliminary level so that students can gain additional knowledge as they take these more advanced courses. For non-majors, the resource will set the pace for a practical introduction to computer science that provides them with examples of how computational thinking can help them solve daily practical problems to prepare them for workforce experience. A goal of the book is that students—both majors and non-majors—will engage in activities and assessments that enable them to create artifacts of value that can be used to build career confidence. For example, learned skills should be relatable and translatable to opportunities with prospective employers and internship providers.</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_5c1f0124-75ae-40e3-bd36-ff2bd10bbb6d_eip-464"><h4 data-type="title">Currency</h4><p id="auto_5c1f0124-75ae-40e3-bd36-ff2bd10bbb6d_eip-680">
Many of the core topics of an introductory computer science course will not change drastically over the next several years, but it is important that the resource be designed to evolve as technology progresses. For example, a transition to neuromorphic computing or quantum computing in the future could drastically affect topics such as Computer Systems Organization, Operating Systems, Data Communications, and Networks. However, progress in these upcoming areas is fairly slow and can be addressed through incremental changes via maintenance or mini updates. With faster evolution, the use of Machine Learning at various levels will keep growing and the material will need to address this evolution. It is likely that the material will be best taught in the future via a flipped classroom environment due to the growing variety of topics being covered and the need to work on practical problems with students to maximize their learning. A textbook structure that allows for regular mini updates, plus companion tools such as a playground environment, will facilitate a resource that is adaptable to evolving technologies as well as resulting shifts in how the material is taught.

The iBackPack boasted capabilities to incorporate WiFi/MiFi, a 20,000 main battery system, smart power transfer cables, and a car-charging system in addition to the ability to carry four notebook computers and the related accessories. Monahan promised it would deliver a “communication hub and corresponding electrical powerhouse for students and business professionals alike.”

An additional $76,694 was raised from 252 backers through Kickstarter. By 2017, years since its start, the iBackPack crowdfunding campaign that began with great promise failed to deliver the product promised to its investors. Fast forward to 2016.

This could be an ethical dilemma related to the use of technology, or an error, with the “think it through” portion being to determine the impact and/or how to correct. The purpose is to teach students that, in the real world, many decisions are judgment calls and not every question has just one answer. This feature is ripe for incorporating how technology impacts all areas of the business; for instance, the scenario could be one that impacts Sales, HR or Marketing in a given company. Writers should supply an answer that will appear in the Solutions Manual (“Student answers may vary but should include ABC or XYZ”). This is the scenario part of the feature box. You have access to Wireshark and need to analyze packets being sent between a local application and a remote server.

The primary difference, however, between losses and expenses again relates to the primary purpose of the organization. While expenses represent a decrease in organizational value from providing goods and services, losses represent a decrease in organizational value from activities that are <em data-effect="italics">“incidental or peripheral”</em> (SFAC No. 6, p. 24) to the primary purpose of the business. Let’s return to our local coffee shop example. Now assume the coffee shop sold the espresso machine for less (a more likely scenario) than it paid for the machine. Would the coffee shop be less valuable after this transaction than before it? Yes it would, because the value of the coffee shop decreased by an amount greater than the cash it received. But how should the accountant classify this transaction?

The CEO has several direct report units: Financing, Production, Information Technology, Marketing, Human Resources, and Maintenance. Each unit has a director responsible for several departments. The organizational chart also shows the departments that report to the production unit director and gives an indication as to the production arrangement. Raw materials are stored in the materials storeroom and delivered to the production department. The design department uses direct labor to create the design specifications and when completed, sends them to the production department. The production department uses the material and design specifications and adds even more labor to create the sign. The sign is transferred to the Finishing Department for final materials and labor before the sign is installed or delivered to the customer.

This principle requires the costs to be expensed when they match the revenue being earned; and separating the costs of production from the other costs results in the proper timing recognition of expenses. Period costs are expensed during the period in which they are incurred and this policy matches administrative and other expenses shown on the income statement in the same period in which the company earns income.

If the products are not sold, the costs remain in ending inventory. When the products are sold, the cost of the inventory becomes the cost of goods sold and is expensed on the income statement.

<p id="auto_b4d3e3d4-6d81-4706-a4cd-eef55d8e6059_eip-608">Generally there are three categories of costs included in the manufacturing processes: <span data-type="term">direct materials</span>, <span data-type="term">direct labor</span>, and <span data-type="term">overhead</span>. This is only a generalization since there are some service industries that do not have direct material, and there are some automated manufacturing companies that do not have direct labor.
</p><p id="auto_b4d3e3d4-6d81-4706-a4cd-eef55d8e6059_eip-97">To illustrate the components of product costs in a <span data-type="term">job order costing system</span>, consider that Mac’s &amp; Cheese restaurant hires Dinosaur Vinyl, Inc. (DV) to manufacture the sign by the stadium. In the sign manufacturing process, materials are moved from raw materials inventory to the Production Department where the sign is printed.  When printing is complete, the sign is moved to the Finishing Department where more material is added to frame the sign before it is transferred to the Finished Goods Department. The costs are tracked and move at the same time as the actual sign.  When Mac’s &amp; Cheese has completed its production contract and the sale is complete; the costs are moved to Cost of Goods Sold.

<span data-type="term">Direct materials</span> are the materials that can be directly traced to the product.  A company needs inventory on hand to help customers quickly so there is usually some inventory on hand in the raw materials inventory account.  The material is sent to the production department when the material will be put into production.

The primary difference, however, between losses and expenses again relates to the primary purpose of the organization. While expenses represent a decrease in organizational value from providing goods and services, losses represent a decrease in organizational value from activities that are “<em data-effect="italics">incidental</em> or <em data-effect="italics">peripheral</em>” (SFAC No. 6, p. 24) to the primary purpose of the business. Let’s return to our local coffee shop example. Now assume the coffee shop sold the espresso machine for less (a more likely scenario) than it paid for the machine. Would the coffee shop be less valuable after this transaction than before it? Yes it would, because the value of the coffee shop decreased by an amount greater than the cash it received. But how should the accountant classify this transaction? </p>

The typical billboard sign is 14 feet high by 48 feet wide and DV incurs a vinyl cost of $300 per billboard.  The price for the ink varies by color.  For this job, DV needs: two units of black ink at a cost of $85 each, one unit of red ink and one unit of gold ink with a cost of $55 each, twelve grommets with a cost of $10 each, and forty units of wood at a cost of $1.50 per unit.

For example, a furniture factory classified the cost of glue, stain and nails as indirect materials. Nails are often used in furniture production; however, one chair may need 15 nails while another needs 18 nails. At a cost of less than one cent per nail, it is not worth keeping track of each nail.  It is much more practical to track how many pounds of nails were used for the period and allocate this cost (along with other costs) to the overhead costs of the products finished.

<p id="auto_b4d3e3d4-6d81-4706-a4cd-eef55d8e6059_fs-idm207576928">You might think of expenses as the opposite of revenue. Expenses are the costs of providing the goods or services. Expenses are formally defined as “outflows or other using up of assets or incurrences of liabilities (or a combination of both) from delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or carrying out other activities that constitute the entity’s ongoing major or central operations” (SFAC No. 6, p. 23). In other words, expenses decrease the value of the organization because the organization incurs a cost in providing goods or services.

What does it take to manufacture the sign outside the stadium? It starts with the production department requisitioning vinyl and ink from the raw materials inventory.  Once the raw materials are delivered to the production department, the product is considered work-in-process inventory. There, <span data-type="term">direct labor</span> is used to place the material into the printer, align the computerized design, and have it printed on the vinyl.  The direct materials and direct labor are known and recorded on the job order cost sheet. When the Production Department has completed its work, the sign and the job order cost sheet are transferred to the Finishing Department. This department requests wood for framing and grommets for attaching the sign from raw materials inventory.  This department adds direct labor, wood, and grommets to the already printed sign to finish it properly.

Beginning with the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, the world was plunged into war and the events that followed were horrifically absurd. All of the modern inventions and the spread of democratic institutions did not stop the bloody hell of trench warfare. People were more willing to question the authority of elites and religious leaders as they could be of little help once war began. Historians became more interested in the irrational aspects of the human condition, the psychology behind one’s choices. </p><p id="auto_b4d3e3d4-6d81-4706-a4cd-eef55d8e6059_eip-606">The counterculture of the 1960s deepened the desire to challenge existing norms. As students protested the Viet Nam war, the lack of Civil Rights, and the closed-mindedness of the previous generation, young historians developed new ideas. In their 1966 book, <em data-effect="italics">The Social Construction of Reality</em>, Peter Burger and Thomas Luckman argued our belief systems are informed by social constructs, the way society tells us to think and behave. Consider our first thought exercise. You believe education is important. Why? Who has said that to you in the past? How did you come to believe it? These constructs exist everywhere and they inform many decisions that we make, often on a subconscious level.  </p>

For example, if you want to develop an entrepreneurial vision in the next 3 months, then you should have some goals that relate to how much of the vision should be completed in week 1, week 2, week 3 and so on.

Process Costing is the optimal system when the production process is continuous and it is difficult to trace a particular input cost with a specific individual product. Process costing systems assign costs to each department as the costs are incurred. The costs to produce one unit is calculated based on the information from the production departments. The focus of process costing systems is on measuring and assigning the conversion costs to the proper department so the cost of the individual units can be determined.

Let us look at one more example. This time it will be the broader topic of Colonial Latin America, between the Spanish conquest and the independence movements of the 1820s. How would each school of thought approach the topic? The progressive historian might look at the growth of democratic legal systems or the increase in interest in republican forms of government. The intellectual historian might consider the literature and philosophy of the period. The social historian would look at things like what people ate, how they worked, what they looked for in marriage partners. A communist historian would look at issues of unfair labor practices and moments of class conflict like rebellion or riot. The feminist historian would investigate the great power differential that existed in this highly patriarchal society. And the post-colonialist would highlight aspects of colonialism that would remain impactful after independence. All of these interpretative elements help us weave together a more complete picture of the past as will future efforts to enhance our understanding.

While the product is in production, the direct material and direct labor costs assigned so far are included in work in progress inventory.

When the job is completed, the total cost of the job: the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are totaled and transferred to finished goods at the same time the physical product is transferred.

Dinosaur Vinyl worked on three jobs during the month. POR143 was already in work in progress inventory with $1,000 in direct material costs. There wasn’t any direct labor as the material was received by production at the end of the month. During the current month, additional materials of $200, and $150 of direct labor were added to POR143. Overhead of $375 was applied to POR143 at the predetermined overhead rate of $2.50 per direct labor dollar. WW-test of MathType.

<li>Explain that while using decimal notation (i.e., base 10) is natural for 10-fingered humans, binary values are better when building machines that store and process information. </li>
<li>This is due to the fact that two-valued signals can readily be represented, stored, and transmitted (e.g., presence or absence of a hole in a punched card, high or low voltage on a wire, magnetic domain oriented clockwise or counterclockwise). </li>
<li>The electronic circuitry required to store and perform computations on two-valued signals is very simple and reliable as manufacturers can integrate billions of such circuits on a single silicon chip using nanotechnology.</li>

  <p id="auto_6f2e1cb9-9e82-40a4-9b3d-6143ad421e4d_eip-736">WW-test notes that this appendix content includes index terms (length, mass, time), tables, tables with captions, a figure, an image, a footnote, centered text, one very long header, and LO icons. In the American system of measurement (originally developed in England), the fundamental units of length, weight, and time are the foot, pound, and second, respectively. There are also larger and smaller units, which include the ton (2240 lb), the mile (5280 ft), the rod (16 1/2 ft), the yard (3 ft), the inch (1/12 ft), the ounce (1/16 lb), and so on. Such units, whose origins in decisions by British royalty have been forgotten by most people, are quite inconvenient for conversion or doing calculations.</p><p id="auto_6f2e1cb9-9e82-40a4-9b3d-6143ad421e4d_eip-958">Calculations can be centered WW-test without MathType<span data-type="newline"><br /></span>

<strong class="centered-text">In science, therefore, it is more usual to use the <em data-effect="italics">metric system</em>, which has been adopted in virtually all countries except the United States. Its great advantage is that every unit increases by a factor of ten, instead of the strange factors in the American system. The fundamental units of the metric system are:</strong>

<li><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">mass</span>: 1 kilogram (kg)</li>

</li></ul><p id="auto_6f2e1cb9-9e82-40a4-9b3d-6143ad421e4d_eip-394">A meter was originally intended to be 1 ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along the surface of Earth. It is about 1.1 yd. A kilogram is the mass that on Earth results in a weight of about 2.2 lb. The second is the same in metric and American units as shown in <a href="#auto_6f2e1cb9-9e82-40a4-9b3d-6143ad421e4d_Figure00_AA_TestFigure" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

Although we don't make the distinction very carefully in everyday life on Earth, strictly speaking the kilogram is a unit of mass (measuring the quantity of matter in a body, roughly how many atoms it has) while the pound is a unit of weight (measuring how strongly Earth's gravity pulls on a body).

<li>Kelvin or absolute (K); water freezes at 273 K and boils at 373 K.
</li></ul><p id="auto_6f2e1cb9-9e82-40a4-9b3d-6143ad421e4d_eip-721">All molecular motion ceases at about –459 °F = –273 °C = 0 K, a temperature called <em data-effect="italics">absolute zero</em>. Kelvin temperature is measured from this lowest possible temperature, and it is the temperature scale most often used in astronomy. Kelvins have the same value as centigrade or Celsius degrees, since the difference between the freezing and boiling points of water is 100 degrees in each. (Note that we just say “Kelvins,” not Kelvin degrees.) </p><p id="auto_6f2e1cb9-9e82-40a4-9b3d-6143ad421e4d_eip-774">On the Fahrenheit scale, the difference between the freezing and boiling points of water is 180 degrees. Thus, to convert Celsius degrees or Kelvins to Fahrenheit degrees, it is necessary to multiply by 180/100 = 9/5. To convert from Fahrenheit degrees to Celsius degrees or Kelvins, it is necessary to multiply by 100/180 = 5/9.</p></section>
