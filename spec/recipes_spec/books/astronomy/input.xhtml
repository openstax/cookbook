<p id="auto_b795b4f7-3318-4419-a338-8f5eeb0874ee_fs-id1163975413245">Because our books are openly licensed, you are free to use the entire book or pick and choose the sections that are most relevant to the needs of your course. Feel free to remix the content by assigning your students certain chapters and sections in your syllabus, in the order that you prefer. You can even provide a direct link in your syllabus to the sections in the web view of your book.</p>
<p id="auto_b795b4f7-3318-4419-a338-8f5eeb0874ee_fs-id1168584325502">Instructors also have the option of creating a customized version of their OpenStax book.

Since our books are web based, we can make updates periodically when deemed pedagogically necessary. If you have a correction to suggest, submit it through the link on your book page on OpenStax.org.

It has many analogies drawn from everyday life to help non-science majors appreciate, on their own terms, what our modern exploration of the universe is revealing. The book can be used for either a one-semester or two-semester introductory course (bear in mind, you can customize your version and include only those chapters or sections you will be teaching.) It is made available free of charge in electronic form (and low cost in printed form) to students around the world. If you have ever thrown up your hands in despair over the spiraling cost of astronomy textbooks, you owe your students a good look at this one.</p>

The discussion of exoplanets has been updated with recent information—indicating not just individual examples, but trends in what sorts of planets seem to be most common. Black holes receive their own chapter, and the role of supermassive black holes in active galaxies and galaxy evolution is clearly explained. Chapters have been reviewed by subject-matter experts for accuracy and currency.</p>

Math examples are shown in separate sections throughout, so that you can leave out the math or require it as you deem best. Each section of a chapter treats a different aspect of the topic being covered; a number of sections could be omitted in shorter overview courses and can be included where you need more depth. And, as we have already discussed, you can customize the book in a variety of ways that have never been possible in traditional textbooks.</p>

   <div data-type="document-title" id="auto_c2150b0b-4881-42c7-83b2-ad766c79d36a_0">The Nature of Science</div>

<p id="auto_c2150b0b-4881-42c7-83b2-ad766c79d36a_fs-id1167470762209">The ultimate judge in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">science</span> is always what nature itself reveals based on observations, experiments, models, and testing. Science is not merely a body of knowledge, but a <em data-effect="italics">method</em> by which we attempt to understand nature and how it behaves. This method begins with many observations over a period of time. From the trends found through observations, scientists can <em data-effect="italics">model</em> the particular phenomena we want to understand. Such models are always approximations of nature, subject to further testing.</p>

<p id="auto_c2150b0b-4881-42c7-83b2-ad766c79d36a_fs-id1167467389554">As a concrete astronomical example, ancient astronomers constructed a model (partly from observations and partly from philosophical beliefs) that Earth was the center of the universe and everything moved around it in circular orbits. At first, our available observations of the Sun, Moon, and planets did fit this model; however, after further observations, the model had to be updated by adding circle after circle to represent the movements of the planets around Earth at the center. As the centuries passed and improved instruments were developed for keeping track of objects in the sky, the old model (even with a huge number of circles) could no longer explain all the observed facts. As we will see in the chapter on <a href="#page_5669c796-2b05-4a8f-96ac-85939b9b32af">Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy</a>, a new model, with the Sun at the center, fit the experimental evidence better. After a period of philosophical struggle, it became accepted as our view of the universe.</p>

<p id="auto_c2150b0b-4881-42c7-83b2-ad766c79d36a_fs-id1167467456155">When they are first proposed, new models or ideas are sometimes called <em data-effect="italics">hypotheses</em>. You may think there can be no new hypotheses in a science such as astronomy—that everything important has already been learned. Nothing could be further from the truth. Throughout this textbook you will find discussions of recent, and occasionally still controversial, hypotheses in astronomy. For example, the significance that the huge chunks of rock and ice that hit Earth have for life on Earth itself is still debated. And while the evidence is strong that vast quantities of invisible “dark energy” make up the bulk of the universe, scientists have no convincing explanation for what the dark energy actually is. Resolving these issues will require difficult observations done at the forefront of our technology, and all such hypotheses need further testing before we incorporate them fully into our standard astronomical models.</p>

<p id="auto_c2150b0b-4881-42c7-83b2-ad766c79d36a_fs-id1167467660330">This last point is crucial: a hypothesis must be a proposed explanation that can be <em data-effect="italics">tested</em>. The most straightforward approach to such testing in science is to perform an experiment. If the experiment is conducted properly, its results either will agree with the predictions of the hypothesis or they will contradict it. If the experimental result is truly inconsistent with the hypothesis, a scientist must discard the hypothesis and try to develop an alternative. If the experimental result agrees with predictions, this does not necessarily prove that the hypothesis is absolutely correct; perhaps later experiments will contradict crucial parts of the hypothesis. But, the more experiments that agree with the hypothesis, the more likely we are to accept the hypothesis as a useful description of nature.</p>

<p id="auto_c2150b0b-4881-42c7-83b2-ad766c79d36a_fs-id1167470545488">One way to think about this is to consider a scientist who was born and lives on an island where only black sheep live. Day after day the scientist encounters black sheep only, so he or she hypothesizes that all sheep are black. Although every observed sheep adds confidence to the hypothesis, the scientist only has to visit the mainland and observe one white sheep to prove the hypothesis wrong.</p>

<p id="auto_c2150b0b-4881-42c7-83b2-ad766c79d36a_fs-id1167470565337">When you read about experiments, you probably have a mental picture of a scientist in a laboratory conducting tests or taking careful measurements. This is certainly the case for a biologist or a chemist, but what can astronomers do when our laboratory is the universe? It’s impossible to put a group of stars into a test tube or to order another comet from a scientific supply company.</p>

<p id="auto_c2150b0b-4881-42c7-83b2-ad766c79d36a_fs-id1167470700557">As a result, astronomy is sometimes called an <em data-effect="italics">observational</em> science; we often make our tests by observing many samples of the kind of object we want to study and noting carefully how different samples vary. New instruments and technology can let us look at astronomical objects from new perspectives and in greater detail. Our hypotheses are then judged in the light of this new information, and they pass or fail in the same way we would evaluate the result of a laboratory experiment.</p>

<p id="auto_c2150b0b-4881-42c7-83b2-ad766c79d36a_fs-id1167470898808">Much of astronomy is also a <em data-effect="italics">historical</em> science—meaning that what we observe has already happened in the universe and we can do nothing to change it. In the same way, a geologist cannot alter what has happened to our planet, and a paleontologist cannot bring an ancient animal back to life. While this can make astronomy challenging, it also gives us fascinating opportunities to discover the secrets of our cosmic past.</p>

<p id="auto_c2150b0b-4881-42c7-83b2-ad766c79d36a_fs-id1167470861363">You might compare an astronomer to a detective trying to solve a crime that occurred before the detective arrived at the scene. There is lots of evidence, but both the detective and the scientist must sift through and organize the evidence to test various hypotheses about what actually happened. And there is another way in which the scientist is like a detective: they both must prove their case. The detective must convince the district attorney, the judge, and perhaps ultimately the jury that his hypothesis is correct. Similarly, the scientist must convince colleagues, editors of journals, and ultimately a broad cross-section of other scientists that her hypothesis is provisionally correct. In both cases, one can only ask for evidence “beyond a reasonable doubt.” And sometimes new evidence will force both the detective and the scientist to revise their last hypothesis.</p>

<p id="auto_c2150b0b-4881-42c7-83b2-ad766c79d36a_fs-id1167471083067">This self-correcting aspect of science sets it off from most human activities. Scientists spend a great deal of time questioning and challenging one another, which is why applications for project funding—as well as reports for publication in academic journals—go through an extensive process of <em data-effect="italics">peer review</em>, which is a careful examination by other scientists in the same field. In science (after formal education and training), everyone is encouraged to improve upon experiments and to challenge any and all hypotheses. New scientists know that one of the best ways to advance their careers is to find a weakness in our current understanding of something and to correct it with a new or modified hypothesis.</p>

<p id="auto_c2150b0b-4881-42c7-83b2-ad766c79d36a_fs-id1167470665280">This is one of the reasons science has made such dramatic progress. An undergraduate science major today knows more about science and math than did Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most renowned scientists who ever lived. Even in this introductory astronomy course, you will learn about objects and processes that no one a few generations ago even dreamed existed.</p>

   <div data-type="document-title" id="auto_8b5ce726-e912-4fcd-aacf-e35aaafb9839_0">The Laws of Nature</div>

<p id="auto_8b5ce726-e912-4fcd-aacf-e35aaafb9839_fs-id1167470665280">Over centuries scientists have extracted various <em data-effect="italics">scientific laws</em> from countless observations, hypotheses, and experiments. These scientific laws are, in a sense, the “rules” of the game that nature plays. One remarkable discovery about nature—one that underlies everything you will read about in this text—is that the same laws apply everywhere in the universe. The rules that determine the motion of stars so far away that your eye cannot see them are the same laws that determine the arc of a baseball after a batter has hit it out of the park.</p>

<p id="auto_8b5ce726-e912-4fcd-aacf-e35aaafb9839_fs-id1167470761758">Note that without the existence of such universal laws, we could not make much headway in astronomy. If each pocket of the universe had different rules, we would have little chance of interpreting what happened in other “neighborhoods.” But, the consistency of the laws of nature gives us enormous power to understand distant objects without traveling to them and learning the local laws. In the same way, if every region of a country had completely different laws, it would be very difficult to carry out commerce or even to understand the behavior of people in those different regions. A consistent set of laws, though, allows us to apply what we learn or practice in one state to any other state.</p>

<p id="auto_8b5ce726-e912-4fcd-aacf-e35aaafb9839_fs-id1167470606975">This is not to say that our current scientific models and laws cannot change. New experiments and observations can lead to new, more sophisticated models—models that can include new phenomena and laws about their behavior. The general theory of relativity proposed by Albert Einstein is a perfect example of such a transformation that took place about a century ago; it led us to predict, and eventually to observe, a strange new class of objects that astronomers call <em data-effect="italics">black holes</em>. Only the patient process of observing nature ever more carefully and precisely can demonstrate the validity of such new scientific models.</p>

<p id="auto_8b5ce726-e912-4fcd-aacf-e35aaafb9839_fs-id1167470762302">One important problem in describing scientific models has to do with the limitations of language. When we try to describe complex phenomena in everyday terms, the words themselves may not be adequate to do the job. For example, you may have heard the structure of the atom likened to a miniature solar system. While some aspects of our modern model of the atom do remind us of planetary orbits, many other of its aspects are fundamentally different.</p>

<p id="auto_8b5ce726-e912-4fcd-aacf-e35aaafb9839_fs-id1167467242484">This problem is the reason scientists often prefer to describe their models using equations rather than words. In this book, which is designed to introduce the field of astronomy, we use mainly words to discuss what scientists have learned. We avoid complex math, but if this course piques your interest and you go on in science, more and more of your studies will involve the precise language of mathematics.</p>

<p id="auto_6d1abd05-a7d8-44c0-acd0-b5b97b3f771b_fs-id1167470976282">In astronomy we deal with distances on a scale you may never have thought about before, with numbers larger than any you may have encountered. We adopt two approaches that make dealing with astronomical numbers a little bit easier. First, we use a system for writing large and small numbers called <em data-effect="italics">scientific notation</em> (or sometimes <em data-effect="italics">powers-of-ten notation</em>). This system is very appealing because it eliminates the many zeros that can seem overwhelming to the reader. In scientific notation, if you want to write a number such as 500,000,000, you express it as 5 × 10<sup>8</sup>. The small raised number after the 10, called an <em data-effect="italics">exponent</em>, keeps track of the number of places we had to move the decimal point to the left to convert 500,000,000 to 5. If you are encountering this system for the first time or would like a refresher, we suggest you look at <a href="#page_b51ff343-f72e-4d3d-b1ff-d91fc7b22490">Appendix C</a> and <a href="#auto_6d1abd05-a7d8-44c0-acd0-b5b97b3f771b_fs-id1167471064677" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> for more information. The second way we try to keep numbers simple is to use a consistent set of units—the metric International System of Units, or SI (from the French <em data-effect="italics">Système International d’Unités</em>). The metric system is summarized in <a href="#page_fde24489-0317-41c9-83ee-eb6de6224ea0">Appendix D</a> (see <a href="#auto_6d1abd05-a7d8-44c0-acd0-b5b97b3f771b_fs-id1167471073554" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p><div data-type="note" id="auto_6d1abd05-a7d8-44c0-acd0-b5b97b3f771b_fs-id1167470809352" class="astronomy link-to-learning">

</div>

<p id="auto_6d1abd05-a7d8-44c0-acd0-b5b97b3f771b_fs-id1167470706505">A common unit astronomers use to describe distances in the universe is a light-year, which is the distance light travels during one year. Because light always travels at the same speed, and because its speed turns out to be the fastest possible speed in the universe, it makes a good standard for keeping track of distances. You might be confused because a “light-year” seems to imply that we are measuring time, but this mix-up of time and distance is common in everyday life as well. For example, when your friend asks where the movie theater is located, you might say “about 20 minutes from downtown.”</p>

<p id="auto_6d1abd05-a7d8-44c0-acd0-b5b97b3f771b_fs-id1167470753198">So, how many kilometers are there in a light-year? Light travels at the amazing pace of 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> kilometers per second (km/s), which makes a light-year 9.46 × 10<sup>12</sup> kilometers. You might think that such a large unit would reach the nearest star easily, but the stars are far more remote than our imaginations might lead us to believe. Even the nearest star is 4.3 light-years away—more than 40 trillion kilometers. Other stars visible to the unaided eye are hundreds to thousands of light-years away (<a href="#auto_6d1abd05-a7d8-44c0-acd0-b5b97b3f771b_OSC_Astro_01_04_Nebula" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

Light travels 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> km in 1 s. So, let’s calculate how far it goes in a year:</p>
<ul id="auto_6d1abd05-a7d8-44c0-acd0-b5b97b3f771b_fs-id1167470671648" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>There are 60 (6 × 10<sup>1</sup>) s in 1 min, and 6 × 10<sup>1</sup> min in 1 h.</li>
<li>Multiply these together and you find that there are 3.6 × 10<sup>3</sup> s/h.</li>
<li>Thus, light covers 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> km/s × 3.6 × 10<sup>3</sup> s/h = 1.08 × 10<sup>9</sup> km/h.</li>
<li>There are 24 or 2.4 × 10<sup>1</sup> h in a day, and 365.25 (3.65 × 10<sup>2</sup>) days in 1 y.</li>
<li>The product of these two numbers is 8.77 × 10<sup>3</sup> h/y.</li>
<li>Multiplying this by 1.08 × 10<sup>9</sup> km/h gives 9.46 × 10<sup>12</sup> km/light-year.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_6d1abd05-a7d8-44c0-acd0-b5b97b3f771b_fs-id1167470700759">That’s almost 10,000,000,000,000 km that light covers in a year. To help you imagine how long this distance is, we’ll mention that a string 1 light-year long could fit around the circumference of Earth 236 million times.</p>

   <div data-type="document-title" id="auto_72f7108d-f806-4f54-80ac-eed5976266e2_0">Consequences of Light Travel Time</div>

<p id="auto_72f7108d-f806-4f54-80ac-eed5976266e2_fs-id1167471026413">There is another reason the speed of light is such a natural unit of distance for astronomers. Information about the universe comes to us almost exclusively through various forms of light, and all such light travels at the speed of light—that is, 1 light-year every year. This sets a limit on how quickly we can learn about events in the universe. If a star is 100 light-years away, the light we see from it tonight left that star 100 years ago and is just now arriving in our neighborhood. The soonest we can learn about any changes in that star is 100 years after the fact. For a star 500 light-years away, the light we detect tonight left 500 years ago and is carrying 500-year-old news.</p>

<p id="auto_72f7108d-f806-4f54-80ac-eed5976266e2_fs-id1167471071669">Because many of us are accustomed to instant news from the Internet, some might find this frustrating.</p>

<p id="auto_72f7108d-f806-4f54-80ac-eed5976266e2_fs-id1167466083098">“You mean, when I see that star up there,” you ask, “I won’t know what’s actually happening there for another 500 years?”</p>

<p id="auto_72f7108d-f806-4f54-80ac-eed5976266e2_fs-id1167470591403">But this isn’t the most helpful way to think about the situation. For astronomers, <em data-effect="italics">now</em> is when the light reaches us here on Earth. There is no way for us to know anything about that star (or other object) until its light reaches us.</p>

<p id="auto_72f7108d-f806-4f54-80ac-eed5976266e2_fs-id1167470940707">But what at first may seem a great frustration is actually a tremendous benefit in disguise. If astronomers really want to piece together what has happened in the universe since its beginning, they must find evidence about each epoch (or period of time) of the past. Where can we find evidence today about cosmic events that occurred billions of years ago?</p>

<p id="auto_72f7108d-f806-4f54-80ac-eed5976266e2_fs-id1167467337229">The delay in the arrival of light provides an answer to this question. The farther out in space we look, the longer the light has taken to get here, and the longer ago it left its place of origin. By looking billions of light-years out into space, astronomers are actually seeing billions of years into the past. In this way, we can reconstruct the history of the cosmos and get a sense of how it has evolved over time.</p>

<p id="auto_72f7108d-f806-4f54-80ac-eed5976266e2_fs-id1167470941279">This is one reason why astronomers strive to build telescopes that can collect more and more of the faint light in the universe. The more light we collect, the fainter the objects we can observe. On average, fainter objects are farther away and can, therefore, tell us about periods of time even deeper in the past. Instruments such as the Hubble Space Telescope (<a href="#auto_72f7108d-f806-4f54-80ac-eed5976266e2_OSC_Astro_01_05_Orbit" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) and the Very Large Telescope in Chile (which you will learn about in the chapter on <a href="#page_bd9d6fca-fd83-4112-9379-482f40364ae7">Astronomical Instruments</a>), are giving astronomers views of deep space and deep time better than any we have had before.</p>

<p id="auto_206e426a-3d8f-4832-80dd-189b03869a34_fs-id1167467382746">We can now take a brief introductory tour of the universe as astronomers understand it today to get acquainted with the types of objects and distances you will encounter throughout the text. We begin at home with Earth, a nearly spherical planet about 13,000 kilometers in diameter (<a href="#auto_206e426a-3d8f-4832-80dd-189b03869a34_OSC_Astro_01_06_Planet" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). A space traveler entering our planetary system would easily distinguish Earth from the other planets in our solar system by the large amount of liquid water that covers some two thirds of its crust. If the traveler had equipment to receive radio or television signals, or came close enough to see the lights of our cities at night, she would soon find signs that this watery planet has sentient life.</p>

Notice how small we have to make these bodies to fit them on the page with the right scale. The Moon’s distance from Earth is about 30 times Earth’s diameter, or approximately 384,000 kilometers, and it takes about a month for the Moon to revolve around Earth. The Moon’s diameter is 3476 kilometers, about one fourth the size of Earth.</p>

<p id="auto_206e426a-3d8f-4832-80dd-189b03869a34_fs-id1167471064197">Light (or radio waves) takes 1.3 seconds to travel between Earth and the Moon. If you’ve seen videos of the Apollo flights to the Moon, you may recall that there was a delay of about 3 seconds between the time Mission Control asked a question and the time the astronauts responded. This was not because the astronauts were thinking slowly, but rather because it took the radio waves almost 3 seconds to make the round trip.</p><p id="auto_206e426a-3d8f-4832-80dd-189b03869a34_fs-id1167467339783">Earth revolves around our star, the Sun, which is about 150 million kilometers away—approximately 400 times as far away from us as the Moon. We call the average Earth–Sun distance an <em data-effect="italics">astronomical unit</em> (AU) because, in the early days of astronomy, it was the most important measuring standard. Light takes slightly more than 8 minutes to travel 1 astronomical unit, which means the latest news we receive from the Sun is always 8 minutes old. The diameter of the Sun is about 1.5 million kilometers; Earth could fit comfortably inside one of the minor eruptions that occurs on the surface of our star. If the Sun were reduced to the size of a basketball, Earth would be a small apple seed about 30 meters from the ball.</p>

<p id="auto_206e426a-3d8f-4832-80dd-189b03869a34_fs-id1167470578714">It takes Earth 1 year (3 × 10<sup>7</sup> seconds) to go around the Sun at our distance; to make it around, we must travel at approximately 110,000 kilometers per hour. (If you, like many students, still prefer miles to kilometers, you might find the following trick helpful. To convert kilometers to miles, just multiply kilometers by 0.6. Thus, 110,000 kilometers per hour becomes 66,000 miles per hour.) Because gravity holds us firmly to Earth and there is no resistance to Earth’s motion in the vacuum of space, we participate in this extremely fast-moving trip without being aware of it day to day.</p>

<p id="auto_206e426a-3d8f-4832-80dd-189b03869a34_fs-id1167470602103">Earth is only one of eight planets that revolve around the Sun. These planets, along with their moons and swarms of smaller bodies such as dwarf planets, make up the solar system (<a href="#auto_206e426a-3d8f-4832-80dd-189b03869a34_OSC_Astro_01_06_Solar" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). A planet is defined as a body of significant size that orbits a star and does not produce its own light. (If a large body consistently produces its own light, it is then called a <em data-effect="italics">star</em>.) Later in the book this definition will be modified a bit, but it is perfectly fine for now as you begin your voyage.</p>

If the planets were much farther away, the tiny amount of light they reflect would usually not be visible to us. The planets we have so far discovered orbiting other stars were found from the pull their gravity exerts on their parent stars, or from the light they block from their stars when they pass in front of them. We can’t see most of these planets directly, although a few are now being imaged directly.</p>

We will discuss the processes that cause stars to shine in more detail later in the book. The other stars look faint only because they are so very far away. If we continue our basketball analogy, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Proxima Centauri</span>, the nearest star beyond the Sun, which is 4.3 light-years away, would be almost 7000 kilometers from the basketball.</p>

(When referring to the Milky Way, we capitalize <em data-effect="italics">Galaxy</em>; when talking about other galaxies of stars, we use lowercase <em data-effect="italics">galaxy</em>.) The Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars that make up the Galaxy; its extent, as we will see, staggers the human imagination. Within a sphere 10 light-years in radius centered on the Sun, we find roughly ten stars. Within a sphere 100 light-years in radius, there are roughly 10,000 (10<sup>4</sup>) stars—far too many to count or name—but we have still traversed only a tiny part of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Milky Way Galaxy</span>.

<p id="auto_206e426a-3d8f-4832-80dd-189b03869a34_fs-id1167470666982">Typically, the interstellar material is so extremely sparse that the space between stars is a much better vacuum than anything we can produce in terrestrial laboratories. Yet, the dust in space, building up over thousands of light-years, can block the light of more distant stars. Like the distant buildings that disappear from our view on a smoggy day in Los Angeles, the more distant regions of the Milky Way cannot be seen behind the layers of interstellar smog. Luckily, astronomers have found that stars and raw material shine with various forms of light, some of which do penetrate the smog, and so we have been able to develop a pretty good map of the Galaxy.</p>

<p id="auto_206e426a-3d8f-4832-80dd-189b03869a34_fs-id1167471047051">Recent observations, however, have also revealed a rather surprising and disturbing fact. There appears to be more—much more—to the Galaxy than meets the eye (or the telescope). From various investigations, we have evidence that much of our Galaxy is made of material we cannot currently observe directly with our instruments. We therefore call this component of the Galaxy <em data-effect="italics">dark matter</em>. We know the dark matter is there by the pull its gravity exerts on the stars and raw material we can observe, but what this dark matter is made of and how much of it exists remain a mystery. Furthermore, this dark matter is not confined to our Galaxy; it appears to be an important part of other star groupings as well.</p>

<p id="auto_206e426a-3d8f-4832-80dd-189b03869a34_fs-id1167470565184">By the way, not all stars live by themselves, as the Sun does. Many are born in double or triple systems with two, three, or more stars revolving about each other. Because the stars influence each other in such close systems, multiple stars allow us to measure characteristics that we cannot discern from observing single stars. In a number of places, enough stars have formed together that we recognized them as star clusters (<a href="#auto_206e426a-3d8f-4832-80dd-189b03869a34_OSC_Astro_01_06_Cluster" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Some of the largest of the star clusters that astronomers have cataloged contain hundreds of thousands of stars and take up volumes of space hundreds of light-years across.</p>

<p id="auto_206e426a-3d8f-4832-80dd-189b03869a34_fs-id1167470659918">You may hear stars referred to as “eternal,” but in fact no star can last forever. Since the “business” of stars is making energy, and energy production requires some sort of fuel to be used up, eventually all stars run out of fuel. This news should not cause you to panic, though, because our Sun still has at least 5 or 6 billion years to go. Ultimately, the Sun and all stars will die, and it is in their death throes that some of the most intriguing and important processes of the universe are revealed. For example, we now know that many of the atoms in our bodies were once inside stars. These stars exploded at the ends of their lives, recycling their material back into the reservoir of the Galaxy. In this sense, all of us are literally made of recycled “star dust.”</p>

   <div data-type="document-title" id="auto_abd4b491-1fd8-418f-8a46-c0c9f96df944_0">The Universe on the Large Scale</div>

<p id="auto_abd4b491-1fd8-418f-8a46-c0c9f96df944_fs-id1167470748198">In a very rough sense, you could think of the solar system as your house or apartment and the Galaxy as your town, made up of many houses and buildings. In the twentieth century, astronomers were able to show that, just as our world is made up of many, many towns, so the universe is made up of enormous numbers of galaxies. (We define the universe to be everything that exists that is accessible to our observations.) Galaxies stretch as far into space as our telescopes can see, many billions of them within the reach of modern instruments. When they were first discovered, some astronomers called galaxies <em data-effect="italics">island universes</em>, and the term is aptly descriptive; galaxies do look like islands of stars in the vast, dark seas of intergalactic space.</p>

<p id="auto_abd4b491-1fd8-418f-8a46-c0c9f96df944_fs-id1167470674892">The nearest galaxy, discovered in 1993, is a small one that lies 70,000 light-years from the Sun in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, where the smog in our own Galaxy makes it especially difficult to discern. (A constellation, we should note, is one of the 88 sections into which astronomers divide the sky, each named after a prominent star pattern within it.) Beyond this Sagittarius dwarf galaxy lie two other small galaxies, about 160,000 light-years away. First recorded by Magellan’s crew as he sailed around the world, these are called the <em data-effect="italics">Magellanic Clouds</em> (<a href="#auto_abd4b491-1fd8-418f-8a46-c0c9f96df944_OSC_Astro_01_07_NGalaxy" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). All three of these small galaxies are satellites of the Milky Way Galaxy, interacting with it through the force of gravity. Ultimately, all three may even be swallowed by our much larger Galaxy, as other small galaxies have been over the course of cosmic time.</p>

<p id="auto_abd4b491-1fd8-418f-8a46-c0c9f96df944_fs-id1167471022317">At even greater distances, where many ordinary galaxies are too dim to see, we find <em data-effect="italics">quasars</em>. These are brilliant centers of galaxies, glowing with the light of an extraordinarily energetic process. The enormous energy of the quasars is produced by gas that is heated to a temperature of millions of degrees as it falls toward a massive black hole and swirls around it. The brilliance of quasars makes them the most distant beacons we can see in the dark oceans of space. They allow us to probe the universe 10 billion light-years away or more, and thus 10 billion years or more in the past.</p>

<p id="auto_abd4b491-1fd8-418f-8a46-c0c9f96df944_fs-id1167471054676">With quasars we can see way back close to the Big Bang explosion that marks the beginning of time. Beyond the quasars and the most distant visible galaxies, we have detected the feeble glow of the explosion itself, filling the universe and thus coming to us from all directions in space. The discovery of this “afterglow of creation” is considered to be one of the most significant events in twentieth-century science, and we are still exploring the many things it has to tell us about the earliest times of the universe.</p>

<p id="auto_abd4b491-1fd8-418f-8a46-c0c9f96df944_fs-id1167470696965">Measurements of the properties of galaxies and quasars in remote locations require large telescopes, sophisticated light-amplifying devices, and painstaking labor. Every clear night, at observatories around the world, astronomers and students are at work on such mysteries as the birth of new stars and the large-scale structure of the universe, fitting their results into the tapestry of our understanding.</p>

<p id="auto_15fa90be-da2d-48d6-bae9-f3b84d1d3960_fs-id1167470911704">The foregoing discussion has likely impressed on you that the universe is extraordinarily large and extraordinarily empty. On average, it is 10,000 times more empty than our Galaxy. Yet, as we have seen, even the Galaxy is mostly empty space. The air we breathe has about 10<sup>19</sup> atoms in each cubic centimeter—and we usually think of air as empty space. In the interstellar gas of the Galaxy, there is about one atom in every cubic centimeter. Intergalactic space is filled so sparsely that to find one atom, on average, we must search through a cubic meter of space. Most of the universe is fantastically empty; places that are dense, such as the human body, are tremendously rare.</p>

<p id="auto_15fa90be-da2d-48d6-bae9-f3b84d1d3960_fs-id1167467265057">Even our most familiar solids are mostly space. If we could take apart such a solid, piece by piece, we would eventually reach the tiny molecules from which it is formed. Molecules are the smallest particles into which any matter can be divided while still retaining its chemical properties. A molecule of water (H<sub>2</sub>O), for example, consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom bonded together.</p>

<p id="auto_15fa90be-da2d-48d6-bae9-f3b84d1d3960_fs-id1167470981808">Molecules, in turn, are built of atoms, which are the smallest particles of an element that can still be identified as that element. For example, an atom of gold is the smallest possible piece of gold. Nearly 100 different kinds of atoms (elements) exist in nature. Most of them are rare, and only a handful account for more than 99% of everything with which we come in contact. The most abundant elements in the cosmos today are listed in <a href="#auto_15fa90be-da2d-48d6-bae9-f3b84d1d3960_fs-id1167470992433" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>; think of this table as the “greatest hits” of the universe when it comes to elements. Note that the list includes the four elements most common in life on Earth—hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.</p>

<p id="auto_15fa90be-da2d-48d6-bae9-f3b84d1d3960_fs-id1167470762978">All atoms consist of a central, positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The bulk of the matter in each atom is found in the nucleus, which consists of positive protons and electrically neutral neutrons all bound tightly together in a very small space. Each element is defined by the number of protons in its atoms. Thus, any atom with 6 protons in its nucleus is called <em data-effect="italics">carbon</em>, any with 50 protons is called <em data-effect="italics">tin</em>, and any with 70 protons is called <em data-effect="italics">ytterbium</em>. (For a list of the elements, see <a href="#page_55ecd3c3-0cdc-482c-8e2f-ec853554054d">Appendix K</a>.)</p>

<p id="auto_15fa90be-da2d-48d6-bae9-f3b84d1d3960_fs-id1167467389296">The distance from an atomic nucleus to its electrons is typically 100,000 times the size of the nucleus itself. This is why we say that even solid matter is mostly space. The typical atom is far emptier than the solar system out to Neptune. (The distance from Earth to the Sun, for example, is only 100 times the size of the Sun.) This is one reason atoms are not like miniature solar systems.</p>

<p id="auto_15fa90be-da2d-48d6-bae9-f3b84d1d3960_fs-id1167467579681">Remarkably, physicists have discovered that everything that happens in the universe, from the smallest atomic nucleus to the largest superclusters of galaxies, can be explained through the action of only four forces: gravity, electromagnetism (which combines the actions of electricity and magnetism), and two forces that act at the nuclear level. The fact that there are four forces (and not a million, or just one) has puzzled physicists and astronomers for many years and has led to a quest for a unified picture of nature.</p>

<p id="auto_bc9a9cec-f111-457a-8360-f3dfcdbfa410_fs-id1167471073713">If you are new to astronomy, you have probably reached the end of our brief tour in this chapter with mixed emotions. On the one hand, you may be fascinated by some of the new ideas you’ve read about and you may be eager to learn more. On the other hand, you may be feeling a bit overwhelmed by the number of topics we have covered, and the number of new words and ideas we have introduced. Learning astronomy is a little like learning a new language: at first it seems there are so many new expressions that you’ll never master them all, but with practice, you soon develop facility with them.</p>

<p id="auto_bc9a9cec-f111-457a-8360-f3dfcdbfa410_fs-id1167470554877">At this point you may also feel a bit small and insignificant, dwarfed by the cosmic scales of distance and time. But, there is another way to look at what you have learned from our first glimpses of the cosmos. Let us consider the history of the universe from the Big Bang to today and compress it, for easy reference, into a single year. (We have borrowed this idea from Carl Sagan’s 1977 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, <em data-effect="italics">The Dragons of Eden</em>.)</p>

<p id="auto_bc9a9cec-f111-457a-8360-f3dfcdbfa410_fs-id1167470660135">On this scale, the Big Bang happened at the first moment of January 1, and this moment, when you are reading this chapter would be the end of the very last second of December 31. When did other events in the development of the universe happen in this “cosmic year?” Our solar system formed around September 10, and the oldest rocks we can date on Earth go back to the third week in September (<a href="#auto_bc9a9cec-f111-457a-8360-f3dfcdbfa410_OSC_Astro_01_09_Cosmic" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_bc9a9cec-f111-457a-8360-f3dfcdbfa410_fs-id1167470706505">Where does the origin of human beings fall during the course of this cosmic year? The answer turns out to be the evening of December 31. The invention of the alphabet doesn’t occur until the fiftieth second of 11:59 p.m. on December 31. And the beginnings of modern astronomy are a mere fraction of a second before the New Year. Seen in a cosmic context, the amount of time we have had to study the stars is minute, and our success in piecing together as much of the story as we have is remarkable.</p>

<p id="auto_bc9a9cec-f111-457a-8360-f3dfcdbfa410_fs-id1167470890150">Certainly our attempts to understand the universe are not complete. As new technologies and new ideas allow us to gather more and better data about the cosmos, our present picture of astronomy will very likely undergo many changes. Still, as you read our current progress report on the exploration of the universe, take a few minutes every once in a while just to savor how much you have already learned.</p>

<p id="auto_bc9a9cec-f111-457a-8360-f3dfcdbfa410_fs-id1167467589660">If you enjoyed the beautiful images in this chapter (and there are many more fabulous photos to come in other chapters), you may want to know where you can obtain and download such pictures for your own enjoyment. (Many astronomy images are from government-supported instruments or projects, paid for by tax dollars, and therefore are free of copyright laws.) Here are three resources we especially like:</p>
<ul id="auto_bc9a9cec-f111-457a-8360-f3dfcdbfa410_fs-id1170325033056" data-bullet-style="bullet"><li>Astronomy Picture of the Day: <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html">apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html</a>. Two space scientists scour the Internet and select one beautiful astronomy image to feature each day. Their archives range widely, from images of planets and nebulae to rockets and space instruments; they also have many photos of the night sky. The search function (see the menu on the bottom of the page) works quite well for finding something specific among the many years’ worth of daily images.</li>
<li>Hubble Space Telescope Images: <a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/">https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/</a>. Here you can browse some of the remarkable images, select a particular subject in the menu boxes, or search for the name of an object that intrigues you in this book.</li>
<li>National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) Planetary Photojournal: <a href="https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov">photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov</a>. This site features thousands of images from planetary exploration, with captions of varied length.

He believes that Earth is flat and all the NASA images of a spherical Earth are either faked or simply show the round (but flat) disk of Earth from above. How could you prove to your new neighbor that Earth really is a sphere? (When you’ve thought about this on your own, you can check later in the chapter for some suggested answers.)</p>

<p id="auto_5669c796-2b05-4a8f-96ac-85939b9b32af_fs-id1170326177018">Today, few people really spend much time looking at the night sky. In ancient days, before electric lights robbed so many people of the beauty of the sky, the stars and planets were an important aspect of everyone’s daily life. All the records that we have—on paper and in stone—show that ancient civilizations around the world noticed, worshipped, and tried to understand the lights in the sky and fit them into their own view of the world. These ancient observers found both majestic regularity and never-ending surprise in the motions of the heavens. Through their careful study of the planets, the Greeks and later the Romans laid the foundation of the science of astronomy.</p>

<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325249981">Our senses suggest to us that Earth is the center of the universe—the hub around which the heavens turn. This <span data-type="term">geocentric</span> (Earth-centered) view was what almost everyone believed until the European Renaissance. After all, it is simple, logical, and seemingly self-evident. Furthermore, the geocentric perspective reinforced those philosophical and religious systems that taught the unique role of human beings as the central focus of the cosmos. However, the geocentric view happens to be wrong. One of the great themes of our intellectual history is the overthrow of the geocentric perspective. Let us, therefore, take a look at the steps by which we reevaluated the place of our world in the cosmic order.</p>

Gazing up, you get the impression that the sky is a great hollow dome with you at the center (<a href="#auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_OSC_Astro_02_01_SkyAround" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), and all the stars are an equal distance from you on the surface of the dome. The top of that dome, the point directly above your head, is called the <span data-type="term">zenith</span>, and where the dome meets Earth is called the <span data-type="term">horizon</span>. From the sea or a flat prairie, it is easy to see the horizon as a circle around you, but from most places where people live today, the horizon is at least partially hidden by mountains, trees, buildings, or smog.</p>

Watching the sky turn like this night after night, you might eventually get the idea that the dome of the sky is really part of a great sphere that is turning around you, bringing different stars into view as it turns. The early Greeks regarded the sky as just such a <span data-type="term">celestial sphere</span> (<a href="#auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_OSC_Astro_02_01_CSphere" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Some thought of it as an actual sphere of transparent crystalline material, with the stars embedded in it like tiny jewels.</p>

<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325055634">Today, we know that it is not the celestial sphere that turns as night and day proceed, but rather the planet on which we live. We can put an imaginary stick through Earth’s North and South Poles, representing our planet’s axis. It is because Earth turns on this axis every 24 hours that we see the Sun, Moon, and stars rise and set with clockwork regularity. Today, we know that these celestial objects are not really on a dome, but at greatly varying distances from us in space. Nevertheless, it is sometimes still convenient to talk about the celestial dome or sphere to help us keep track of objects in the sky. There is even a special theater, called a <em data-effect="italics">planetarium</em>, in which we project a simulation of the stars and planets onto a white dome.</p>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325053656">As the celestial sphere rotates, the objects on it maintain their positions with respect to one another. A grouping of stars such as the Big Dipper has the same shape during the course of the night, although it turns with the sky. During a single night, even objects we know to have significant motions of their own, such as the nearby planets, seem fixed relative to the stars. Only meteors—brief “shooting stars” that flash into view for just a few seconds—move appreciably with respect to other objects on the celestial sphere. (This is because they are not stars at all. Rather, they are small pieces of cosmic dust, burning up as they hit Earth’s atmosphere.) We can use the fact that the entire celestial sphere seems to turn together to help us set up systems for keeping track of what things are visible in the sky and where they happen to be at a given time.</p>

<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325055933">To help orient us in the turning sky, astronomers use a system that extends Earth’s axis points into the sky. Imagine a line going through Earth, connecting the North and South Poles. This is Earth’s axis, and Earth rotates about this line. If we extend this imaginary line outward from Earth, the points where this line intersects the celestial sphere are called the <em data-effect="italics">north celestial pole</em> and the <em data-effect="italics">south celestial pole</em>. As Earth rotates about its axis, the sky appears to turn in the opposite direction around those <span data-type="term">celestial poles</span> (<a href="#auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_OSC_Astro_02_01_SouthCPole" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). We also (in our imagination) throw Earth’s equator onto the sky and call this the <span data-type="term">celestial equator</span>. It lies halfway between the celestial poles, just as Earth’s equator lies halfway between our planet’s poles.</p>

<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170324977822">Now let’s imagine how riding on different parts of our spinning Earth affects our view of the sky. The apparent motion of the celestial sphere depends on your latitude (position north or south of the equator). First of all, notice that Earth’s axis is pointing at the celestial poles, so these two points in the sky do not appear to turn.</p>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325055154">If you stood at the North Pole of Earth, for example, you would see the north celestial pole overhead, at your zenith. The celestial equator, 90° from the celestial poles, would lie along your horizon. As you watched the stars during the course of the night, they would all circle around the celestial pole, with none rising or setting. Only that half of the sky north of the celestial equator is ever visible to an observer at the North Pole. Similarly, an observer at the South Pole would see only the southern half of the sky.</p>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170324977733">If you were at Earth’s equator, on the other hand, you see the celestial equator (which, after all, is just an “extension” of Earth’s equator) pass overhead through your zenith. The celestial poles, being 90° from the celestial equator, must then be at the north and south points on your horizon. As the sky turns, all stars rise and set; they move straight up from the east side of the horizon and set straight down on the west side. During a 24-hour period, all stars are above the horizon exactly half the time. (Of course, during some of those hours, the Sun is too bright for us to see them.)</p>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325085863">What would an observer in the latitudes of the United States or Europe see? Remember, we are neither at Earth’s pole nor at the equator, but in between them. For those in the continental United States and Europe, the north celestial pole is neither overhead nor on the horizon, but in between. It appears above the northern horizon at an angular height, or altitude, equal to the observer’s latitude. In San Francisco, for example, where the latitude is 38° N, the north celestial pole is 38° above the northern horizon.</p>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170324959842">For an observer at 38° N latitude, the south celestial pole is 38° below the southern horizon and, thus, never visible. As Earth turns, the whole sky seems to pivot about the north celestial pole. For this observer, stars within 38° of the North Pole can never set. They are always above the horizon, day and night. This part of the sky is called the north <span data-type="term">circumpolar zone</span>. For observers in the continental United States, the Big Dipper, Little Dipper, and Cassiopeia are examples of star groups in the north circumpolar zone. On the other hand, stars within 38° of the south celestial pole never rise. That part of the sky is the south circumpolar zone. To most U.S. observers, the Southern Cross is in that zone. (Don’t worry if you are not familiar with the star groups just mentioned; we will introduce them more formally later on.)</p>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170324940771">At this particular time in Earth’s history, there happens to be a star very close to the north celestial pole. It is called <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Polaris</span>, the pole star, and has the distinction of being the star that moves the least amount as the northern sky turns each day. Because it moved so little while the other stars moved much more, it played a special role in the mythology of several Native American tribes, for example (some called it the “fastener of the sky”).</p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325078360" class="astronomy astronomy-basics"><div data-type="title" id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_7">What’s Your Angle?</div>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170324984134">Astronomers measure how far apart objects appear in the sky by using angles. By definition, there are 360° in a circle, so a circle stretching completely around the celestial sphere contains 360°. The half-sphere or dome of the sky then contains 180° from horizon to opposite horizon. Thus, if two stars are 18° apart, their separation spans about 1/10 of the dome of the sky. To give you a sense of how big a degree is, the full Moon is about half a degree across. This is about the width of your smallest finger (pinkie) seen at arm’s length.</p>

<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325064585">We described the movement of stars in the night sky, but what about during the daytime? The stars continue to circle during the day, but the brilliance of the Sun makes them difficult to see. (The Moon can often be seen in the daylight, however.) On any given day, we can think of the Sun as being located at some position on the hypothetical celestial sphere. When the Sun rises—that is, when the rotation of Earth carries the Sun above the horizon—sunlight is scattered by the molecules of our atmosphere, filling our sky with light and hiding the stars above the horizon.</p>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325073385">For thousands of years, astronomers have been aware that the Sun does more than just rise and set. It changes position gradually on the celestial sphere, moving each day about 1° to the east relative to the stars. Very reasonably, the ancients thought this meant the Sun was slowly moving around Earth, taking a period of time we call 1 <span data-type="term">year</span> to make a full circle. Today, of course, we know it is Earth that is going around the Sun, but the effect is the same: the Sun’s position in our sky changes day to day. We have a similar experience when we walk around a campfire at night; we see the flames appear in front of each person seated about the fire in turn.</p>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170324928658">The path the Sun appears to take around the celestial sphere each year is called the <span data-type="term">ecliptic</span> (<a href="#auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_OSC_Astro_02_01_Ecliptic" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Because of its motion on the ecliptic, the Sun rises about 4 minutes later each day with respect to the stars. Earth must make just a bit more than one complete rotation (with respect to the stars) to bring the Sun up again.</p><figure id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_OSC_Astro_02_01_Star"><div data-type="title" id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_8">Star Circles at Different Latitudes.</div><figcaption>The turning of the sky looks different depending on your latitude on Earth. The red circle in each case is your horizon. Your zenith is the point above your head. (a) At the North Pole, the stars circle the zenith and do not rise and set. (b) At the equator, the celestial poles are on the horizon, and the stars rise straight up and set straight down.

<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325085979">The Sun is not the only object that moves among the fixed stars. The Moon and each of the planets that are visible to the unaided eye—Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus (although just barely)—also change their positions slowly from day to day. During a single day, the Moon and planets all rise and set as Earth turns, just as the Sun and stars do. But like the Sun, they have independent motions among the stars, superimposed on the daily rotation of the celestial sphere. Noticing these motions, the Greeks of 2000 years ago distinguished between what they called the <em data-effect="italics">fixed stars</em>—those that maintain fixed patterns among themselves through many generations—and the <em data-effect="italics">wandering stars</em>, or <span data-type="term">planets</span>. The word “planet,” in fact, means “wanderer” in ancient Greek.</p>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170324915969">Today, we do not regard the Sun and Moon as planets, but the ancients applied the term to all seven of the moving objects in the sky. Much of ancient astronomy was devoted to observing and predicting the motions of these celestial wanderers. They even dedicated a unit of time, the week, to the seven objects that move on their own; that’s why there are 7 days in a week. The Moon, being Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor, has the fastest apparent motion; it completes a trip around the sky in about 1 month (or <em data-effect="italics">moonth</em>). To do this, the Moon moves about 12°, or 24 times its own apparent width on the sky, each day.</p>

The Moon moves in the sky relative to the background stars (in addition to moving with the stars as a result of Earth’s rotation.) Go outside at night and note the position of the Moon relative to nearby stars. Repeat the observation a few hours later. How far has the Moon moved? (For reference, the diameter of the Moon is about 0.5°.) Based on your estimate of its motion, how long will it take for the Moon to return to the position relative to the stars in which you first observed it?</p>

The planets, the Sun, and the Moon are thus always found in the sky within a narrow 18-degree-wide belt, centered on the ecliptic, called the <span data-type="term">zodiac</span> (<a href="#auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_OSC_Astro_02_01_Ecliptic" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). (The root of the term “zodiac” is the same as that of the word “zoo” and means a collection of animals; many of the patterns of stars within the zodiac belt reminded the ancients of animals, such as a fish or a goat.)</p>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325065166">How the planets appear to move in the sky as the months pass is a combination of their actual motions plus the motion of Earth about the Sun; consequently, their paths are somewhat complex. As we will see, this complexity has fascinated and challenged astronomers for centuries.</p>

<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325054689">The backdrop for the motions of the “wanderers” in the sky is the canopy of stars. If there were no clouds in the sky and we were on a flat plain with nothing to obstruct our view, we could see about 3000 stars with the unaided eye. To find their way around such a multitude, the ancients found groupings of stars that made some familiar geometric pattern or (more rarely) resembled something they knew. Each civilization found its own patterns in the stars, much like a modern Rorschach test in which you are asked to discern patterns or pictures in a set of inkblots. The ancient Chinese, Egyptians, and Greeks, among others, found their own groupings—or constellations—of stars. These were helpful in navigating among the stars and in passing their star lore on to their children.</p>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325091077">You may be familiar with some of the old star patterns we still use today, such as the Big Dipper, Little Dipper, and Orion the hunter, with his distinctive belt of three stars (<a href="#auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_OSC_Astro_02_01_Orion" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). However, many of the stars we see are not part of a distinctive star pattern at all, and a telescope reveals millions of stars too faint for the eye to see. Therefore, during the early decades of the 20th century, astronomers from many countries decided to establish a more formal system for organizing the sky.</p>

<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170325250284">Today, we use the term <em data-effect="italics">constellation</em> to mean one of 88 sectors into which we divide the sky, much as the United States is divided into 50 states. The modern boundaries between the constellations are imaginary lines in the sky running north–south and east–west, so that each point in the sky falls in a specific constellation, although, like the states, not all constellations are the same size. All the constellations are listed in <a href="#page_0e15f0fc-0d77-4a0b-8b70-cfdffc87b73f">Appendix L</a>. Whenever possible, we have named each modern <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">constellation</span> after the Latin translations of one of the ancient Greek star patterns that lies within it. Thus, the modern constellation of Orion is a kind of box on the sky, which includes, among many other objects, the stars that made up the ancient picture of the hunter. Some people use the term <em data-effect="italics">asterism</em> to denote an especially noticeable star pattern within a constellation (or sometimes spanning parts of several constellations). For example, the Big Dipper is an asterism within the constellation of Ursa Major, the Big Bear.</p>
<p id="auto_8c5081ca-2ce9-44b9-8491-bfa4d6948d6e_fs-id1170324979827">Students are sometimes puzzled because the constellations seldom resemble the people or animals for which they were named. In all likelihood, the Greeks themselves did not name groupings of stars because they looked like actual people or subjects (any more than the outline of Washington state resembles George Washington). Rather, they named sections of the sky in honor of the characters in their mythology and then fit the star configurations to the animals and people as best they could.</p>

We see only half of this sphere at one time, limited by the horizon; the point directly overhead is our zenith. The Sun’s annual path on the celestial sphere is the ecliptic—a line that runs through the center of the zodiac, which is the 18-degree-wide strip of the sky within which we always find the Moon and planets. The celestial sphere is organized into 88 constellations, or sectors.</p>

<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325240419">Let us now look briefly back into history. Much of modern Western civilization is derived in one way or another from the ideas of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and this is true in astronomy as well. However, many other ancient cultures also developed sophisticated systems for observing and interpreting the sky.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325249147"><h3 data-type="title">Astronomy around the World</h3>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325246595">Ancient Babylonian, Assyrian, and Egyptian astronomers knew the approximate length of the year. The Egyptians of 3000 years ago, for example, adopted a calendar based on a 365-day year. They kept careful track of the rising time of the bright star Sirius in the predawn sky, which has a yearly cycle that corresponded with the flooding of the Nile River. The Chinese also had a working calendar; they determined the length of the year at about the same time as the Egyptians. The Chinese also recorded comets, bright meteors, and dark spots on the Sun. (Many types of astronomical objects were introduced in <a href="#page_ff8e6ee8-8a50-4756-b95e-c3b8e803622b">Science and the Universe: A Brief Tour</a>. If you are not familiar with terms like <em data-effect="italics">comets</em> and <em data-effect="italics">meteors</em>, you may want to review that chapter.) Later, Chinese astronomers kept careful records of “guest stars”—those that are normally too faint to see but suddenly flare up to become visible to the unaided eye for a few weeks or months. We still use some of these records in studying stars that exploded a long time ago.</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170324973959">The Mayan culture in Mexico and Central America developed a sophisticated calendar based on the planet Venus, and they made astronomical observations from sites dedicated to this purpose a thousand years ago. The Polynesians learned to navigate by the stars over hundreds of kilometers of open ocean—a skill that enabled them to colonize new islands far away from where they began.</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325091718">In Britain, before the widespread use of writing, ancient people used stones to keep track of the motions of the Sun and Moon. We still find some of the great stone circles they built for this purpose, dating from as far back as 2800 BCE. The best known of these is Stonehenge, which is discussed in <a href="#page_1620756f-04bc-4173-b549-e693ce6e573f">Earth, Moon, and Sky</a>.<a href="#auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_astrocultures" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_astrocultures">For resources providing more information about the astronomy of diverse cultures around the world, please see <a href="http://bit.ly/astrocultures">http://bit.ly/astrocultures</a>.</aside>

<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170324909823">Our concept of the cosmos—its basic structure and origin—is called <span data-type="term">cosmology</span>, a word with Greek roots. Before the invention of telescopes, humans had to depend on the simple evidence of their senses for a picture of the universe. The ancients developed cosmologies that combined their direct view of the heavens with a rich variety of philosophical and religious symbolism.</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325070773">At least 2000 years before Columbus, educated people in the eastern Mediterranean region knew Earth was round. Belief in a spherical Earth may have stemmed from the time of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Pythagoras</span>, a philosopher and mathematician who lived 2500 years ago. He believed circles and spheres to be “perfect forms” and suggested that Earth should therefore be a sphere. As evidence that the gods liked spheres, the Greeks cited the fact that the Moon is a sphere, using evidence we describe later.</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325085933">The writings of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Aristotle</span> (384–322 BCE), the tutor of Alexander the Great, summarize many of the ideas of his day. They describe how the progression of the Moon’s phases—its apparent changing shape—results from our seeing different portions of the Moon’s sunlit hemisphere as the month goes by (see <a href="#page_1620756f-04bc-4173-b549-e693ce6e573f">Earth, Moon, and Sky</a>). Aristotle also knew that the Sun has to be farther away from Earth than is the Moon because occasionally the Moon passed exactly between Earth and the Sun and hid the Sun temporarily from view. We call this a <em data-effect="italics">solar eclipse</em>.</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325072472">Aristotle cited convincing arguments that Earth must be round. First is the fact that as the Moon enters or emerges from Earth’s shadow during an eclipse of the Moon, the shape of the shadow seen on the Moon is always round (<a href="#auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_OSC_Astro_02_02_RoundShad" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Only a spherical object always produces a round shadow. If Earth were a disk, for example, there would be some occasions when the sunlight would strike it edge-on and its shadow on the Moon would be a line.</p>

<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325069738">As a second argument, Aristotle explained that travelers who go south a significant distance are able to observe stars that are not visible farther north. And the height of the North Star—the star nearest the north celestial pole—decreases as a traveler moves south. On a flat Earth, everyone would see the same stars overhead. The only possible explanation is that the traveler must have moved over a curved surface on Earth, showing stars from a different angle. (See the <a href="#auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325247382">How Do We Know Earth Is Round?</a> feature for more ideas on proving Earth is round.)</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170324959855">One Greek thinker, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Aristarchus</span> of Samos (310–230 BCE), even suggested that Earth was moving around the Sun, but Aristotle and most of the ancient Greek scholars rejected this idea. One of the reasons for their conclusion was the thought that if Earth moved about the Sun, they would be observing the stars from different places along Earth’s orbit. As Earth moved along, nearby stars should shift their positions in the sky relative to more distant stars. In a similar way, we see foreground objects appear to move against a more distant background whenever we are in motion. When we ride on a train, the trees in the foreground appear to shift their position relative to distant hills as the train rolls by. Unconsciously, we use this phenomenon all of the time to estimate distances around us.</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325249977">The apparent shift in the direction of an object as a result of the motion of the observer is called <span data-type="term">parallax</span>. We call the shift in the apparent direction of a star due to Earth’s orbital motion <em data-effect="italics">stellar parallax</em>. The Greeks made dedicated efforts to observe stellar parallax, even enlisting the aid of Greek soldiers with the clearest vision, but to no avail. The brighter (and presumably nearer) stars just did not seem to shift as the Greeks observed them in the spring and then again in the fall (when Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun).</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325098796">This meant either that Earth was not moving or that the stars had to be so tremendously far away that the parallax shift was immeasurably small. A cosmos of such enormous extent required a leap of imagination that most ancient philosophers were not prepared to make, so they retreated to the safety of the Earth-centered view, which would dominate Western thinking for nearly two millennia.</p>

<li>Let’s watch a ship leave its port and sail into the distance on a clear day. On a flat Earth, we would just see the ship get smaller and smaller as it sails away. But this isn’t what we actually observe. Instead, ships sink below the horizon, with the hull disappearing first and the mast remaining visible for a while longer. Eventually, only the top of the mast can be seen as the ship sails around the curvature of Earth. Finally, the ship disappears under the horizon.</li>
<li>The International Space Station circles Earth once every 90 minutes or so. Photographs taken from the shuttle and other satellites show that Earth is round from every perspective.</li>
<li>Suppose you made a friend in each time zone of Earth. You call all of them at the same hour and ask, “Where is the Sun?” On a flat Earth, each caller would give you roughly the same answer. But on a round Earth you would find that, for some friends, the Sun would be high in the sky whereas for others it would be rising, setting, or completely out of sight (and this last group of friends would be upset with you for waking them up).</li>

Its rays strike different parts of Earth along diverging paths. From a light source at B, or at C (which is still farther away), the angle between rays that strike opposite parts of Earth is smaller. The more distant the source, the smaller the angle between the rays. For a source infinitely distant, the rays travel along parallel lines.</p>

<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325124290">Of course, the Sun is not infinitely far away, but given its distance of 150 million kilometers, light rays striking Earth from a point on the Sun diverge from one another by an angle far too small to be observed with the unaided eye. As a consequence, if people all over Earth who could see the Sun were to point at it, their fingers would, essentially, all be parallel to one another. (The same is also true for the planets and stars—an idea we will use in our discussion of how telescopes work.)</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170324984630">Eratosthenes was told that on the first day of summer at Syene, Egypt (near modern Aswan), sunlight struck the bottom of a vertical well at noon. This indicated that the Sun was directly over the well—meaning that Syene was on a direct line from the center of Earth to the Sun. At the corresponding time and date in Alexandria, Eratosthenes observed the shadow a column made and saw that the Sun was not directly overhead, but was slightly south of the zenith, so that its rays made an angle with the vertical equal to about 1/50 of a circle (7°). Because the Sun’s rays striking the two cities are parallel to one another, why would the two rays not make the same angle with Earth’s surface? Eratosthenes reasoned that the curvature of the round Earth meant that “straight up” was not the same in the two cities. And the measurement of the angle in Alexandria, he realized, allowed him to figure out the size of Earth. Alexandria, he saw, must be 1/50 of Earth’s circumference north of Syene (<a href="#auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_OSC_Astro_02_02_Eratosthen" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Alexandria had been measured to be 5000 stadia north of Syene. (The <em data-effect="italics">stadium</em> was a Greek unit of length, derived from the length of the racetrack in a stadium.) Eratosthenes thus found that Earth’s circumference must be 50 × 5000, or 250,000 stadia.</p>

The Sun’s rays come in parallel, but because Earth’s surface curves, a ray at Syene comes straight down whereas a ray at Alexandria makes an angle of 7° with the vertical. That means, in effect, that at Alexandria, Earth’s surface has curved away from Syene by 7° of 360°, or 1/50 of a full circle. Thus, the distance between the two cities must be 1/50 the circumference of Earth.

If it was the common Olympic stadium, his result is about 20% too large. According to another interpretation, he used a stadium equal to about 1/6 kilometer, in which case his figure was within 1% of the correct value of 40,000 kilometers. Even if his measurement was not exact, his success at measuring the size of our planet by using only shadows, sunlight, and the power of human thought was one of the greatest intellectual achievements in history.</p>

<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325086350">Perhaps the greatest astronomer of antiquity was <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hipparchus</span>, born in Nicaea in what is present-day Turkey. He erected an observatory on the island of Rhodes around 150 BCE, when the Roman Republic was expanding its influence throughout the Mediterranean region. There he measured, as accurately as possible, the positions of objects in the sky, compiling a pioneering star catalog with about 850 entries. He designated celestial coordinates for each star, specifying its position in the sky, just as we specify the position of a point on Earth by giving its latitude and longitude.</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325095374">He also divided the stars into <span data-type="term">apparent magnitudes</span> according to their apparent brightness. He called the brightest ones “stars of the first magnitude”; the next brightest group, “stars of the second magnitude”; and so forth. This rather arbitrary system, in modified form, still remains in use today (although it is less and less useful for professional astronomers).</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170324939194">By observing the stars and comparing his data with older observations, Hipparchus made one of his most remarkable discoveries: the position in the sky of the north celestial pole had altered over the previous century and a half. Hipparchus deduced correctly that this had happened not only during the period covered by his observations, but was in fact happening all the time: the direction around which the sky appears to rotate changes slowly but continuously. Recall from the section on celestial poles and the celestial equator that the north celestial pole is just the projection of Earth’s North Pole into the sky. If the north celestial pole is wobbling around, then Earth itself must be doing the wobbling. Today, we understand that the direction in which Earth’s axis points does indeed change slowly but regularly—a motion we call <span data-type="term">precession</span>. If you have ever watched a spinning top wobble, you observed a similar kind of motion. The top’s axis describes a path in the shape of a cone, as Earth’s gravity tries to topple it (<a href="#auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_OSC_Astro_02_02_Precession" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170324914942">Normally, planets move eastward in the sky over the weeks and months as they orbit the Sun, but from positions B to D in <a href="#auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_OSC_Astro_02_02_Retrograde" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, as Earth passes the planets in our example, it appears to drift backward, moving west in the sky. Even though it is actually moving to the east, the faster-moving Earth has overtaken it and seems, from our perspective, to be leaving it behind. As Earth rounds its orbit toward position E, the planet again takes up its apparent eastward motion in the sky. The temporary apparent westward motion of a planet as Earth swings between it and the Sun is called <span data-type="term">retrograde motion</span>. Such backward motion is much easier for us to understand today, now that we know Earth is one of the moving planets and not the unmoving center of all creation. But Ptolemy was faced with the far more complex problem of explaining such motion while assuming a stationary Earth.</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325199699">Furthermore, because the Greeks believed that celestial motions had to be circles, Ptolemy had to construct his model using circles alone. To do it, he needed dozens of circles, some moving around other circles, in a complex structure that makes a modern viewer dizzy. But we must not let our modern judgment cloud our admiration for Ptolemy’s achievement. In his day, a complex universe centered on Earth was perfectly reasonable and, in its own way, quite beautiful. However, as Alfonso X, the King of Castile, was reported to have said after having the Ptolemaic system of planet motions explained to him, “If the Lord Almighty had consulted me before embarking upon Creation, I should have recommended something simpler.”</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325052073">Ptolemy solved the problem of explaining the observed motions of planets by having each planet revolve in a small orbit called an <span data-type="term">epicycle</span>. The center of the epicycle then revolved about Earth on a circle called a <em data-effect="italics">deferent</em> (<a href="#auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_OSC_Astro_02_02_CSystem" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).

When the planet is at <em data-effect="italics">y</em>, however, its motion is in the direction opposite to the motion of the epicycle’s center around Earth. By choosing the right combination of speeds and distances, Ptolemy succeeded in having the planet moving westward at the correct speed and for the correct interval of time, thus replicating retrograde motion with his model.</p>

Their actual behavior cannot be represented accurately by a scheme of uniform circular motions. In order to match the observed motions of the planets, Ptolemy had to center the deferent circles, not on Earth, but at points some distance from Earth. In addition, he introduced uniform circular motion around yet another axis, called the <em data-effect="italics">equant point</em>. All of these considerably complicated his scheme.</p>
<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170324944008">It is a tribute to the genius of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Ptolemy</span> as a mathematician that he was able to develop such a complex system to account successfully for the observations of planets. It may be that Ptolemy did not intend for his cosmological model to describe reality, but merely to serve as a mathematical representation that allowed him to predict the positions of the planets at any time. Whatever his thinking, his model, with some modifications, was eventually accepted as authoritative in the Muslim world and (later) in Christian Europe.</p>

<p id="auto_3eb6f7c7-5832-4824-b71b-2fa5c5859cb6_fs-id1170325210818">Ancient Greeks such as Aristotle recognized that Earth and the Moon are spheres, and understood the phases of the Moon, but because of their inability to detect stellar parallax, they rejected the idea that Earth moves. Eratosthenes measured the size of Earth with surprising precision. Hipparchus carried out many astronomical observations, making a star catalog, defining the system of stellar magnitudes, and discovering precession from the apparent shift in the position of the north celestial pole. Ptolemy of Alexandria summarized classic astronomy in his <em data-effect="italics">Almagest</em>; he explained planetary motions, including retrograde motion, with remarkably good accuracy using a model centered on Earth. This geocentric model, based on combinations of uniform circular motion using epicycles, was accepted as authority for more than a thousand years.</p>

<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326273667">Many ancient cultures regarded the planets and stars as representatives or symbols of the gods or other supernatural forces that controlled their lives. For them, the study of the heavens was not an abstract subject; it was connected directly to the life-and-death necessity of understanding the actions of the gods and currying favor with them. Before the time of our scientific perspectives, everything that happened in nature—from the weather, to diseases and accidents, to celestial surprises such as eclipses or new comets—was thought to be an expression of the whims or displeasure of the gods. Any signs that helped people understand what these gods had in mind were considered extremely important.</p>

<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326189025">The movements of the seven objects that had the power to “wander” through the realm of the sky—the Sun, the Moon, and five planets visible to the unaided eye—clearly must have special significance in such a system of thinking.</p>

<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326331298">Most ancient cultures associated these seven objects with various supernatural rulers in their pantheon and kept track of them for religious reasons. Even in the comparatively sophisticated Greece of antiquity, the planets had the names of gods and were credited with having the same powers and influences as the gods whose names they bore. From such ideas was born the ancient system called <span data-type="term">astrology</span>, still practiced by some people today, in which the positions of these bodies among the stars of the zodiac are thought to hold the key to understanding what we can expect from life.</p>

<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326189500">Astrology began in Babylonia about two and half millennia ago. The Babylonians, believing the planets and their motions influenced the fortunes of kings and nations, used their knowledge of astronomy to guide their rulers. When the Babylonian culture was absorbed by the Greeks, astrology gradually came to influence the entire Western world and eventually spread to Asia as well.</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326086596">By the 2nd century BCE the Greeks democratized astrology by developing the idea that the planets influence every individual. In particular, they believed that the configuration of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the moment of birth affected a person’s personality and fortune—a doctrine called <em data-effect="italics">natal astrology</em>. Natal astrology reached its peak with Ptolemy 400 years later. As famous for his astrology as for his astronomy, Ptolemy compiled the <em data-effect="italics">Tetrabiblos</em>, a treatise on astrology that remains the “bible” of the subject. It is essentially this ancient religion, older than Christianity or Islam, that is still practiced by today’s astrologers.</p>

The word “horoscope” comes from the Greek words <em data-effect="italics">hora</em> (meaning “time”) and <em data-effect="italics">skopos</em> (meaning a “watcher” or “marker”), so “horoscope” can literally be translated as “marker of the hour.” When a horoscope is charted, the planets (including the Sun and Moon, classed as <em data-effect="italics">wanderers</em> by the ancients) must first be located in the zodiac. At the time astrology was set up, the zodiac was divided into 12 sectors called <em data-effect="italics">signs</em> (<a href="#auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_OSC_Astro_02_03_Signs" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), each 30° long. Each sign was named after a constellation in the sky through which the Sun, Moon, and planets were seen to pass—the sign of Virgo after the constellation of Virgo, for example.</p>

<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326451832">When someone today casually asks you your “sign,” they are asking for your “sun sign”—which zodiac sign the Sun was in at the moment you were born. However, more than 2000 years have passed since the signs received their names from the constellations. Because of precession, the constellations of the zodiac slide westward along the ecliptic, going once around the sky in about 26,000 years. Thus, today the real stars have slipped around by about 1/12 of the zodiac—about the width of one sign.</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326285526">In most forms of astrology, however, the signs have remained assigned to the dates of the year they had when astrology was first set up. This means that the astrological signs and the real constellations are out of step; the sign of Aries, for example, now occupies the constellation of Pisces. When you look up your sun sign in a newspaper astrology column, the name of the sign associated with your birthday is no longer the name of the constellation in which the Sun was actually located when you were born. To know that constellation, you must look for the sign before the one that includes your birthday.</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326146147">A complete horoscope shows the location of not only the Sun, but also the Moon and each planet in the sky by indicating its position in the appropriate sign of the zodiac. However, as the celestial sphere turns (owing to the rotation of Earth), the entire zodiac moves across the sky to the west, completing a circuit of the heavens each day. Thus, the position in the sky (or “house” in astrology) must also be calculated. There are more or less standardized rules for the interpretation of the horoscope, most of which (at least in Western schools of astrology) are derived from the <em data-effect="italics">Tetrabiblos</em> of Ptolemy. Each sign, each house, and each planet—the last acting as a center of force—is supposed to be associated with particular matters in a person’s life.</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326286012">The detailed interpretation of a horoscope is a very complicated business, and there are many schools of astrological thought on how it should be done. Although some of the rules may be standardized, how each rule is to be weighed and applied is a matter of judgment—and “art.” It also means that it is very difficult to tie down astrology to specific predictions or to get the same predictions from different astrologers.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326133229"><h3 data-type="title">Astrology Today</h3>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326291627">Astrologers today use the same basic principles laid down by Ptolemy nearly 2000 years ago. They cast horoscopes (a process much simplified by the development of appropriate computer programs) and suggest interpretations. Sun sign astrology (which you read in the newspapers and many magazines) is a recent, simplified variant of natal astrology. Although even professional astrologers do not place much trust in such a limited scheme, which tries to fit everyone into just 12 groups, sun sign astrology is taken seriously by many people (perhaps because it is discussed so commonly in the media).</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326449333">Today, we know much more about the nature of the planets as physical bodies, as well as about human genetics, than the ancients could. It is hard to imagine how the positions of the Sun, Moon, or planets in the sky at the moment of our birth could have anything to do with our personality or future. There are no known forces, not gravity or anything else, that could cause such effects. (For example, a straightforward calculation shows that the gravitational pull of the obstetrician delivering a newborn baby is greater than that of Mars.) Astrologers thus have to argue there must be unknown forces exerted by the planets that depend on their configurations with respect to one another and that do not vary according to the distance of the planet—forces for which there is no shred of evidence.</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326285978">Another curious aspect of astrology is its emphasis on planet configurations at birth. What about the forces that might influence us at conception? Isn’t our genetic makeup more important for determining our personality than the circumstances of our birth? Would we really be a different person if we had been born a few hours earlier or later, as astrology claims? (Back when astrology was first conceived, birth was thought of as a moment of magic significance, but today we understand a lot more about the long process that precedes it.)</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326323200">Actually, very few well-educated people today buy the claim that our entire lives are predetermined by astrological influences at birth, but many people apparently believe that astrology has validity as an indicator of affinities and personality. A surprising number of Americans make judgments about people—whom they will hire, associate with, and even marry—on the basis of astrological information. To be sure, these are difficult decisions, and you might argue that we should use any relevant information that might help us to make the right choices. But does astrology actually provide any useful information on human personality? This is the kind of question that can be tested using the scientific method (see <a href="#auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326451942">Testing Astrology</a>).</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326284400">The results of hundreds of tests are all the same: there is no evidence that natal astrology has any predictive power, even in a statistical sense. Why, then, do people often seem to have anecdotes about how well their own astrologer advised them? Effective astrologers today use the language of the zodiac and the horoscope only as the outward trappings of their craft. Mostly they work as amateur therapists, offering simple truths that clients like or need to hear. (Recent studies have shown that just about any sort of short-term therapy makes people feel a little better because the very act of talking about our problems with someone who listens attentively is, in itself, beneficial.)</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326178646">The scheme of astrology has no basis in scientific fact, however; at best, it can be described as a pseudoscience. It is an interesting historical system, left over from prescientific days and best remembered for the impetus it gave people to learn the cycles and patterns of the sky. From it grew the science of astronomy, which is our main subject for discussion.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326451942" class="astronomy making-connections"><div data-type="title" id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_3">Testing Astrology</div>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326347948">In response to modern public interest in astrology, scientists have carried out a wide range of statistical tests to assess its predictive power. The simplest of these examine sun sign astrology to determine whether—as astrologers assert—some signs are more likely than others to be associated with some objective measure of success, such as winning Olympic medals, earning high corporate salaries, or achieving elective office or high military rank. (You can devise such a test yourself by looking up the birth dates of all members of Congress, for example, or all members of the U.S. Olympic team.) Are our political leaders somehow selected at birth by their horoscopes and thus more likely to be Leos, say, than Scorpios?</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326053838">You do not even need to be specific about your prediction in such tests. After all, many practitioners of astrology disagree about which signs go with which personality characteristics. To demonstrate the validity of the astrological hypothesis, it would be sufficient if the birthdays of all our leaders clustered in any one or two signs in some statistically significant way. Dozens of such tests have been performed, and all have come up completely negative: the birth dates of leaders in all fields tested have been found to be distributed randomly among <em data-effect="italics">all</em> the signs. Sun sign astrology does not predict anything about a person’s future occupation or strong personality traits.</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326160334">In a fine example of such a test, two statisticians examined the reenlistment records of the United States Marine Corps. We suspect you will agree that it takes a certain kind of personality not only to enlist, but also to reenlist in the Marines. If sun signs can predict strong personality traits—as astrologers claim—then those who reenlisted (with similar personalities) should have been distributed preferentially in those one or few signs that matched the personality of someone who loves being a Marine. However, the reenlisted were distributed randomly among all the signs.</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326177773">More sophisticated studies have also been done, involving full horoscopes calculated for thousands of individuals. The results of all these studies are also negative: none of the systems of astrology has been shown to be at all effective in connecting astrological aspects to personality, success, or finding the right person to love.</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326453935">Other tests show that it hardly seems to matter what a horoscope interpretation says, as long as it is vague enough, and as long as each subject feels it was prepared personally just for him or her. The French statistician Michel Gauquelin, for example, sent the horoscope interpretation for one of the worst mass murderers in history to 150 people, but told each recipient that it was a “reading” prepared exclusively for him or her. Ninety-four percent of the readers said they recognized themselves in the interpretation of the mass murderer’s horoscope.</p>
<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326212427">Geoffrey Dean, an Australian researcher, reversed the astrological readings of 22 subjects, substituting phrases that were the opposite of what the horoscope actually said. Yet, his subjects said that the resulting readings applied to them just as often (95%) as the people to whom the original phrases were given.</p>

<p id="auto_3e7849d9-bda2-4f03-8517-953f63735a69_fs-id1170326273622">The ancient religion of astrology, with its main contribution to civilization a heightened interest in the heavens, began in Babylonia. It reached its peak in the Greco-Roman world, especially as recorded in the <em data-effect="italics">Tetrabiblos</em> of Ptolemy. Natal astrology is based on the assumption that the positions of the planets at the time of our birth, as described by a horoscope, determine our future. However, modern tests clearly show that there is no evidence for this, even in a broad statistical sense, and there is no verifiable theory to explain what might cause such an astrological influence.</p>

<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326036479">Astronomy made no major advances in strife-torn medieval Europe. The birth and expansion of Islam after the seventh century led to a flowering of Arabic and Jewish cultures that preserved, translated, and added to many of the astronomical ideas of the Greeks. Many of the names of the brightest stars, for example, are today taken from the Arabic, as are such astronomical terms as “zenith.”</p>

<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326330379">As European culture began to emerge from its long, dark age, trading with Arab countries led to a rediscovery of ancient texts such as <em data-effect="italics">Almagest</em> and to a reawakening of interest in astronomical questions. This time of rebirth (in French, “<em data-effect="italics">renaissance</em>”) in astronomy was embodied in the work of Copernicus (<a href="#auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_OSC_Astro_02_04_Copernicus" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

Nicolaus <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Copernicus</span> was born in Torun, a mercantile town along the Vistula River. His training was in law and medicine, but his main interests were astronomy and mathematics. His great contribution to science was a critical reappraisal of the existing theories of planetary motion and the development of a new Sun-centered, or <span data-type="term">heliocentric</span>, model of the solar system. Copernicus concluded that Earth is a planet and that all the planets circle the Sun.

By this time, the old Ptolemaic system needed significant adjustments to predict the positions of the planets correctly. Copernicus wanted to develop an improved theory from which to calculate planetary positions, but in doing so, he was himself not free of all traditional prejudices.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326293981">He began with several assumptions that were common in his time, such as the idea that the motions of the heavenly bodies must be made up of combinations of uniform circular motions. But he did not assume (as most people did) that Earth had to be in the center of the universe, and he presented a defense of the heliocentric system that was elegant and persuasive. His ideas, although not widely accepted until more than a century after his death, were much discussed among scholars and, ultimately, had a profound influence on the course of world history.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326283032">One of the objections raised to the heliocentric theory was that if Earth were moving, we would all sense or feel this motion. Solid objects would be ripped from the surface, a ball dropped from a great height would not strike the ground directly below it, and so forth. But a moving person is not necessarily aware of that motion. We have all experienced seeing an adjacent train, bus, or ship appear to move, only to discover that it is we who are moving.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326452078">Copernicus argued that the apparent motion of the Sun about Earth during the course of a year could be represented equally well by a motion of Earth about the Sun. He also reasoned that the apparent rotation of the celestial sphere could be explained by assuming that Earth rotates while the celestial sphere is stationary. To the objection that if Earth rotated about an axis it would fly into pieces, Copernicus answered that if such motion would tear Earth apart, the still faster motion of the much larger celestial sphere required by the geocentric hypothesis would be even more devastating.</p>

<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326093672">The most important idea in Copernicus’ <em data-effect="italics">De Revolutionibus</em> is that Earth is one of six (then-known) planets that revolve about the Sun. Using this concept, he was able to work out the correct general picture of the solar system. He placed the planets, starting nearest the Sun, in the correct order: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Further, he deduced that the nearer a planet is to the Sun, the greater its orbital speed. With his theory, he was able to explain the complex retrograde motions of the planets without epicycles and to work out a roughly correct scale for the solar system.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326396963">Copernicus could not prove that Earth revolves about the Sun. In fact, with some adjustments, the old Ptolemaic system could have accounted, as well, for the motions of the planets in the sky. But Copernicus pointed out that the Ptolemaic cosmology was clumsy and lacking the beauty and symmetry of its successor.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326284307">In Copernicus’ time, in fact, few people thought there were ways to prove whether the heliocentric or the older geocentric system was correct. A long philosophical tradition, going back to the Greeks and defended by the Catholic Church, held that pure human thought combined with divine revelation represented the path to truth. Nature, as revealed by our senses, was suspect. For example, Aristotle had reasoned that heavier objects (having more of the quality that made them heavy) must fall to Earth faster than lighter ones. This is absolutely incorrect, as any simple experiment dropping two balls of different weights shows. However, in Copernicus’ day, experiments did not carry much weight (if you will pardon the expression); Aristotle’s reasoning was more convincing.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326347838">In this environment, there was little motivation to carry out observations or experiments to distinguish between competing cosmological theories (or anything else). It should not surprise us, therefore, that the heliocentric idea was debated for more than half a century without any tests being applied to determine its validity. (In fact, in the North American colonies, the older geocentric system was still taught at Harvard University in the first years after it was founded in 1636.)</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326316767">Contrast this with the situation today, when scientists rush to test each new hypothesis and do not accept any ideas until the results are in. For example, when two researchers at the University of Utah announced in 1989 that they had discovered a way to achieve nuclear fusion (the process that powers the stars) at room temperature, other scientists at more than 25 laboratories around the United States attempted to duplicate “cold fusion” within a few weeks—without success, as it turned out. The cold fusion theory soon went down in flames.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326205471">How would we look at Copernicus’ model today? When a new hypothesis or theory is proposed in science, it must first be checked for consistency with what is already known. Copernicus’ heliocentric idea passes this test, for it allows planetary positions to be calculated at least as well as does the geocentric theory. The next step is to determine which predictions the new hypothesis makes that differ from those of competing ideas. In the case of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Copernicus</span>, one example is the prediction that, if Venus circles the Sun, the planet should go through the full range of phases just as the Moon does, whereas if it circles Earth, it should not (<a href="#auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_OSC_Astro_02_04_VenusPhase" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Also, we should not be able to see the full phase of Venus from Earth because the Sun would then be between Venus and Earth. But in those days, before the telescope, no one imagined testing these predictions.</p>

<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326227001">Many of the modern scientific concepts of observation, experimentation, and the testing of hypotheses through careful quantitative measurements were pioneered by a man who lived nearly a century after Copernicus. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Galileo</span> Galilei (<a href="#auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_OSC_Astro_02_04_Galileo" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), a contemporary of Shakespeare, was born in Pisa. Like Copernicus, he began training for a medical career, but he had little interest in the subject and later switched to mathematics. He held faculty positions at the University of Pisa and the University of Padua, and eventually became mathematician to the Grand Duke of Tuscany in Florence.</p>

<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326202864">Galileo’s greatest contributions were in the field of mechanics, the study of motion and the actions of forces on bodies. It was familiar to all persons then, as it is to us now, that if something is at rest, it tends to remain at rest and requires some outside influence to start it in motion. Rest was thus generally regarded as the natural state of matter. Galileo showed, however, that rest is no more natural than motion.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326325539">If an object is slid along a rough horizontal floor, it soon comes to rest because friction between it and the floor acts as a retarding force. However, if the floor and the object are both highly polished, the object, given the same initial speed, will slide farther before stopping. On a smooth layer of ice, it will slide farther still. Galileo reasoned that if all resisting effects could be removed, the object would continue in a steady state of motion indefinitely. He argued that a force is required not only to start an object moving from rest but also to slow down, stop, speed up, or change the direction of a moving object. You will appreciate this if you have ever tried to stop a rolling car by leaning against it, or a moving boat by tugging on a line.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326118511"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Galileo</span> also studied the way objects <span data-type="term">accelerate</span>—change their speed or direction of motion. Galileo watched objects as they fell freely or rolled down a ramp. He found that such objects accelerate uniformly; that is, in equal intervals of time they gain equal increments in speed. Galileo formulated these newly found laws in precise mathematical terms that enabled future experimenters to predict how far and how fast objects would move in various lengths of time.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326051951" class="astronomy link-to-learning">
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326189617">In theory, if Galileo is right, a feather and a hammer, dropped at the same time from a height, should land at the same moment. On Earth, this experiment is not possible because air resistance and air movements make the feather flutter, instead of falling straight down, accelerated only by the force of gravity. For generations, physics teachers had said that the place to try this experiment is somewhere where there is no air, such as the Moon. In 1971, <em data-effect="italics">Apollo 15</em> astronaut David Scott took a hammer and feather to the Moon and tried it, to the delight of physics nerds everywhere. NASA provides the <a href="https://openstax.org/l/30HamVsFeath">video of the hammer and feather</a> as well as a brief explanation.</p>
</div>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326189032">Sometime in the 1590s, Galileo adopted the Copernican hypothesis of a heliocentric solar system. In Roman Catholic Italy, this was not a popular philosophy, for Church authorities still upheld the ideas of Aristotle and Ptolemy, and they had powerful political and economic reasons for insisting that Earth was the center of creation. Galileo not only challenged this thinking but also had the audacity to write in Italian rather than scholarly Latin, and to lecture publicly on those topics. For him, there was no contradiction between the authority of the Church in matters of religion and morality, and the authority of nature (revealed by experiments) in matters of science. It was primarily because of Galileo and his “dangerous” opinions that, in 1616, the Church issued a prohibition decree stating that the Copernican doctrine was “false and absurd” and not to be held or defended.</p>

The first such “spyglasses” (now called <em data-effect="italics">telescopes</em>) that attracted much notice were made in 1608 by the Dutch spectacle maker Hans Lippershey (1570–1619). Galileo heard of the discovery and, without ever having seen an assembled telescope, constructed one of his own with a three-power magnification (3×), which made distant objects appear three times nearer and larger (<a href="#auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_OSC_Astro_02_04_Telescope" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326071924">On August 25, 1609, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Galileo</span> demonstrated a telescope with a magnification of 9× to government officials of the city-state of Venice. By a magnification of 9×, we mean the linear dimensions of the objects being viewed appeared nine times larger or, alternatively, the objects appeared nine times closer than they really were. There were obvious military advantages associated with a device for seeing distant objects. For his invention, Galileo’s salary was nearly doubled, and he was granted lifetime tenure as a professor. (His university colleagues were outraged, particularly because the invention was not even original.)</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326332815">Others had used the telescope before Galileo to observe things on Earth. But in a flash of insight that changed the history of astronomy, Galileo realized that he could turn the power of the telescope toward the heavens. Before using his telescope for astronomical observations, Galileo had to devise a stable mount and improve the optics. He increased the magnification to 30×. Galileo also needed to acquire confidence in the telescope.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326272858">At that time, human eyes were believed to be the final arbiter of truth about size, shape, and color. Lenses, mirrors, and prisms were known to distort distant images by enlarging, reducing, or inverting them, or spreading the light into a spectrum (rainbow of colors). Galileo undertook repeated experiments to convince himself that what he saw through the telescope was identical to what he saw up close. Only then could he begin to believe that the miraculous phenomena the telescope revealed in the heavens were real.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326086881">Beginning his astronomical work late in 1609, Galileo found that many stars too faint to be seen with the unaided eye became visible with his telescope. In particular, he found that some nebulous blurs resolved into many stars, and that the Milky Way—the strip of whiteness across the night sky—was also made up of a multitude of individual stars.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326145096">Examining the planets, Galileo found four moons revolving about <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Jupiter</span> in times ranging from just under 2 days to about 17 days. This discovery was particularly important because it showed that not everything has to revolve around Earth. Furthermore, it demonstrated that there could be centers of motion that are themselves in motion. Defenders of the geocentric view had argued that if Earth was in motion, then the Moon would be left behind because it could hardly keep up with a rapidly moving planet. Yet, here were Jupiter’s moons doing exactly that. (To recognize this discovery and honor his work, NASA named a spacecraft that explored the Jupiter system Galileo.)</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326177938">With his telescope, Galileo was able to carry out the test of the Copernican theory mentioned earlier, based on the phases of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Venus</span>. Within a few months, he had found that Venus goes through phases like the Moon, showing that it must revolve about the Sun, so that we see different parts of its daylight side at different times (see <a href="#auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_OSC_Astro_02_04_VenusPhase" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.) These observations could not be reconciled with Ptolemy’s model, in which Venus circled about Earth. In Ptolemy’s model, Venus could also show phases, but they were the wrong phases in the wrong order from what Galileo observed.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326453388">Galileo also observed the Moon and saw craters, mountain ranges, valleys, and flat, dark areas that he thought might be water. These discoveries showed that the Moon might be not so dissimilar to Earth—suggesting that Earth, too, could belong to the realm of celestial bodies.</p>

<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326133911">After Galileo’s work, it became increasingly difficult to deny the Copernican view, and Earth was slowly dethroned from its central position in the universe and given its rightful place as one of the planets attending the Sun. Initially, however, Galileo met with a great deal of opposition. The Roman Catholic Church, still reeling from the Protestant Reformation, was looking to assert its authority and chose to make an example of Galileo. He had to appear before the Inquisition to answer charges that his work was heretical, and he was ultimately condemned to house arrest. His books were on the Church’s forbidden list until 1836, although in countries where the Roman Catholic Church held less sway, they were widely read and discussed. Not until 1992 did the Catholic Church admit publicly that it had erred in the matter of censoring Galileo’s ideas.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326318258">The new ideas of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Copernicus</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Galileo</span> began a revolution in our conception of the cosmos. It eventually became evident that the universe is a vast place and that Earth’s role in it is relatively unimportant. The idea that Earth moves around the Sun like the other planets raised the possibility that they might be worlds themselves, perhaps even supporting life. As Earth was demoted from its position at the center of the universe, so, too, was humanity. The universe, despite what we may wish, does not revolve around us.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326321980">Most of us take these things for granted today, but four centuries ago such concepts were frightening and heretical for some, immensely stimulating for others. The pioneers of the Renaissance started the European world along the path toward science and technology that we still tread today. For them, nature was rational and ultimately knowable, and experiments and observations provided the means to reveal its secrets.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1163975696714" class="astronomy seeing-for-yourself"><div data-type="title" id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_11">Observing the Planets</div>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326321204">At most any time of the night, and at any season, you can spot one or more bright planets in the sky. All five of the planets known to the ancients—Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—are more prominent than any but the brightest stars, and they can be seen even from urban locations if you know where and when to look. One way to tell planets from bright stars is that planets twinkle less.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326323617">Venus, which stays close to the Sun from our perspective, appears either as an “evening star” in the west after sunset or as a “morning star” in the east before sunrise. It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. It far outshines any real star, and under the most favorable circumstances, it can even cast a visible shadow. Some young military recruits have tried to shoot Venus down as an approaching enemy craft or UFO.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326171164">Mars, with its distinctive red color, can be nearly as bright as Venus is when close to Earth, but normally it remains much less conspicuous. Jupiter is most often the second-brightest planet, approximately equaling in brilliance the brightest stars. Saturn is dimmer, and it varies considerably in brightness, depending on whether its large rings are seen nearly edge-on (faint) or more widely opened (bright).</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326320080">Mercury is quite bright, but few people ever notice it because it never moves very far from the Sun (it’s never more than 28° away in the sky) and is always seen against bright twilight skies.</p>
<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326244703">True to their name, the planets “wander” against the background of the “fixed” stars. Although their apparent motions are complex, they reflect an underlying order upon which the heliocentric model of the solar system, as described in this chapter, was based. The positions of the planets are often listed in newspapers (sometimes on the weather page), and clear maps and guides to their locations can be found each month in such magazines as <em data-effect="italics">Sky &amp; Telescope</em> and <em data-effect="italics">Astronomy</em> (available at most libraries and online). There are also a number of computer programs and phone and tablet apps that allow you to display where the planets are on any night.</p>

<p id="auto_0fa12f98-6991-469f-9e81-e518d4b1507b_fs-id1170326242846">Nicolaus Copernicus introduced the heliocentric cosmology to Renaissance Europe in his book <em data-effect="italics">De Revolutionibus</em>. Although he retained the Aristotelian idea of uniform circular motion, Copernicus suggested that Earth is a planet and that the planets all circle about the Sun, dethroning Earth from its position at the center of the universe. Galileo was the father of both modern experimental physics and telescopic astronomy. He studied the acceleration of moving objects and, in 1610, began telescopic observations, discovering the nature of the Milky Way, the large-scale features of the Moon, the phases of Venus, and four moons of Jupiter. Although he was accused of heresy for his support of heliocentric cosmology, Galileo is credited with observations and brilliant writings that convinced most of his scientific contemporaries of the reality of the Copernican theory.</p>

<li>With your group, consider the question with which we began this chapter. How many ways can you think of to prove to a member of the “Flat Earth Society” that our planet is, indeed, round?</li>
<li>Make a list of ways in which a belief in astrology (the notion that your life path or personality is controlled by the position of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the time of your birth) might be harmful to an individual or to society at large.</li>
<li>Have members of the group compare their experiences with the night sky. Did you see the Milky Way? Can you identify any constellations? Make a list of reasons why you think so many fewer people know the night sky today than at the time of the ancient Greeks. Discuss reasons for why a person, today, may want to be acquainted with the night sky.</li>
<li>Constellations commemorate great heroes, dangers, or events in the legends of the people who name them. Suppose we had to start from scratch today, naming the patterns of stars in the sky. Whom or what would you choose to commemorate by naming a constellation after it, him, or her and why (begin with people from history; then if you have time, include living people as well)? Can the members of your group agree on any choices?</li>
<li>Although astronomical mythology no longer holds a powerful sway over the modern imagination, we still find proof of the power of astronomical images in the number of products in the marketplace that have astronomical names. How many can your group come up with? (Think of things like Milky Way candy bars, Eclipse and Orbit gum, or Comet cleanser.)</li>

<p id="auto_4a274b24-cc3d-4264-b5c5-7527026d831e_fs-id1172468280608">In this brief appendix, we want to give you some hints for the effective study of astronomy. These suggestions are based on ideas from good teachers and good students around the United States. Your professor will probably have other, more specific suggestions for doing well in your class.</p>

<p id="auto_4a274b24-cc3d-4264-b5c5-7527026d831e_fs-id1172468244893">Astronomy, the study of the universe beyond the borders of our planet, is one of the most exciting and rapidly changing branches of science. Even scientists from other fields often confess to having had a lifelong interest in astronomy, though they may now be doing something earthbound—like biology, chemistry, engineering, or writing software.</p>

<p id="auto_4a274b24-cc3d-4264-b5c5-7527026d831e_fs-id1172468264124">But some of the things that make astronomy so interesting also make it a challenge for the beginning student. The universe is a big place, full of objects and processes that do not have familiar counterparts here on Earth. Like a visitor to a new country, it will take you a while to feel familiar with the territory or the local customs. Astronomy, like other sciences, also has its own special vocabulary, some of which you will have to learn to communicate well with your professor and classmates.</p>

<p id="auto_4a274b24-cc3d-4264-b5c5-7527026d831e_fs-id1172468094597">Still, hundreds of thousands of non-science majors take an introductory astronomy course every year, and surveys show that students from a wide range of backgrounds have succeeded in (and even enjoyed) these classes. Astronomy is for everyone, not just those who are “science oriented.”</p>

<p id="auto_4a274b24-cc3d-4264-b5c5-7527026d831e_fs-id1172467971259">So, here are some suggestions to help you increase your chances of doing well in your astronomy class.</p>

<ol id="auto_4a274b24-cc3d-4264-b5c5-7527026d831e_fs-id1172468158804" type="1"><li>The best advice we can give you is to be sure to leave enough time in your schedule to study the material in this class regularly. It sounds obvious, but it is not very easy to catch up with a subject like astronomy by trying to do everything just before an exam. (As astronomers like to put it, you can’t learn the whole universe in one night!) Try to put aside some part of each day, or every other day, when you can have uninterrupted time for reading and studying astronomy.</li>
<li>In class, put your phone away and focus on the class activities. If you have to use a laptop or tablet in class, make a pact with yourself that you will <em data-effect="italics">not</em> check email, get on social media, or play games during class. A number of careful studies of student behavior and grades have shown that students are not as good at such multi-tasking as they think they are, and that students who do <em data-effect="italics">not</em> use screens during class get significantly better grades in the end.</li>
<li>Try to take careful notes during class. Many students start college without good note-taking habits. If you are not a good note-taker, try to get some help. Many colleges and universities have student learning centers that offer short courses, workbooks, tutors, or videos on developing good study habits. Good note-taking skills will also be useful for many jobs or activities you are likely get involved with after college.</li>
<li>Try to read each assignment in the textbook twice, once before it is discussed in class, and once afterward. You can highlight text or make notes in your copy of this electronic book: just move your cursor over some text and a box with highlight colors and room for notes will become visible.</li>
<li>Form a small astronomy study group with people in your class. Get together with them regularly and discuss what you have been learning. Also, focus on the topics that may be giving group members trouble. Make up sample exam questions and make sure everyone in the group can answer them confidently. If you have always studied alone, you may at first resist this idea, but don’t be too hasty to say no. Study groups are a very effective way to digest a large amount of new information.</li>
<li>Before each exam, create a concise outline of the main ideas discussed in class and presented in your text. Compare your outline with those of other students as a check on your own study habits.</li>
<li>If your professor suggests doing web-based sample quizzes, or looking at online apps, animations, or study guides, take advantage of these resources to enhance your studying.</li>
<li>At the end of each chapter in this textbook you, will find four kinds of questions. The Collaborative Group Activities are designed to encourage you follow up on the material in the chapter as a group, rather than individually. Review Questions help you see if you have learned the material in the chapter. Thought Questions test deeper understanding by asking you to apply your knowledge to new situations. And Figuring for Yourself exercises test and extend some of the mathematical examples in the chapter. (Not all professors will use the math sections; if they don’t, you may not have homework from this section.)</li>
<li>If you find a topic in the text or in class especially difficult or interesting, talk to your professor or teaching assistant. Many students are scared to show their ignorance in front of their teacher, but we can assure you that most professors and TA’s <em data-effect="italics">like</em> it when students come to office hours and show that they care enough about the course to ask for help.</li>
<li>Don’t stay up all night before a test and then expect your mind to respond well. For the same reason, don’t eat a big meal just before a test, since we all get a little sleepy and don’t think as clearly after a big meal. Take many deep breaths and try to relax during the test itself.</li>
<li>Don’t be too hard on yourself! If astronomy is new to you, many of the ideas and terms in this book may be unfamiliar. Astronomy is like any new language: it may take a while to become a good conversationalist. Practice as much as you can, but also realize that it is natural to feel overwhelmed by the vastness of the universe and the variety of things that are going on in it.</li>
