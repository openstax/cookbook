All OpenStax textbooks undergo a rigorous review process. However, like any professional-grade textbook, errors sometimes occur. Since our books are web based, we can make updates periodically when deemed pedagogically necessary. If you have a correction to suggest, submit it through the link on your book page on openstax.org. Subject matter experts review all errata suggestions. OpenStax is committed to remaining transparent about all updates, so you will also find a list of past errata changes on your book page on openstax.org.

Serving a student base of both majors and non-majors in the field, and an institutional variation in requirements of one or two semesters depending on the plan of study, the course introduces students to a global perspective of history couched in an engaging narrative. Concepts and assessments help students think critically about the issues they encounter so they can broaden their perspective of global history and how the topics studied apply to their current life as citizens of the world.</p>

          <h4 data-type="title">Coverage and scope</h4>
          <p id="auto_65d6f438-78c0-4b74-8701-ef973b62bdbf_fs-idm408331072">The 
<em data-effect="italics">World History</em> resource consists of 32 chapters, with a &#x201C;split&#x201D; at 1500 to align with the common division of the course across two semesters. The Table of Contents begins with a chapter on the study of history, explicitly addressing the nuances of perspective and interpretation, how those have informed the canon familiar to many students, and how students can broaden their knowledge and learning through a global perspective that is aware of the evolution of how history is studied and an appreciation for how it is relevant today. </p>
          <p id="auto_65d6f438-78c0-4b74-8701-ef973b62bdbf_fs-idm361100592">The first half of the text then introduces Part I, starting with human evolution and proceeding through early societies. Part II covers city-states and empires in the Mediterranean region and explores the Americas and Africa in ancient times. The role of religion in historical development is examined in Part III. The first half of the course closes with Part IV&#x2019;s coverage of the middle ages across the globe, including the Mongol, Ghanian, Malian, and Ottoman Empires, and the impact of climate change, the Black Plague, and the adoption of gunpowder. A brief closing chapter provides a framework to wrap up the discussion to 1500 and to contextualize the post-Columbus content that will begin the second half. This bridge will serve to help students understand that the conquests that follow were not an inevitability.</p>
          <p id="auto_65d6f438-78c0-4b74-8701-ef973b62bdbf_eip-44">The second half of the text spans the period from roughly 1500 CE to the present day. Part V examines the emergence of a global world via exchange and trade between regions. Starting around 1750 and moving into the 20th century, Part VI begins with colonization, teaches about revolutions in Europe, North America, and Latin America, and proceeds into chapters on expansion and labor resulting in the industrial world. Part VII spans to the present day with coverage on both world wars, the interwar period, and the Cold War, and closes with a chapter on globalization and the future. The final chapter addresses a global economy, technology, and social and environmental issues facing the world.</p>

In the 14th century, Mansa Musa&#x2019;s Malian kingdom was the most recent state in the history of the African Sahel to exploit the region&#x2019;s incredibly vast gold fields, having been preceded by the kingdom of Ghana (dubbed the &#x201C;Land of Gold&#x201D; by medieval Arab traders) and, in turn, succeeded by the Songhai kingdom. From their position astride the Sahelian trade routes, these centralized medieval African states exercised enormous influence over Trans-Saharan Trade, a system of exchange which connected West African gold with the economies of North Africa, the Middle East, southern Europe, and beyond.

But Africa&#x2019;s place in historical change was not always the product of external forces. Indeed, it was the great internal migration of Bantu-speaking peoples beginning in 3000 B.C.E. that was responsible for the laying of a common sociocultural foundation throughout most of the Africa south of the Sahara Desert. A process that took more than four thousand years, the Bantu Migrations introduced farming, pastoralism, and iron technology to the roving, hunting-gathering communities which had historically populated this region of Africa, giving rise to settled civilization. WW-test notes this opener is 287 words.</p>

Communities of hunter-gatherers were very small, typically consisting&#x2014;at most&#x2014;of several dozen people.

The small group size also meant little hierarchy and informal authority, although the earliest forms of role specialization are apparent at this stage of human development: younger and heartier members of the community were assigned more strenuous duties than the elderly; hunting was the preserve of menfolk; gathering was more typically the role of womenfolk and children. By around 60,000 years ago, these nomadic hunter-gatherers and their lifestyle could be found across most of Africa and had begun to move into Europe and Asia. </p>

The agricultural and pastoral innovations of the Neolithic Revolution came together in the period after 10,000 B.C.E. and brought with them important changes to the way of life of many of the Stone Age peoples of Africa. For the first time, the domestication of plants and animals&#x2014;or &#x201C;farming&#x201D;&#x2014;enabled fixed settlement, resulting in the abandonment of hunter-gatherer nomadism by all but a few African groups. Although scholars still debate its origins, the oldest evidence of agriculture and pastoralism comes from northeastern Africa where, sometime after 9000 B.C.E., the Nilo-Saharans adopted the grain-collecting and grinding techniques of their northern neighbors and applied them to sorghum and pearl millet, the tropical grasses of the middle Nile. By around 8000 B.C.E., they had invented pottery to cook a grain-based oatmeal-like dish. During the same period, the Nilo-Saharans domesticated the wild cattle of the Red Sea hills, developing herding and grazing techniques that, like their agricultural practices, gradually diffused westward across the Sahara and northward toward Egypt, as shown in <a href="#auto_7335a4e5-b65f-438f-9e89-931000468b59_Figure01_01_SealWinth" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.3</a>.

In the case of agriculture and pastoralism, environmental factors (such as rainfall and soil fertility) and biological factors (including the prevalence of the tsetse fly and lactose intolerance among human populations, both of which prevented the keeping of cattle) predetermined suitability. Nevertheless, agriculture was adopted successfully in most areas of Africa, often despite poor soil, and manifested first in West and Central Africa and, later, in East and Southern Africa. The coincidence of ironworking with agriculture shares a similar geography. In North, West, and Central Africa, farming generally preceded iron, while in East and Southern Africa, agriculture and iron spread nearly simultaneously.</p>

A Stone Age people, the proto-Bantu were agriculturalists who subsisted by cultivating pearl millet and yams and extracting oil from the abundant palm and bush candle (Canarium) trees of the region&#x2019;s luxuriant rainforests. Gradual changes in weather patterns caused the rainforests to recede and, coupled with increasingly seasonal rainfall, opened tracts of savanna between forested areas. Over time, these open patches merged to form the Sangha River Interval, a 200-mile-wide grassland running north-south between modern-day southeastern Cameroon, southern Central African Republic, and northern Republic of Congo. This grassland corridor allowed the hitherto forest-dwelling Bantu to move southward, through what had once been impenetrable tropical rainforest.</p>

Although scholars continue to debate the precise timing, motivation, and directions of expansion, linguistic and archaeological evidence in the form of pottery and ironmaking technology suggest that there were multiple waves of Bantu migrations. The earliest phase seems to have consisted of two phases: an initial eastern stream or &#x201C;early split,&#x201D; followed somewhat later by a western &#x201C;rivers and coasts&#x201D; stream. These streams moved gradually and sporadically, proceeding eastward first, across the northern reaches of the Congo forest and arriving in the interlacustrine or Great Lakes region of East Africa around 1500 B.C.E.

As small clusters of Bantu-speakers advanced into modern Kenya and Tanzania, nuclei of interlacustrine Bantu turned toward Congo, while other groups pushed southward, in the direction of southern East Africa. By the third or fourth century B.C.E., Bantu-speaking communities stretched from the extreme southern reaches of Somalia in the north to Mozambique in the south.

If one examines Lyotardist narrative, one is faced with a choice: either reject prestructuralist nationalism or conclude that the significance of the participant is significant form. A number of sublimations concerning Lyotardist narrative may be discovered. &#x201C;Society is part of the absurdity of reality,&#x201D; says Foucault. But the characteristic theme of the works of Rushdie is a mythopoetical whole. Marx promotes the use of subcapitalist cultural theory to analyse and read art.

However, the subject is interpolated into a Lyotardist narrative that includes narrativity as a reality.

Lyotard suggests the use of prestructuralist nationalism to deconstruct the status quo.But if Lyotardist narrative holds, we have to choose between Foucaultist power relations and precapitalist construction. Bataille promotes the use of subcapitalist cultural theory to analyse art.
Thus, Baudrillard uses the term &#x2018;Lyotardist narrative&#x2019; to denote not deappropriation, as subcapitalist cultural theory suggests, but subdeappropriation. The subject is interpolated into a prestructuralist nationalism that includes consciousness as a totality.

Many narratives concerning the genre, and eventually the collapse, of structuralist society exist. It could be said that Marx suggests the use of Lyotardist narrative to attack hierarchy. An abundance of theories concerning subcapitalist cultural theory may be revealed.

It was not until the early centuries of the Common Era that the western stream penetrated Angola in the far southern extreme of West Africa. Around this time, during the first half of the first millennium C.E., East Africa witnessed a third phase of Bantu expansion, with groups moving through and settling in parts of modern Mozambique, Botswana, Zambia, and eastern South Africa. By 500 C.E., all parts of the vast tropical rainforest had been settled by Bantu-speaking farming communities, and populations of Bantu-speaking peoples could be found throughout Southern Africa, from the savanna woodland south of the Congo forest and the savanna of northern Namibia in the west, to interlacustrine Greater East Africa, western Tanzania, and eastern Botswana in the east, to the Transvaal high veldt, Natal, and eastern Cape in the south. </p>

A significant stage in the millennia-long process of Bantu migrations is marked by the introduction of iron-smelting to equatorial Africa around 500 B.C.E. As seen in [link]Figure 01_01_NewWorld[/link], iron tools, such as axes, knives, and hoes, made possible Early Iron Age Bantu penetration into the stretches of rainforest to the south and east of the grassland, while iron weapons, such as knives, spears, and arrowheads, allowed them to successfully wage war against others. As they migrated southward and across savanna, the Bantu settled in regions that were thinly-populated by an array of peoples, ranging from hunting-gathering communities to cultures employing a wide variety of farming and animal husbandry techniques. Among these were Khoisan hunter-gatherers, Pygmy foragers, and Cushitic- and Sudanic-speaking peoples whose principal skills were pastoralism and cereal cultivation.

The expansion of Bantu-speakers during the Iron Age had the effect of laying a mostly common sociocultural foundation throughout the African subcontinent. The earliest stage of this development, between the second and fifth centuries C.E., was marked by the relatively rapid spread of iron-working farmers throughout much of eastern, western, and southeastern regions of the subcontinent. The nascent <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_7335a4e5-b65f-438f-9e89-931000468b59_term12" group-by="I">Iron Age</span> economy was dominated by farming, with the main crops being sorghum and millet, sometimes supplemented by melons and beans. Most of these farmers also kept livestock (including cattle, pigs, and chickens), although such animal husbandry as there was tended to be an adjunct feature to the period&#x2019;s overwhelmingly agricultural milieu. Because the regions into which they moved were thinly populated by roving bands of hunter-gatherers, Bantu-speakers were able to choose the most suitable land for farming. Still, their settlements during these earliest Iron Age centuries tended to be relatively small, typically consisting of a dozen or so houses, although large settlements (sometimes in the range of several hectares) could be found in regions such as Natal. A key consideration for the siting of these settlements was proximity to iron ore and wood sufficient to produce the charcoal to fire smelting furnaces and manufacture carbon steel. The embryonic nature of the early Iron Age Bantu economy necessitated an emphasis on self-sufficiency with little potential for trade, although evidence exists that communities engaged in some small-scale trade, particularly of sought-after commodities like copper and salt in regions of the Congo and Tanzania.

Down to around the eighth century, there was a centuries-long period of consolidation during which the resources of the more favorable areas were developed and exploited while adaptations were made to local environments. Throughout, the Bantu remained a classically &#x201C;stateless&#x201D; society. Organized along kinship lines, each village contained an extended family and its dependents. Typically, there was a clear division of labor: women tended crops, prepared food, and minded the smaller children, while men tended livestock, hunted for meat and for animal skins for clothing, and engaged in trade with other villages. Although some evidence suggests there were opportunities for women to assume leadership positions, this seems to have been exceptional: whereas the archaeological evidence of male dominance is considerable. Authority was, in any event, decentralized in these Bantu communities, with no rigidly hierarchical power structure which exercised central authority.

What makes people change or act? For much of history, the answer lay for most historians in the actions of elites&#x2014;Caesars, kings, and queens. This seemed natural in a world where the king&#x2019;s choice became everyone&#x2019;s choice and where sources rarely spoke about anyone other than noble lords and ladies.

Thomas Carlyle, a nineteenth century historian, considered the study of the lives of &#x201C;big men&#x201D; as enough to understand all of history. Higher education was the prevue of the rich; it must have seemed quite natural believe that only the elites could move history. </p>

The Romantics believed that there was greatness in the everyday. Even a small flower was worthy of a poem and the plight of a lowly squire was as important as the worries of the great lord of the manor for both were essential parts of the human experience. Tolstoy, writing later in 1860, argued that there is far more to history than the actions of one man. In <em data-effect="italics">War and Peace</em>, he contends that &#x201C;general mass of men&#x201D; who participate in history are the ones that truly cause events. </p>

To fully embrace the study of the past, the student of history must be able to set aside the assumptions of the modern era. It is not the historian&#x2019;s job to pass judgment on the past but present it as clearly as possible and to preserve that picture for future generations. The more strands that we can investigate and bring together, the more accurate the picture will be. And there is still much work to be done. For example, recent research into areas of LGQBT studies, indigenous studies, and the global south will continue to sharpen the image of the past.

And interpretative changes increase the number of ways we can use to get a clearer picture of those who lived before us. The danger lies in using only one lens. If you elevate one over all of the others, your picture of the past is less clear.</p>

The city of Rome gave its name to an empire that stretched from Britain to the Arabian Peninsula. The vast geographic expanse of the empire was reflected in the diversity of the experiences of those living within it. While political life was centered in the city of Rome &#x2013; the seat of the Senate and the emperor &#x2013; the daily lives of people across the empire varied greatly.

This arrangement largely benefited upper class Roman men, while others struggled to navigate the system and were subject to elite dominance. Roman women and enslaved people were held to restrictive cultural standards on their behavior, though many were able to overcome these to hold real influence in Roman society. The complexity of daily life in Rome is key to understanding how the empire functioned and flourished at its height.

In the 1774 portrait of George Whitefield by engraver Elisha Gallaudet (a), Whitefield appears with a gentle expression on his face. Although his hands are raised in exultation or entreaty, he does not look particularly roused or rousing. In the 1763 British political cartoon to the right, &#x201C;Dr. Squintum&#x2019;s Exaltation or the Reformation&#x201D; (b), Whitefield&#x2019;s hands are raised in a similar position, but there the similarities end.

By the early 1830s, all the lands east of the Mississippi River had been settled and admitted to the Union as states. The land west of the river, though in this contemporary map united with the settled areas in the body of an eagle symbolizing the territorial ambitions of the United States, remained largely unsettled by white Americans. Texas (just southwest of the bird&#x2019;s tail feathers) remained outside the U.S. border.

In the 1774 portrait of George Whitefield by engraver Elisha Gallaudet (a), Whitefield appears with a gentle expression on his face. Although his hands are raised in exultation or entreaty, he does not look particularly roused or rousing. In the 1763 British political cartoon to the right, &#x201C;Dr. Squintum&#x2019;s Exaltation or the Reformation&#x201D; (b), Whitefield&#x2019;s hands are raised in a similar position, but there the similarities end.

By the early 1830s, all the lands east of the Mississippi River had been settled and admitted to the Union as states. The land west of the river, though in this contemporary map united with the settled areas in the body of an eagle symbolizing the territorial ambitions of the United States, remained largely unsettled by white Americans. Texas (just southwest of the bird&#x2019;s tail feathers) remained outside the U.S. border.

In the 1774 portrait of George Whitefield by engraver Elisha Gallaudet (a), Whitefield appears with a gentle expression on his face. Although his hands are raised in exultation or entreaty, he does not look particularly roused or rousing. In the 1763 British political cartoon to the right, &#x201C;Dr. Squintum&#x2019;s Exaltation or the Reformation&#x201D; (b), Whitefield&#x2019;s hands are raised in a similar position, but there the similarities end.

It was not until the early centuries of the Common Era that the western stream penetrated Angola in the far southern extreme of West Africa.</p>

What makes people change or act? For much of history, the answer lay for most historians in the actions of elites&#x2014;Caesars, kings, and queens. This seemed natural in a world where the king&#x2019;s choice became everyone&#x2019;s choice and where sources rarely spoke about anyone other than noble lords and ladies. </p>

            <p id="auto_6dd92b44-db43-4254-a4db-45fb02eb773e_eip-562">
Family life was oriented around the <em data-effect="italics">paterfamilias</em>, the male head of the household. According to tradition, this patriarch had the power of life and death over all his dependents, an authority referred to as <em data-effect="italics">patria potestas</em>. Members of the extended family subject to this authority included the patriarch&#x2019;s wife, children, anyone descended through the family&#x2019;s male line, and all slaves belonging to the household. With his authority, the patriarch was both the judge and rule maker of the family, with the power to sell his dependents into bondage or destroy their property.

            <p id="auto_6dd92b44-db43-4254-a4db-45fb02eb773e_eip-496">
Despite these extreme powers, the goal of the <em data-effect="italics">paterfamilias</em> was to promote his family&#x2019;s welfare. Ultimately, a father&#x2019;s power worked through consensus and deliberation with the other members of the family.
</p>
            <p id="auto_6dd92b44-db43-4254-a4db-45fb02eb773e_eip-450">In early Rome, children were educated in the home; later, grammar schools enrolled boys and girls from wealthy families until around the age of twelve. Though more elite families could afford private tutors, education for Romans usually centered on reading and writing Latin and Greek as well as arithmetic. Around age fifteen, boys would don the <em data-effect="italics">toga virilis</em> (&#x201C;toga of manhood&#x201D;), a plain white toga representing their enrollment as citizens and entrance into manhood. Sons of prominent families could then go on to a civil or military career. Since men would eventually inherit their fathers&#x2019; property (as well as their debts), they were compelled to continue their family&#x2019;s prosperity.</p>
            <p id="auto_6dd92b44-db43-4254-a4db-45fb02eb773e_eip-576">By contrast, girls commonly married at a young age, most between fourteen and eighteen years old, and often to much older men. In the most common form of marriage, a wife entered a marriage with a dowry that became the husband&#x2019;s property. Thus, a woman from a wealthy background with a large dowry had some sway in making marriage arrangements. But less well-off women were more reliant on their husbands&#x2019; status. In any case, marriage represented a woman coming under the legal control of her husband&#x2019;s household.</p>
            <p id="auto_6dd92b44-db43-4254-a4db-45fb02eb773e_eip-163">This vast legal and age imbalance between husband and wife resonates with the cultural restrictions on Roman women (<a href="#auto_6dd92b44-db43-4254-a4db-45fb02eb773e_Figure01_02_FloridaMap" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.40</a>). Women were responsible for the management of the household, including ensuring provisions for the family, overseeing the slaves and other dependents, and looking after the children. Spinning wool was viewed as the activity of an ideal Roman woman, and many wives were expected to occupy themselves with this work. Despite these expectations, there is evidence that many women held professions outside the home, including in medicine, trade, and agriculture. </p>

            <p id="auto_6dd92b44-db43-4254-a4db-45fb02eb773e_eip-386">Romans lived and worked in a variety of contexts across the empire. Most of our evidence for understanding the practical elements of Roman daily life comes from archaeological evidence at Pompeii. This bustling Italian city shows us the occupations, architecture, and lifestyles of different social classes. In addition, though most of our evidence concerns wealthy estates, life outside the city in the countryside was an important part of Roman society.</p>
            <p id="auto_6dd92b44-db43-4254-a4db-45fb02eb773e_eip-535">Daily life was dominated by aristocratic men who enjoyed careers in politics, law, and the military. Social relationships centered on these upper-class patrons and their clients; every morning patrons would receive a number of clients in their homes seeking aid in exchange for loyalty. Afterward, a man&#x2019;s late morning usually involved responsibilities outside the home including business and political meetings. During the afternoon, wealthy Roman men would spend their time socializing and pursuing leisure activities, such as attending public entertainment performances or visiting the bathhouse.</p>

Beginning with the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, the world was plunged into war and the events that followed were horrifically absurd. All of the modern inventions and the spread of democratic institutions did not stop the bloody hell of trench warfare. People were more willing to question the authority of elites and religious leaders as they could be of little help once war began. Historians became more interested in the irrational aspects of the human condition, the psychology behind one&#x2019;s choices. </p>
            <p id="auto_6dd92b44-db43-4254-a4db-45fb02eb773e_eip-606">The counterculture of the 1960s deepened the desire to challenge existing norms. As students protested the Viet Nam war, the lack of Civil Rights, and the closed-mindedness of the previous generation, young historians developed new ideas. In their 1966 book, <em data-effect="italics">The Social Construction of Reality</em>, Peter Burger and Thomas Luckman argued our belief systems are informed by social constructs, the way society tells us to think and behave. Consider our first thought exercise. You believe education is important. Why? Who has said that to you in the past? How did you come to believe it? These constructs exist everywhere and they inform many decisions that we make, often on a subconscious level.  </p>

Process Costing is the optimal system when the production process is continuous and it is difficult to trace a particular input cost with a specific individual product. Process costing systems assign costs to each department as the costs are incurred. The costs to produce one unit is calculated based on the information from the production departments. The focus of process costing systems is on measuring and assigning the conversion costs to the proper department so the cost of the individual units can be determined.

Let us look at one more example. This time it will be the broader topic of Colonial Latin America, between the Spanish conquest and the independence movements of the 1820s. How would each school of thought approach the topic? The progressive historian might look at the growth of democratic legal systems or the increase in interest in republican forms of government. The intellectual historian might consider the literature and philosophy of the period. The social historian would look at things like what people ate, how they worked, what they looked for in marriage partners. A communist historian would look at issues of unfair labor practices and moments of class conflict like rebellion or riot. The feminist historian would investigate the great power differential that existed in this highly patriarchal society. And the post-colonialist would highlight aspects of colonialism that would remain impactful after independence. All of these interpretative elements help us weave together a more complete picture of the past as will future efforts to enhance our understanding.

Suburban villas were located just outside a city&#x2019;s walls, and villas located in the countryside typically originated as sites of agriculture. The large estates known as <em data-effect="italics">latifundia</em> were agricultural operations in which enslaved people worked the land for the owner&#x2019;s profit. In the imperial period, these estates came to contain villa residences that functioned more as places of recreation and displaying wealth. Many elements of luxury hinted at in townhouses appear in villas, such as gardens, fountains, and mosaics.</p>

Clients formed a largely educated class in Rome who supported themselves through the benefaction of their patrons and more meager employment. Though Romans typically had a six-hour workday, the urban poor relied more on occasional work or odd jobs. In large cities, many lived in insulae (sing. insula), large apartment complexes of three to four levels that occupied a rectangular block in a city. Insulae had a bad reputation, however, for being overcrowded and having limited facilities. Professions outside of the law and military were generally held by freedmen (a class of emancipated slaves) who worked in trade, agriculture, and education. Recall that you learned about this concept in the discussion on <a href="#page_7335a4e5-b65f-438f-9e89-931000468b59">The End of the Crusader States</a> and how it impacted political life in that era.</p>

The power of the <em data-effect="italics">paterfamilias</em> was mirrored in the power of Roman politicians and magistrates. Roman respect for authority, dispending justice, and honoring one&#x2019;s family had an effect on how Romans conducted themselves publicly. The motivations for furthering a family&#x2019;s prosperity extended to other facets of daily life (you will learn more about these in <a href="">Labor in the Industrial World</a>.
Politics were certainly an extension of Roman family principles. Senators were referred to as &#x201C;conscript fathers&#x201D; (<em data-effect="italics">patres conscripti</em>) and their authority dispensed through legislation and legal judgments was much like that of a father over his household. Laws concerning marriage and childbirth made once private matters a concern of the Roman state. For example, the emperor Augustus made adultery a public crime, setting out to promote childbirth in Rome and protect legal marriages. Yet, as with the expectations for women in Roman society discussed above, this legislation disproportionately punished women, who could be exiled as a result

Emperors were especially interested in maintaining their family&#x2019;s stability, for the practical reason of dynastic continuity but also for garnering positive public opinion. They took special interest in finding an heir for themselves and exercising tight control over family matters. Augustus worked diligently to name an heir to rule after him, going through several before being succeeded by his stepson Tiberius. Having an unstable household could mean a quick end to an emperor&#x2019;s reign if the situation became too tumultuous. In the later empire when there was high turnover of rulers, emperors would quickly name an heir after coming to power. <a href="#auto_599d385d-6a1a-4d76-b2cc-8636dacb7756_Figure01_03_PhilCity" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.41</a> shows the first map showing the street layout of Philadelphia.

Similarly, public figures who embodied Roman family values were looked upon favorably. Cornelia, a noblewoman in the second century BCE, is remembered for devoting herself to motherhood above all else. She gave birth to twelve children, but even after her husband died, she refused to remarry and focused on raising her remaining children. Her sons Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus led impactful political careers before they were both assassinated. Cornelia is reported to have said of her sons, in conversation with another woman displaying her jewelry, &#x201C;<em data-effect="italics">these</em> are my jewels.&#x201D; Cornelia was remembered for embodying feminine virtues in her motherly devotion and indirect impact on Roman politics.

In these public rituals, the deceased was carried from their home to the forum where the body was laid out. A eulogy was delivered by the heir, who was surrounded by others wearing ancestor masks that represented deceased family members. The procession tied the living family to the past, and the route through the city gave the ritual a public and communal significance.

Alliances had been a hallmark of nineteenth century diplomacy and had been successful in creating decades of peace on the continent and compressing the wars that did occur into finite affairs. In the 1900s the alliances had solidified into two oppositional blocs with major powers allying with one another and then developing relationships with smaller nations. The growth of Germany&#x2019;s territorial ambitions put it in direct conflict with other powers as it sought to expand colonial holdings (<a href="#auto_599d385d-6a1a-4d76-b2cc-8636dacb7756_Figure01_03_Elmina" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.43</a>). Germany&#x2019;s desire to be taken more seriously and be a &#x201C;player&#x201D; in global affairs threatened to destabilize the peace in Europe. Its competition with other countries, most notably Great Britain, led to military build-ups and a specter of war that would soon hang over Europe. </p>

In 1482, Portuguese traders built Elmina Castle (also called S&#xE3;o Jorge da Mina, or Saint George&#x2019;s of the Mine) in present-day Ghana, on the west coast of Africa. Originally the fort was used to trade gold, but by the sixteenth century it was serving as a holding pen for enslaved Africans waiting to board ships that would take them to the Americas. This image of the Elmina dates from the 1660s, when the fort had been seized by Dutch traders.

The work done in 1815 to create a balance of power among European nations in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars had been quite successful. The Concert of Europe had been able to absorb some internal conflicts and the growth of more liberal political thoughts without political or territorial instability happening. There were occasionally military conflicts, but these were usually of short duration and limited in scale. </p>

What was clear was that Prussia with its militarized culture did still see warfare as a means of achieving its own ends. Austro-Hungary and Prussia went to war in 1866. This conflict was handily won by Prussia which annexed several German states. It was a fairly quick war lasting approximately seven weeks. But, it effectively barred Austria from participating in German affairs from that point forward and insured that Prussia would be the dominant German state. It forced Austria into accepting the Dual Monarchy system with Hungary. </p>

The Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and 1871 is another example of these fairly rapid conflicts that resulted in major change. France declared war against Prussia after a dispute over who would inherit the Spanish throne. This war against France had fighting last only a few months, but Paris was laid siege to by the Prussian Army and Napoleon III was even captured. The treaty that ended the conflict had France pay a large war indemnity to Prussia. France also had to pay for the occupation forces along with losing the territories of Alsace and Lorraine (an area that would change hands several times through the World War II era). This was a humiliating defeat for France. This victory though paved the way for the unification of the German Empire. The signing of these imperial documents in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles cemented Prussia&#x2019;s leadership of the new country and its successful path to achieve what was not done in the Revolutions of 1848.

In Europe, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Estonia, Lithuania, and Greece all saw the reversion to authoritarian and or fascist regimes. Other European nations such as Britain, France, had fascist parties of various sizes. Outside of Europe there were fascist regimes and or movements in China, Japan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay. Totalitarianism of the left (communism) had a rich and well-developed theoretical foundation and intellectual tradition flowing back to 1859 and the writings of Marx and Engels. Communist theoreticians had been debating and refining their theories for eighty years or so when the Soviet Union was born in 1917. The totalitarianism of the Right was a much more disparate phenomenon as it sprung up in response to political, economic and emotional experiences of living through transitions from more traditional cultures and societies to new 20th century worldviews. Though it differed wherever it appeared, taking on many of the historical and cultural experiences of the society it sprung up in, it generally was a movement that sought to forge new nations that would deploy power and violence to build strong nations and eliminate all enemies, real or imagined (<a href="#auto_599d385d-6a1a-4d76-b2cc-8636dacb7756_Figure0103_NWPassage" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.44</a>). </p>

As described in the previous chapter, the complete set of financial statements acts as an <em data-effect="italics">X-ray</em> of a company&#x2019;s health. By evaluating all of the financial statements together, one with financial knowledge can determine the overall health of a company. The accountant can use this information to advise outside (and inside) stakeholders on decisions, and management can use this information as one tool to make strategic short-term and long-term decisions.

There are many different methods that can work, and you should choose the one that best suits your situation. If that method is not productive, of course you should try another. Remember, entrepreneurial visions are not made overnight, but with time and effort, you will refine your vision to best match your entrepreneurial goals and objectives.

This way of thinking can energize and motivate the entrepreneur to take their business to the next level. It is a learned behavior that can be adopted by any business founder who wants to continually improve their business. In the same way, entrepreneurial spirit is a key part of the start-up business. This is a forward thinking, problem solving, can-do approach to running the business. These two aspects of the business are reinforced by the entrepreneur&#x2019;s passion. This internal drive will keep the individual going when things get tough, because their passion will carry them on to the next thing. Passion sustains the entrepreneur because it speaks to the core of what they do and why they do it.</p>

Some of these business start-ups are the result of collaborative efforts of multi-disciplinary teams, where individuals from different disciplines come together to create items that they could not have created alone. We have also looked at the global nature of entrepreneurship, and the increasing diversity among entrepreneurs. This has resulted in many more new products and services available to meet consumer needs.</p>

      <p id="auto_b7c141f5-d943-441a-9e61-8358715b6f03_eip-736">WW-test notes that this appendix content includes index terms (length, mass, time), tables, tables with captions, a figure, an image, a footnote, centered text, one very long header, and LO icons. In the American system of measurement (originally developed in England), the fundamental units of length, weight, and time are the foot, pound, and second, respectively. There are also larger and smaller units, which include the ton (2240 lb), the mile (5280 ft), the rod (16 1/2 ft), the yard (3 ft), the inch (1/12 ft), the ounce (1/16 lb), and so on. Such units, whose origins in decisions by British royalty have been forgotten by most people, are quite inconvenient for conversion or doing calculations.</p>
