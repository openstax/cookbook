		This book is an invitation&#x2014;an invitation to students to step boldly into their college experience. <em data-effect="italics">College Success</em> addresses the evolving challenges and opportunities of today&#x2019;s diverse students. The intensive development work leveraged expertise from hundreds of FYE coordinators and faculty across the country. It highlights resources available to students as they embark on new roads of independence and responsibility. Students engage in careful self-analysis and research-based strategies to identify their strengths, challenges, and aptitudes. While they explore study skills and learning methods, they are continually asked to apply the concepts in reading, writing, and thinking exercises, which build both a solid base for classroom discussion and a portfolio they can augment throughout their college career. Recognizing the ubiquity of technology and social media, the authors address relevant information and advice where appropriate throughout the text. The material is rooted in motivation, growth-mindset, and resilience; student readers will feel seen and involved as they continually encounter one of the textbook&#x2019;s core themes: &#x201C;real-life&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t stop when college starts.

          <p id="auto_ec1a2d81-65a4-4f5e-8e37-25ec681a5299_eip-428">
Chapters begin and end with a survey, posing questions that will get readers engaged in considering their own level of connection and understanding of the chapter&#x2019;s concept, from time management to personal finance to career planning. The close of each chapter revisits the survey, helping students gauge how their understanding has evolved.

Student survey results are gathered anonymously and will be regularly provided to adopters as part of the instructor resources. (See below for more information on instructor resources.) In the future, the surveys will be assignable and the results viewable on an individual-course basis. For the survey results featured in the textbook, hundreds of students from a diverse array of colleges and universities provided their feedback to inform future students taking the course.

Each section of College Success includes an estimate of the average time needed to read through the material, work on the activities and applications, and&#x2014;where necessary&#x2014;explore external websites or watch videos. Each student will engage the material differently, and faculty will likely prioritize or assign certain components over others. As a result, the actual time students spend will vary greatly. OpenStax will periodically update these estimates based on user feedback. As with all other elements of the text, these estimates may be adjusted by instructors (or deleted completely) based on addition or removal of material or activities.

            <li>Overarching &#x201C;big picture&#x201D; questions from the chapter</li>
            <li>Topical and cumulative case scenario activities, which present a realistic situation based on the concepts, and ask students to respond via writing or another method. These may be adapted and assigned by instructors.  </li>

These questions will help you determine how the chapter concepts relate to you right now. As we are introduced to new concepts and practices, it can be informative to reflect on how your understanding changes over time. We&#x2019;ll revisit these questions at the end of the chapter to see whether your feelings have changed. Take this quick survey to figure it out, ranking questions on a scale of 1 &#x2013; 4, 1 meaning &#x201C;least like me&#x201D; and 4 meaning &#x201C;most like me.&#x201D;</p>

As someone accepted on full funding to a 4-year university, but whose life&#x2019;s circumstances disallowed attending college until years later, I used to dream of a stress-free college life. The reality is, college can be a meaningful place, but it can also be challenging and unpredictable. The key is to <em data-effect="italics">be your own best advocate</em>, because no one else is obliged to advocate on your behalf.</p>
                <p id="auto_626604f6-8b60-4a06-9cd4-de26c20e21dd_fs-idm212434704">&#x201C;When I began my community college studies, I knew what I wanted to do. Cybersecurity was my passion, but I had no understanding of how credits transfer over to a 4-year university. This came to haunt me later, after I navigated the complex processes of transferring between two different colleges. Not everyone involved volunteers information. It is up to you, the student, to be the squeaky wheel so you can get the grease. Visit office hours, make appointments, and schedule meetings with stakeholders so that you are not just buried under the sheaf of papers on someone&#x2019;s desk.&#x201D;</p>

                      <td>Reginald has, after much thought and with a high level of family support, decided to enroll in college. It has been a dream in the making, as he was unable to attend immediately after high school graduation. Instead, he worked several years in his family&#x2019;s business, got married, had a son, and then decided that he didn&#x2019;t want to spend the rest of his life regretting that he didn&#x2019;t get a chance to follow his dreams of becoming a teacher. Because it has been almost a decade since he sat in a classroom, he is worried about how he will fit in as an adult learner returning to college. Will his classmates think he is too old? Will his professors think he is not ready for the challenges of college work? Will his family get tired of his long nights at the library and his new priorities? There is so much Reginald is unsure of, yet he knows it&#x2019;s a step in the right direction.</td>
                      <td>It has been only three months since Madison graduated from high school. She graduated in the top 10 percent of her class, and she earned college credit while in high school. She feels academically prepared, and she has a good sense of what degree she wants to earn. Since Madison was 5 years old, she&#x2019;s wanted to be an engineer because she loved building things in the backyard with her father&#x2019;s tools. He always encouraged her to follow her dreams, and her whole family has been supportive of her hobbies and interests. However, Madison is concerned that her choice of major will keep her from dance, creative writing, and other passions. Furthermore, Madison is heading to a distant college with no other people she knows. Will she be able to find new friends quickly? Will her engineering classes crush her or motivate her to complete college? Will she be able to explore other interests? Madison has a lot on her mind, but she aims to face these challenges head-on.</td>

They are both committed to this new chapter in their lives, and they are both connected to their families in ways that can influence their commitment to this pursuit. What they don&#x2019;t know just yet&#x2014;because they haven&#x2019;t started their classes&#x2014;is that they will have even more in common as they move through each term, focus on a major, and plan for life after graduation. And they have a lot in common with you as well because you are in a similar position&#x2014;starting the next chapter of the rest of your life.</p>

This is an important first step because knowing your <em data-effect="italics">why</em> will keep you motivated. Next, the chapter will cover the transitions that you may experience as a new college student. Then, the chapter will focus on how you can acclimate to the culture and meeting the expectations&#x2014;all of which will make the transition to a full-fledged college student easier. Finally, the chapter will provide you with strategies for overcoming the challenges that you may face by providing information about how to find and access resources.</p>

Starting this chapter with <em data-effect="italics">you</em>, the student, seems to make perfect sense. Like Reginald and Madison, you are probably full of emotions as you begin this journey toward a degree and the fulfillment of a dream. Are you excited about meeting new people and <em data-effect="italics">finally</em> getting to take classes that interest you? Are you nervous about how you are going to handle your courses and all the other activities that come along with being a college student? Are you thrilled to be making important decisions about your future? Are you worried about making the right choice when deciding on a major or a career? All these thoughts, even if contradictory at times, are normal. And you may be experiencing several of them at the same time.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Why Are You in College?</h3>
          <p id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_fs-idm341100944">We know that college is not mandatory&#x2014;like kindergarten through 12th grade is&#x2014;and it is not free. You have made a <em data-effect="italics">choice</em> to commit several years of hard work to earn a degree or credential. In some cases, you may have had to work really hard to get here by getting good grades and test scores in high school and earning money to pay for tuition and fees and other expenses. Now you have more at stake and a clearer path to achieving your goals, but you still need to be able to answer the question.</p>
          <p id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_fs-idm516542352">To help answer this question, consider the following questioning technique called &#x201C;The Five Whys&#x201D; that was originally created by Sakichi Toyoda, a Japanese inventor, whose strategy was used by the Toyota Motor Company to find the underlying cause of a problem. While your decision to go to college is not a problem, the exercise is helpful to uncover your underlying purpose for enrolling in college.</p>
          <p id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_fs-idm487903344">The process starts with a &#x201C;Why&#x201D; question that you want to know the answer to. Then, the next four &#x201C;Why&#x201D; questions use a portion of the previous answer to help you dig further into the answer to the original question. Here is an example of &#x201C;The Five Whys,&#x201D; with the first question as &#x201C;Why are you in college?&#x201D; The answers and their connection to the next &#x201C;Why&#x201D; question have been underlined so you can see how the process works.</p>
          <p id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_fs-idm503765648">While the example is one from a student who knows what she wants to major in, this process does not require that you have a specific degree or career in mind. In fact, if you are undecided, then you can explore the &#x201C;why&#x201D; of your indecision. Is it because you have lots of choices, or is it because you are not sure what you really want out of college?</p>

Had she not been instructed to delve a little deeper with each answer, it is likely that she would not have so quickly articulated that deeper purpose. And that understanding of &#x201C;why&#x201D; you are in college&#x2014;beyond the degree you want or the job you envision after graduation&#x2014;is key to staying motivated through what will most likely be some challenging times</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">What Are the Rewards and Value of a College Degree?</h3>
          <p id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_fs-idm377188800">Once you have explored your &#x201C;why&#x201D; for enrolling in college, it may be worth reviewing what we know about the value of a college degree. There is no doubt you know people who have succeeded in a career without going to college. Famous examples of college dropouts include Bill Gates (the cofounder and CEO of Microsoft) and Ellen DeGeneres (comedian, actor, and television producer, among her many other roles). These are two well-known, smart, talented people who have had tremendous success on a global scale. They are also not the typical profile of a student who doesn&#x2019;t finish a degree. For many students, especially those who are first-generation college students, a college degree helps them follow a career pathway and create a life that would not have been possible without the credential. Even in this time of rapid change in all kinds of fields, including technology and education, a college degree is still worth it for many people.</p>
          <p id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_fs-idm529863120">Consider the following chart that shows an average of lifetime earnings per level of education. As you can see, the more education you receive, the greater the increase in your average lifetime earnings. Even though a degree costs a considerable amount of money on the front end, if you think about it as an investment in your future, you can see that college graduates receive a substantial return on their investment. To put it into more concrete terms, let&#x2019;s say you spend $100,000 for a four-year degree (<em data-effect="italics">Don&#x2019;t faint! That is the average sticker cost of a four-year degree at a public university if you include tuition, fees, room, and board</em>). The return on investment (ROI) over a lifetime, according to the information in the figure below, is 1,500%! You don&#x2019;t have to be a financial wizard to recognize that 1,500% return is fantastic.</p>

          <ul id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_fs-idm533092768">
            <li><strong data-effect="bold">Greater job satisfaction.</strong> That&#x2019;s right! College graduates are more likely to get a job that they like or to find that their job is more enjoyable than not.</li>
            <li><strong data-effect="bold">Better job stability.</strong> Employees with college degrees are more likely to find and keep a job, which is comforting news in times of economic uncertainty.</li>
            <li><strong data-effect="bold">Improved health and wellness.</strong> College graduates are less likely to smoke and more likely to exercise and maintain a healthy weight.</li>
            <li><strong data-effect="bold">Better outcomes for the next generation.</strong> One of the best benefits of a college degree is that it can have positive influences for the graduate&#x2019;s immediate family and the next generations.</li>

          <p id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_fs-idm368376528">One last thing: There is some debate as to whether a college degree is needed to land a job, and there are certainly jobs that you can get without a college degree. However, there are many reasons that a college degree can give you an edge in the job market. Here are just a few reasons that graduating with a degree is still valuable:</p>
          <ul id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_fs-idm335695808">
            <li>More and more entry-level jobs will require a college degree. According to Georgetown University&#x2019;s Center on Education and the Workforce, in 2020, 35% of jobs will require a college degree.<a href="#auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_ch01rfin-4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">4</a><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_ch01rfin-4"><div data-type="footnote-number">4</div>Carnevale, A.P., Smith, N., &amp; Strohl, J.

            <li>A credential from a college or university still provides assurance that a student has mastered the material. Would you trust a doctor who never went to medical school to do open-heart surgery on a close relative? No, we didn&#x2019;t think so.</li>
            <li>College provides an opportunity to develop much-needed soft skills. The National Association of Colleges and Employers has identified eight career-readiness competencies that college students should develop: critical thinking/problem solving, oral/written communication, teamwork/collaboration, digital technology, leadership, professionalism/work ethic, career management, and global/intercultural fluency.<a href="#auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_ch01rfin-5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">5</a> There are few occasions that will provide you the opportunity to develop all of these skills in a low-stakes environment (i.e., without the fear of being fired!).

          <h3 data-type="title">Why This Course?</h3>
          <p id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_fs-idm365348688">Now that you have considered why you are in college and why a college degree may be valuable to you, it&#x2019;s time to focus on why you are reading this book. Most likely, you are enrolled in a course that is helping you learn about college and how to make the most of it. You may be asking yourself &#x201C;Why am I taking this course?&#x201D; or even &#x201C;Why do I have to read this book?&#x201D; Answers to the first question may vary, depending on your college&#x2019;s requirements for first-year students. Nevertheless, you are probably taking this course because your college believes that it will <em data-effect="italics">help you succeed in college and beyond</em>. Likewise, the reason your professor has assigned this book is because it has been designed to give you the best information about how to make your transition to college a little smoother. If you are not convinced just yet of the value of this course and its content, consider the following questions that you will be encouraged to answer as you learn about how to succeed in college:</p>
          <ul id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_fs-idm367105904">
            <li>What will college expect of me in terms of skills, habits, and behaviors, and how can I develop them to ensure that I am successful?</li>
            <li>What do I need to know about how to navigate the process of completing a college degree?</li>
            <li>How can I ensure that I develop worthy long-term goals, and how best can I meet those goals?</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_a882fede-a0ac-4450-8cd9-781675a302e4_fs-idm394157328">These questions are designed to assist you in the transition from high school, or the workforce, to the new world of college. And this won&#x2019;t be the last monumental transition that you will experience. For example, you will experience a new job more than once in your life, and you may experience the excitement and challenge of moving to a new house or a new city. You can be assured that transitions will require that you identify what you need to get through them and that you will experience some discomfort along the way. It wouldn&#x2019;t be such a great accomplishment without a little uncertainty, doubt, and self-questioning. To help you, the next section speaks specifically to transitions for the purpose of making your next steps a little smoother.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Adjustments to College Are Inevitable</h3>
          <p id="auto_6c30d0cc-e435-4081-be68-5ff2f558cbec_fs-idm341021040" class="has-noteref">College not only will expand your mind, but it may also make you a little uncomfortable, challenge your identity, and at times, make you doubt your abilities. It is hard to truly learn anything without getting messy. This is what education does: it transforms us. For that to happen, however, means that we will need to be open to the transformation and allow the changes to occur. <em data-effect="italics">Flexibility</em>, <em data-effect="italics">transition</em>, and <em data-effect="italics">change</em> are all words that describe what you will experience. Laurie Hazard and Stephanie Carter (2018)<a href="#auto_6c30d0cc-e435-4081-be68-5ff2f558cbec_ch01rfin-6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">6</a> use the word <em data-effect="italics">adjustment</em>. Hazard and Carter (2018) believe there are six adjustment areas that first-year college students experience: academic, cultural, emotional, financial, intellectual, and social. Of course, you won&#x2019;t go through these adjustments all at once or even in just the first year. Some will take time, while others may not even feel like much of a transition. Let&#x2019;s look at them in brief as a way of preparing for the road ahead:</p>
          <aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_6c30d0cc-e435-4081-be68-5ff2f558cbec_ch01rfin-6"><div data-type="footnote-number">6</div>Hazard, L., &amp; Carter, S. (2018). A framework for helping families understand the college transition. <em data-effect="italics">E-Source for College Transitions</em>, 16(1), 13-15.</aside>
          <ul id="auto_6c30d0cc-e435-4081-be68-5ff2f558cbec_fs-idm520552016">
            <li><em data-effect="italics">Academic adjustment</em>. No surprises here. You will most likely&#x2014;depending on your own academic background&#x2014;be faced with the increased demands of learning in college. This could mean that you need to spend more time learning to learn and using those strategies to master the material.</li>
            <li><em data-effect="italics">Cultural adjustment.</em> You also will most likely experience a cultural adjustment just by being in college because most campuses have their own language (<em data-effect="italics">syllabus</em>, <em data-effect="italics">registrar</em>, and <em data-effect="italics">office hours</em>, for example) and customs. You may also experience a cultural adjustment because of the diversity that you will encounter. Most likely, the people on your college campus will be different than the people at your high school&#x2014;or at your workplace.</li>
            <li><em data-effect="italics">Emotional adjustment.</em> Remember the range of emotions presented at the beginning of the chapter? Those will likely be present in some form throughout your first weeks in college and at stressful times during the semester. Knowing that you may have good days and bad&#x2014;and that you can bounce back from the more stressful days&#x2014;will help you find healthy ways of adjusting emotionally.</li>
            <li><em data-effect="italics">Financial adjustment</em>. Most students understand the investment they are making in their future by going to college. Even if you have all your expenses covered, there is still an adjustment to a new way of thinking about what college costs and how to pay for it. You may find that you think twice about spending money on entertainment or that you have improved your skills in finding discounted textbooks.</li>
            <li><em data-effect="italics">Intellectual adjustment</em>. Experiencing an intellectual &#x201C;a-ha!&#x201D; moment is one of the most rewarding parts of college, right up there with moving across the graduation stage with a degree in hand. Prepare to be surprised when you stumble across a fascinating subject or find that a class discussion changes your life. At the very least, through your academic work, you will learn to think differently about the world around you and your place in it.</li>
            <li><em data-effect="italics">Social adjustment</em>. A new place often equals new people. But in college, those new relationships can have even more meaning. Getting to know professors not only can help you learn more in your classes, but it can also help you figure out what career pathway you want to take and how to get desired internships and jobs. Learning to reduce conflicts during group work or when living with others helps build essential workplace and life skills.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 data-type="title">College Has Its Own Language and Customs</h3>
          <p id="auto_968477b5-6227-41c4-9382-2e2cf2e146a1_fs-idm399482048">Going to college&#x2014;even if you are not far from home&#x2014;is a cultural experience. It comes with its own language and customs, some of which can be confusing or confounding at first. Just like traveling to a foreign country, it is best if you prepare by learning what words mean and what you are expected to say and do in certain situations.</p>
          <p id="auto_968477b5-6227-41c4-9382-2e2cf2e146a1_fs-idm520724032">Let&#x2019;s first start with the language you may encounter. In most cases, there will be words that you have heard before, but they may have different meanings in a college setting. Take, for instance, &#x201C;office hours.&#x201D; If you are not in college, you would think that it means the hours of a day that an office is open. If it is your dentist&#x2019;s office, it may mean Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. In college, &#x201C;office hours&#x201D; can refer to the specific hours a professor is in her office to meet with students, and those hours may be only a few each day: for example, Mondays and Wednesdays from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m.</p>
          <p id="auto_968477b5-6227-41c4-9382-2e2cf2e146a1_fs-idm399168816">&#x201C;Syllabus&#x201D; is another word that you may not have encountered, but it is one you will soon know very well. A syllabus is often called the &#x201C;contract of the course&#x201D; because it contains information about what to expect&#x2014;from the professor and the student. It is meant to be a roadmap for succeeding in the class. Understanding that office hours are for you to ask your professor questions and the syllabus is the guide for what you will be doing in the class can make a big difference in your transition to college.

Terms such as &#x201C;quad&#x201D; or &#x201C;union&#x201D; can denote a location or space for students. Then there may be terms such as &#x201C;TLC&#x201D; (The Learning Center, in this example) that designate a specific building or office. Describe a few of the new terms you have encountered so far and what they mean. If you are not sure, ask your professor or a fellow student to define it for you.</p>

For example, you may be familiar with what a teacher did when you were in high school, but do you know what a professor does? It certainly seems like they fulfill a very similar role as teachers in high school, but in college professors&#x2019; roles are often much more diverse. In addition to teaching, they may also conduct research, mentor graduate students, write and review research articles, serve on and lead campus committees, serve in regional and national organizations in their disciplines, apply for and administer grants, advise students in their major, and serve as sponsors for student organizations. You can be assured that their days are far from routine. See the Table on Differences between High School Teachers and College Professors for just a few differences between high school teachers and college professors.</p>

You will rely on them to help you find internships, write letters of recommendation, nominate you for honors or awards, and serve as references for jobs. You can develop those relationships by participating in class, visiting during office hours, asking for assistance with coursework, requesting recommendations for courses and majors, and getting to know the professor&#x2019;s own academic interests. One way to think about the change in how your professors will relate to you is to think about the nature of relationships you have had growing up. In Figure 1.X: You and Your Relationships Before College you will see a representation of what your relationships probably looked like. Your family may have been the greatest influencer on you and your development.</p>

These relationships are important because they will allow you to expand your network, especially as it relates to your career. As stated earlier, developing relationships with faculty can provide you with more than just the benefits of a mentor. Faculty often review applications for on-campus jobs or university scholarships and awards; they also have connections with graduate programs, companies, and organizations. They may recommend you to colleagues or former classmates for internships and even jobs.</p>

Because it is not an exhaustive list of the differences, be mindful of other differences you may notice. Also, if your most recent experience has been the world of work or the military, you may find that there are more noticeable differences between those experiences and college.</p>

Nonetheless, some students struggle at first because they don&#x2019;t know about these habits, behaviors, and strategies. But once they learn them, they are able to meet them with ease.</p>

                <li><strong data-effect="bold">Deliberate, focused effort.</strong> Taking ownership of learning will hinge on the effort that you put into the work. Because most learning in college will take place outside of the classroom, you will need determination to get the work done. And there will be times that the work will be challenging and maybe even boring, but finding a way to get through it when it is not exciting will pay in the long run.</li>
                <li><strong data-effect="bold">Time and task management.</strong> You will learn more about strategies for managing your time and the tasks of college in a later chapter, but without the ability to control your calendar, it will be difficult to block out the time to study.</li>
                <li><strong data-effect="bold">Progress tracking.</strong> A commitment to learning must include monitoring your learning, knowing not only what you have completed (<em data-effect="italics">this is where a good time management strategy can help you track your tasks</em>), but also the quality of the work you have done.</li>

However, if you have any difficulty making this adjustment, you can and should reach out for help along the way.</p>

Review the table on First-Year College Student Milestones.

You will meet new people, including classmates, college staff, and professors. You may also be living in a different environment, which may mean that a roommate is another new person to get to know. Overall, you will most likely feel both excited and nervous. You can be assured that even if the beginning of the semester goes smoothly, your classes will get more challenging each week. You will be making friends, learning who in your classes seem to know what is going on, and figuring your way around campus. You may even walk into the wrong building, go to the wrong class, or have trouble finding what you need during this time. But those first-week jitters will end soon. Students who are living away from home for the first time can feel homesick in the first few weeks, and others can feel what is called &#x201C;imposter syndrome,&#x201D; which is a fear some students have that they don&#x2019;t belong in college because they don&#x2019;t have the necessary skills for success. Those first few weeks sound pretty stressful, but the stress is temporary.</p>
          <p id="auto_968477b5-6227-41c4-9382-2e2cf2e146a1_fs-idm344709440">After the newness of college wears off, reality will set in. You may find that the courses and assignments do not seem much different than they did in high school (more on that later), but you may be in for a shock when you get your graded tests and papers. Many new college students find that their first grades are lower than they expected. For some students, this may mean they have earned a B when they are used to earning As, but for many students, it means they may experience their first <em data-effect="italics">failing or almost-failing grades</em> in college because they have not used active, effective study strategies; instead, they studied how they did in high school, which is often insufficient. This can be a shock if you are not prepared, but it doesn&#x2019;t have to devastate you if you are willing to use it as a wake-up call to do something different.</p>
          <p id="auto_968477b5-6227-41c4-9382-2e2cf2e146a1_fs-idm378531856">By the middle of the semester, you&#x2019;ll likely feel much more confident and a little more relaxed. Your grades are improving because you started going to tutoring and using better study strategies. You are looking ahead, even beyond the first semester, to start planning your courses for the next term. If you are working while in college, you may also find that you have a rhythm down for balancing it all; additionally, your time management skills have likely improved.</p>
          <p id="auto_968477b5-6227-41c4-9382-2e2cf2e146a1_fs-idm382237696">By the last few weeks of the semester, you will be focused on the increasing importance of your assignments and upcoming finals and trying to figure out how to juggle that with the family obligations of the impending holidays. You may feel a little more pressure to prepare for finals, as this time is often viewed as the most stressful period of the semester. All of this additional workload and need to plan for the next semester can seem overwhelming, but if you plan ahead and use what you learn from this chapter and the rest of the course, you will be able to get through it more easily.</p>

What if they found that the first few weeks were a little harder than they had anticipated? Should they have given up and dropped out? Or should they have talked to someone about their struggles? Here is a secret about college success that not many people know: successful students seek help. They use resources. And they do that as often as necessary to get what they need. Your professors and advisors will expect the same from you, and your college will have all kinds of offices, staff, and programs that are designed to help. This bears calling out again: <em data-effect="italics">you need to use those resources</em>. These are called &#x201C;help-seeking behaviors,&#x201D; and along with self-advocacy, which is speaking up for your needs, they are essential to your success. As you get more comfortable adjusting to life in college, you will find that asking for help is easier. In fact, you may become really good at it by the time you graduate, just in time for you to ask for help finding a job! Review the table on Issues, Campus Resources, and Potential Outcomes for a few examples of times you may need to ask for help. See if you can identify where on campus you can find the same or a similar resource.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Common Challenges in the First Year</h3>
          <p id="auto_968477b5-6227-41c4-9382-2e2cf2e146a1_fs-idm396390144">It seems fitting to follow up the expectations for the first year with a list of common challenges that college students encounter along the way to a degree. If you experience any&#x2014;or even all&#x2014;of these, the important point here is that you are not alone and that you can overcome them by using your resources. Many college students have felt like this before, and they have survived&#x2014;even thrived&#x2014;despite them because they were able to identify a strategy or resource that they could use to help themselves. At some point in your academic career, you may do one or more of the following:</p>
          <ol id="auto_968477b5-6227-41c4-9382-2e2cf2e146a1_fs-idm338764272">
            <li><strong data-effect="bold">Feel like an imposter.</strong> There is actually a name for this condition: <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_968477b5-6227-41c4-9382-2e2cf2e146a1_term3" group-by="i">imposter syndrome</span>. Students who feel like an imposter are worried that they don&#x2019;t belong, that someone will &#x201C;expose them for being a fake.&#x201D; This feeling is pretty common for anyone who finds themselves in a new environment and is not sure if they have what it takes to succeed. Trust the professionals who work with first-year college students: you <em data-effect="italics">do</em> have what it takes, and you <em data-effect="italics">will</em> succeed. Just give yourself time to get adjusted to everything.</li>
            <li><strong data-effect="bold">Worry about making a mistake.</strong> This concern often goes with imposter syndrome. Students who worry about making a mistake don&#x2019;t like to answer questions in class, volunteer for a challenging assignment, and even ask for help from others. Instead of avoiding situations where you may fail, embrace the process of learning, which includes&#x2014;is even dependent on&#x2014;making mistakes. The more you practice courage in these situations and focus on what you are going to learn from failing, the more confident you become about your abilities.</li>
            <li><strong data-effect="bold">Try to manage everything yourself.</strong> Even superheroes need help from sidekicks and mere mortals. Trying to handle everything on your own every time an issue arises is a recipe for getting stressed out. There will be times when you are overwhelmed by all you have to do. This is when you will need to ask for and allow others to help you.</li>
            <li><strong data-effect="bold">Ignore your mental and physical health needs.</strong> If you feel you are on an emotional rollercoaster and you cannot find time to take care of yourself, then you have most likely ignored some part of your mental and physical well-being. What you need to do to stay healthy should be non-negotiable. In other words, your sleep, eating habits, exercise, and stress-reducing activities should be your highest priorities.</li>
            <li><strong data-effect="bold">Forget to enjoy the experience.</strong> Whether you are 18 years old and living on campus or 48 years old starting back to college after taking a break to work and raise a family, be sure to take the time to remind yourself of the joy that learning can bring.</li>

But you can be assured that each of them will demonstrate grit, the ability to stay focused on a goal over the long-term, along the way. As Duckworth (2016) has said, it takes passion and perseverance to be gritty. It also takes resilience, or the ability to bounce back from adversity. The challenges you face will certainly stretch you, but if you have these three things&#x2014;purpose, strategies, and resources&#x2014;you will be more likely to bounce back, even become stronger in the process. This book has been designed with these things in mind.</p>

          <p id="auto_094c8f0e-58bb-4f33-8390-a4e0ba99e94b_fs-idm357474080">This chapter provides an introduction to the transition to college by first asking &#x201C;Why?&#x201D; Understanding why you are in college and what a college degree can do for you is the foundation of making a smooth transition. These transitional experiences are part of being in college, and this chapter provides you with information about what to expect and how to handle the changes you will go through. Next, the chapter discusses college culture and how to understand the customs and language of higher education. The chapter ends with resources throughout the text that can help you practice skills and dive deeper into the topics.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">What Is the Difference between Information and Knowledge?</h3>
          <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm645548992">Life is a series of problems needing solutions. We need to find information that matters and then discover why it matters. Curiosity, then, is a response to an environment of exploration, manifesting in wanting to know &#x201C;why&#x201D; or &#x201C;how.&#x201D; How do you make sense of the world? How does information translate to knowledge? Connecting ideas, thinking critically, acting responsibly, and communicating effectively are all essential to lifelong learning and active engagement in today&#x2019;s world. You need to become proficient, ethical users and producers of information in a globally connected world. It is important to be able to reason, manage resources, work productively with others, acquire and evaluate information effectively, organize information, interpret and communicate the information, and work with an ever-evolving variety of technologies. In other words, you need to become information-savvy consumers and producers. You need to be able to adapt to, understand, evaluate, and make use of technology so you can be citizens that shape our society, rather than being its pawns. What you learn is often what you will want to communicate to others.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">What Is Information Literacy?</h3>
          <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm216579040">Human beings are passionate, curious, and always seeking to connect with each other and make sense of things. Learning is more effective when new information is meaningful and linked to some personal experience or prior knowledge. Learning is about both context and content. It is necessary to learn how to assess, evaluate, and connect in order to make information become knowledge. Information literacy skills are the hallmark of the ability to do research. What is important is for you to learn how to find information that &#x201C;matters&#x201D; and then figure out why it might matter. </p>
          <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm210703440">Information literacy is a link between the life experiences of you as a student, the academic world of scholarship, and the postcollege real world of application of learning. An information-literate person has the ability to ask questions and knows the difference between ignorance and understanding. (When do I need information?) Information literacy builds a lifelong ability to determine where information is kept (Where is the best place to find this?) and in what forms knowledge is stored (Which knowledge products will likely have what I need?).</p>
          <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm262550720">Information literacy relies on the use of a critical mind to discern credible from not credible, valid from not valid. It is actually the core of the first-year experience. It lasts, while the specifics of particular courses fade over time. After all, the nature of research, the core of higher education, is a learning process: &#x201C;How do I learn about something?&#x201D; Communication skills are essential to your ability to both learn and share what you&#x2019;ve learned.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">What Are the Steps to a Good Research Study?</h3>
          <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm253151424">Research is a part of life. In fact, you conduct <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_term1" group-by="r">research</span> daily. You look things up whenever you want a hotel or a good restaurant in a new city, or a recipe for cookies you&#x2019;d like to make for a party. Sometimes you use Google for answers, and other times you ask people to help you answer your question. At times you might need to visit specific websites to find good information on the kind of used car you should buy or tickets to a sporting event or concert you hope to attend. All of this is part of research at its most basic level&#x2014;asking a question and then answering it. Research can be defined as an activity that produces new knowledge. However, it is not timeless. Questions change, and so do answers. New questions bring new light to bear on any topic or issue. For example, consider the way we have controlled the use of pesticides. Over time, we moved from acceptance to shock and now horror at some of the side effects. It is new information on pesticides that has influenced our change in thinking. And the reason we know this information is that someone did the research and then communicated it to our community through newscasts, newspapers, online sites, and so forth.</p>
          <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm646432128">We often accept ideas as fact. For instance, how do we come to believe such things as &#x201C;Three out of four dentists recommend . . . &#x201D; or &#x201C;McDonald&#x2019;s french fries are preferred three to one over . . .&#x201D;? Or that heroin is addictive, or that putting infants in car seats prevents fatal injuries, or that drinking while pregnant can be harmful? It is important to know that these statements are the result of questions that led to serious research. Understanding the methods used to do research will help us understand how we come to know what we know. In cases such as these, someone was interested in knowing the answer to a particular question, planned a research study, and then published the findings. When people do this kind of research, their purpose is not only to find an answer but also to communicate what they found to the rest of us. They are communicating new knowledge.</p>
          <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm247879584">Research is exploration and the search for possible answers to questions. Most students think research is about finding answers, but it is more about the questions we ask that lead us to the answers. Good research starts with good questions. Researchers ask themselves a question, create a possible answer in the form of a hypothesis, and then begin a process of gathering information with a methodology. If we understand how important questions are to doing research, we are then better able to determine the credibility and validity of the information sources we use. When evaluating sources, we can ask: Why should I believe this author? What does she know that makes her someone I should pay attention to? And when deciding on credibility, we can ask: What did the author do to convince me his answer is the correct one? Did the evidence really match the question the author was asking? Thus, information literacy is the ability to evaluate sources on the basis of what questions were asked, determine if those are the best questions to ask, assess whether the answers offered really answer the questions, and decide if the author is prepared to answer those questions well. Remember the literacies that Howard Rheingold suggested in the &#x201C;Communicating&#x201D; chapter. Using these as guides leads us to mindfully explore the vast array of information available to us. And when we do so, we won&#x2019;t find ourselves taking information at face value and passing it on as though it were valid, like some of the &#x201C;fake news&#x201D; that is prevalent today.</p>
          <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm251969360">So let&#x2019;s start the process of doing research. The activity below will help you begin the process. After this, you will be introduced to the simple steps you need to take to do the research and then communicate your findings appropriately.</p>

Secondly, some knowledge products might be considered <em data-effect="italics">professional</em>. These are written for professionals in a field, the author is most often identified, sources are not always documented, and the language may or may not be technical. Finally, there are <em data-effect="italics">popular</em> knowledge products, which communicate a broad range of information. The author is often not identified, sources are often not documented, and language is not technical. Because they are commercial products packaged for wide sales, they often use color and have numerous ads.</p>

When doing research, you also have to incorporate the information you find for specific purposes, acknowledge the sources, and provide citations. To make this easier to understand, think of scholarly writing as a simple story told with a particular set of conventions (rules). What are these conventions? They are: a research question, a hypothesis, a methodology, a review of the literature, an interpretation of your work, and an analysis of the significance of what you&#x2019;ve found.</p>

So begin by thinking of something that is really interesting to you. Let&#x2019;s take music for an example. You need to ask some questions about music to start the process. Some examples of questions are:</p>

Usually, a scholarly question identifies a problem and a solution. Such questions are usually written in the form of a hypothesis, which is a statement about the relationship between two things that identifies both a problem and an answer or solution. An example of a hypothesis would be: Different genres of music have an effect on the mood of the people listening to them. The questions asked to get to this hypothesis might be: Does music have an effect on mood? Do people listen to music to make them feel better? What kind of music is used as a way to energize the listener? Is there one type of music that is better than others for calming someone down?</p>

In order to arrive at a hypothesis that achieves this goal, you must learn as much as possible about your topic so you can narrow down your hypotheses to what you don&#x2019;t know. Then your research project will produce new knowledge. <em data-effect="italics">Your hypothesis is about what you don&#x2019;t know</em>. However, you might find that you can&#x2019;t prove your hypothesis. You might find evidence that contradicts it, and you will have to reflect on why your hypothesis might have been wrong.</p>

This means that you need to learn how to question, evaluate, and determine the worth, credibility, and relevance of what you, as a student, find. Thus, when doing research, you need that hypothesis to begin the rest of your research.</p>
            <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm255441584">The next step is to come up with key words or concepts that describe your topic. Start by preparing an outline for yourself. List the key words (for instance, on the topic of music, some key words might be<em data-effect="italics"> music</em>, <em data-effect="italics">instruments</em>, <em data-effect="italics">genres</em>, <em data-effect="italics">musicians</em>, and so on). Then create a list of narrower terms, which are more specific things that you want to know about your topic, such as <em data-effect="italics">time frames</em>, <em data-effect="italics">geography</em>, <em data-effect="italics">population</em>, and <em data-effect="italics">age groups</em>. Finally, you can list broader terms that are the larger subjects that include your key words. For music these could be <em data-effect="italics">cultural expression</em>, <em data-effect="italics">jazz</em>, <em data-effect="italics">hip-hop</em>, <em data-effect="italics">singers</em>, and so forth. Your methodology will be a compilation of the sources you decide to review. It is an orderly approach to problem solving and gathering useful data, using such sources and strategies as interviews, public documents, surveys, experiments, the Internet, and many more.</p>
            <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm263961216">The kind of methodology you decide to use depends on the type of research you will be conducting. You could do <em data-effect="italics">exploratory research</em>, which basically answers the question &#x201C;Does something exist?&#x201D; This &#x201C;something&#x201D; could be an event, a thing, or an idea, such as a concert or music designed for relaxation. Or perhaps you want to do <em data-effect="italics">descriptive research</em>, which is the kind of study that defines something by describing its characteristics, behaviors, or actions. For instance, you could describe a genre of music, how it was created, and what instruments are usually used to compose this type of music. A third type of research you may want to do is called <em data-effect="italics">prediction research</em>, which involves identifying relationships that make it possible for us to speculate about one thing by knowing about something else. Music has taken many turns over time, and you might want to suggest that the next phase of music might all be electronically produced. And finally, you could choose to do <em data-effect="italics">explanatory research</em>. This type of research examines cause-and-effect relationships. For example, there is music created to tell a particular story in a specific manner. This might be true of rap music. To study this, you would use explanatory research to describe this phenomenon.</p>

The literature in a particular field is its <em data-effect="italics">discourse</em>, which is actually a conversation over time about a topic. When you do your literature review, you are inserting yourself in the middle of such a conversation and getting information only from that particular time and perspective. For instance, if you want to study the effects of music on children, you will find a wide variety of sources that will give you information about the topic. You will discover that many people have been interested in the issue and have done studies trying to find out the answer. These studies have been done over many years, and the perspectives involved have changed accordingly. The discourse continues over time, and you can insert information into the conversation by conducting your own research.</p>

              <li>shows similarities and differences between studies.</li>
              <li>discriminates between relevant and irrelevant information.</li>
              <li>indicates weaknesses in previous work.</li>

Synthesis results from weaving together many smaller generalizations and interpretations into a coherent main theme. You will find that a literature review is always required of an assigned research paper for a course. The purpose is to enable you to critically analyze a segment of an already published body of knowledge. A comprehensive literature review encompasses the following elements:</p>

It is so easy to read through many other people&#x2019;s work and grab a sentence here and there to put into your own paper. As you&#x2019;re struggling to come up with ideas, you may also find yourself borrowing from others. Neither of these is a good idea.</p>
            <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm210579408">Plagiarism often starts with the note-taking stage of the research process. Thus, when taking notes, be sure to distinguish between paraphrases and direct quotations. When you are copying an exact quotation, be extremely precise. Note all the information you will need for the citation. It is a good idea to make a system for yourself, perhaps color coding, when doing your research. Make direct quotations one color and your own paraphrasing of ideas another color. Both quotations and paraphrases need to be cited with sources, both within the paper and at the end.</p>
            <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm223389648">Learning how to use the ideas of others to add weight to your own ideas involves effort and a commitment to academic honesty. It is not always clear exactly how or when to use sources, and sometimes you might need advice or guidance. Since your professors are most familiar with the expectations of their disciplines, they are the best people to ask. Your college likely offers support in the writing lab or online. If you need more guidance, the Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL) has a section on <a href="https://openstax.org/l/avoidingplagiarism" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">safe practices for researching and drafting</a>, where you can find excellent advice on identifying plagiarism and preventing yourself from plagiarizing.</p>

Doing so can help you avoid any unintentional reuse of others&#x2019; work and may simply identify a source you forgot to cite. <a href="https://www.chegg.com/writing" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chegg Writing</a> allows you to upload or paste in your paper for a detailed source evaluation.

There are many ways you can check the validity of a piece of information. Can you find contradictory or confirmatory data? Can you find evidence that disputes what you are reading? If so, use this information. It is always useful to mention opposing ideas. Ultimately, doing so might strengthen your own ideas. Is the topic within the expertise of the person offering the information? Was the method chosen to convey this information the best method to use? The credibility of the author is another important aspect of checking your sources. In other words, evaluate the authors. Are they experts on the topic? Do they have credentials to write on this particular topic? Has this author written anything else on this topic?</p>
            <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm238271968">Evidence is the way we show that we are using the experiences, values, research, and perspectives of others. To be information literate is to apply the concepts of subjective and objective evidence to our selection, use, and evaluation of information. When we read a website or view a television program, can we recognize that a particular set of values and perspectives is being used? Are we able to identify when evidence is being used? Can we determine that the evidence being used shows a relevant connection between values, perspectives, and conclusions? Are enough different values and perspectives being presented that the conclusions can be considered objective? It is important to learn how to determine the validity and credibility of sources.</p>
            <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm238574448">The Internet presents its own challenges when it comes to discovering valid and credible information. When looking at a website, you should be able to answer the following questions: Who is responsible for the site (i.e., who is the author)? What can you find out about the responsible party? Where does the site&#x2019;s information come from (e.g., opinions, facts, documents, quotes, excerpts)? What are the key concepts, issues, and &#x201C;facts&#x201D; on the site? And finally, can the key elements of the site be verified by another site or source? In other words, if you want to find some information online, you shouldn&#x2019;t just Google the topic and then depend on the first website that pops up.</p>
            <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm248500416">For certain topics and types of information, you may need to dig deeper. Take into account the funding behind a website. Look up the author, and see if they have written anything else and if there are any obvious biases present in that writing. As an example, if you find a website about vaccinations and autism, and this website was put up by a parent group that opposes vaccinations, you have found information that has biases built in from the start. The point of view presented is most likely one-sided, and thus you need to look for more balanced sources to learn if there is in fact some relationship between childhood vaccinations and the onset of autism. This is just an example; you can find sources ranging from reasonably trustworthy to totally untrustworthy on any topic.</p>

          <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm261986656">When giving an oral presentation, you should pay special attention to voice, body, and attitude. If you take the following tips into consideration, you should do a fine job of conveying your ideas to an audience.</p>
          <section data-depth="3" id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm647915648">
            <h5 data-type="title">Voice</h5>
            <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm247486032">Voice is more than the sum of the noises you make as you speak. Pay attention to inflection, which is the change in pitch or loudness of your voice. You can deliberately use inflection to make a point, to get people&#x2019;s attention, or to make it very obvious that what you are saying right now is important. You can also change the volume of your voice. Speak too softly, and people will think you are shy or unwilling to share your ideas; speak too loudly, and people will think you are shouting at them. Control your volume to fit the audience.</p>
            <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm218104128">Some people have a tendency to rush through their <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_term3" group-by="p">presentations</span>. This means they speed up their speech, and the audience has a difficult time following along. Take care to control the speed at which you give a presentation so that everyone can listen comfortably. Also, to add to the comfort of the listeners, it is always nice to use a conversational tone in a presentation.</p>

How do you stand when you are giving a presentation? Do you move around and fidget? Do you look down at the ground or stare at your note cards? Are you chewing gum or sticking your hands in and out of your pockets nervously? Obviously, you don&#x2019;t want to do any of these things. Make eye contact as often as possible. Stand in a comfortable manner, but don&#x2019;t fidget. Use gestures sparingly to make certain points.</p>

If you are bored by your own words, the audience will be yawning. If you are jazzed by what you have to offer, they will sit up in their seats and listen intently. Also, be interested in your audience. Let them know that you are excited to share your ideas with them because they are worth your effort.</p>

          <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm236065456">You might also think about using technology to make your presentation. Perhaps you will do a slide presentation in addition to orally communicating your ideas to your class or another group. Keep in mind that the best presentations are those with minimal words or pictures on the screen, just enough to illustrate the information conveyed in your oral presentation. Do a search on lecture slides or presentation slides to find myriad suggestions on how to create them effectively. You may also create videos to communicate what you found in your research. Today, there are many different ways to take the information you found and create something memorable with which to share your knowledge.</p>
          <p id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm253202288">When you are making a presentation that includes a visual component, pay attention to three elements: design, method, and function.</p>
          <section data-depth="3" id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm249161552">

          <section data-depth="3" id="auto_681faf8e-c14d-4949-b9e3-fc01268a3849_fs-idm248614048">

Will it be better to show your ideas by drawing a picture, including a photograph, using clip art, or showing a video? Or will it be more powerful to depict your ideas through a range of colors or shapes? These decisions you make will alter the impact of your presentation. Will you present your ideas literally, as with a photograph, or in the abstract, as in some artistic rendition of an idea? For instance, if you decide to introduce your ideas symbolically, a picture of a pond surrounded by tall trees may be the best way to present the concept of a calm person.</p>

Creating movement for the audience to follow? Summarizing an idea? Motivating people to agree with an idea? Supporting and confirming what you are telling your audience? Knowing the function of the visual element of your presentation will make your decisions about design and method more meaningful and successful.</p>
