        <h3 data-type="title">Foreword: The Intangible Advantage</h3>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_fs-idm380356592">I did not start out to be an inventor.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-147">I wanted to be a doctor. That&#x2019;s all I ever wanted to be, ever since the day I sat at my grandmother&#x2019;s kitchen table&#x2014;I must have been seven years old&#x2014;and smelled her flesh burning on the stove. You see, my grandmother suffered from syringomyelia, a crippling spinal disease that results in terrible back pain and the loss of sensation to pain and temperature in the extremities, especially the hands. When I saw the flames licking up through her fingers that day, I screamed, and she quickly doused her hand in the sink.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-281">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201D; she told me. &#x201C;One day you&#x2019;ll become a doctor and you&#x2019;ll fix me.&#x201D;</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-319">Some 20 years later, I had graduated medical school and completed a residency in orthopedic surgery, and was doing a fellowship in spinal surgery at St. Luke&#x2019;s Medical Center in Houston when I stumbled upon a problem in an
  otherwise routine case. The case was a discectomy&#x2014;the removal of a ruptured disk that is pressing on a nerve root. I noticed that because the disc had ruptured slowly over time, it had created a bone spur, which was like a little rhinoceros horn of
  bone, as hard as ivory. So I asked myself, How is taking out that disc going to help the patient if the bone spur is going to cause him pain for the rest of his life?</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-15">I wanted to take that bone spur out, but I knew of no way to do that because it was sticking straight up about five inches down inside a narrow little hole in the patient&#x2019;s back. So I asked a very famous surgeon in the hospital, &#x201C;How do you get that bone spur out?&#x201D;</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-605">&#x201C;Do not put a high speed burr in there and attempt to grind it down,&#x201D; he said. He had tried that once, and ended up damaging the patient&#x2019;s spinal cord and paralyzing her for life. That sounded to me like a pretty strong argument against trying that approach again.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-795">Then I asked the head of my fellowship program, &#x201C;How do I get that bone spur out?&#x201D; He explained that he once tried using a grabber instrument called a ronguer to try to break off the bone spur. But the pressure exerted on the instrument caused it to explode, sending fragments all throughout the dural sac. Luckily, he was able to retrieve the pieces and repair the damage. But once again, here was an approach that didn&#x2019;t exactly recommend itself.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-344">No matter which spine expert I asked, the response was always the same. They all told me what <em data-effect="italics"><u data-effect="underline">not</u></em> to do. Leave the bone spur alone, they said&#x2014;just sew up the patient and send him home, even if it means dooming him to a lifetime of pain. Be content to follow the age-old motto of the physician, &#x201C;First, do no harm.&#x201D;</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-496">Be content? George Bernard Shaw once said that inventors are a disgruntled lot. And I must have been pretty disgruntled with the lack of any solution for that bone spur, because I decided to invent a solution myself.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-742">Instead of trying to grind down the spur (with potentially disastrous results) or break it off (again, with potentially disastrous results), I came up with a counterintuitive approach. You see, I realized that while a bone spur itself is the hardest bone known to man, it sits atop the vertebrae, the inside of which is much softer and more mesh-like. What if I tried tapping the spur into the softer vertebrae?</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-25">I found a tool normally used for an entirely different purpose and thought it might suffice for the job. And the next time I had a discectomy case with a bone spur, I tried out my new tool.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-482">I tapped the bone spur lightly with it, but nothing happened. I tapped it again, harder, but still nothing happened. Then I tapped it really hard, and that&#x2019;s when I heard a &#x201C;pop&#x201D; and felt the instrument suddenly sink down. Now, I knew I couldn&#x2019;t have damaged any nerves or structures because I had retractors holding the nerve and the dural sac out of the way. But when I looked inside, I could not see the bone spur anywhere. It was gone. And I thought, &#x201C;Uh-oh.&#x201D;</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-411">So I brought in an x-ray machine and looked for the bone spur. It turned out the spur had corked the very hole that I had created when I broke it off and pushed it into the vertebrae&#x2014;like a cork in a bottle. There wasn&#x2019;t a drop of blood anywhere, and no damage to any tissue. In other words, my procedure was self-sealing! To this day, it remains the best solution for this problem.
  </p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-826">Over the next few months, I designed a set of instruments better suited to removing bone spurs no matter where they were located in the spinal canal. I gave the drawings to a machinist, and he created the tools according to my design. Soon I was using them routinely on bone spur cases, and getting such good results that other surgeons started sending me their bone spur cases.
  </p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-217">But eventually, these surgeons began asking me to provide them with a set of tools of their own. I said sure, and for each request, I would ask my machinist to fabricate another set of tools. Finally, the machinist told me that it would be cheaper just to make a hundred sets at once, since the major cost of fabricating the tools was in setting up the jigs on the machine.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-529">I thought that made perfect sense. After all, the demand for the tools from other surgeons was growing. In addition, I was disgruntled enough with the standard of care in other areas of spinal treatment that I had already invented several other new spinal surgery tools. So I started a little company to sell my tools and devices.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-516">I quickly realized, of course, that I needed to patent my inventions to protect all the time, money, and effort that I had invested to develop them. After all, if you don&#x2019;t patent your inventions, especially in a competitive industry like medical devices, others will simply copy those inventions with impunity and sell them at a lower cost because they didn&#x2019;t have to invest anything to develop them in the first place. That&#x2019;s a great way to drive the innovators out of any industry and halt any further technical advances in that field.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-551">Over the next 15 years or so, I continued to invent various new spinal surgery tools and techniques, eventually obtaining more than 950 patents worldwide for innovations that fundamentally changed the practice of spinal surgery. These innovations are today employed in the vast majority of spinal surgeries worldwide.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-190">In fact, they became so widely adopted and so central to modern spinal treatment that in 2005 the giant medical device company Medtronic purchased the majority of my patent portfolio of spinal surgery inventions for $1.35 billion. Having retired from medical practice, I now devote my energy and philanthropy to inventing new solutions to problems beyond orthopedics.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-493">The Michelson Medical Research Foundation, launched with a $100 million grant, is dedicated to funding cutting-edge medical research that would be considered to avant-garde to receive funding from the National Institutes of Health or other conventional funding sources. In just one area of medical research, we committed to funding the prestigious Sabin Vaccine Institute with an initial $5 million five-year grant to develop effective vaccines against the parasitic worms that infect 1.4 billion of the world&#x2019;s poorest people with devastating effect. </p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-222">The Michelson Found Animals Foundation promotes pet adoption and offers $50 million in research grants as well as a $25 million prize to any scientists who discover a way to chemically spay and neuter animals via a single, low-cost injection. Found Animals Foundation is one of the largest privately funded animal welfare foundations in the world and focuses on helping to end shelter euthanization and to improve the lives of pets and their people.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-735">My wife Alya and I also donated $50 million to the University of Southern California for the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience, to pursue medical breakthroughs in cancer and other diseases.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-350">The Michelson 20MM Foundation is dedicated to ensuring that equitable postsecondary educational opportunities that lead to meaningful careers are accessible to all, in part by making textbooks and new forms of interactive educational content available for free online to college students. At the cutting edge of higher education, the foundation helps forward-thinking entrepreneurs, nonprofits, and organizations close the opportunity gap. The Michelson Institute for Intellectual Property, a flagship Michelson 20MM initiative, provides access to intellectual property (IP) education to support budding inventors and entrepreneurs and close the existing &#x201C;IP education gap.&#x201D;</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-601">Which brings me to the important book you are now reading. <em data-effect="italics">The Intangible Advantage: Understanding Intellectual Property in the New Economy</em> is the first-ever text on intellectual property (IP) aimed at ordinary citizens, especially college students. As such, it is an important innovation in and of itself&#x2014;one that hopefully will solve a big problem in American education. I&#x2019;m particularly proud to have this newly released version of the textbook adapted for OpenStax, an initiative that has been at the cutting edge of innovation in higher education since its founding in 2012, and is also one of the Michelson 20MM Foundation&#x2019;s inaugural grantees. As such, it is an important innovation in and of itself &#x2014; one that hopefully will solve a big problem in American education.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-729">Until now, intellectual property has been taught only in law schools or the occasional business school seminar. In today&#x2019;s knowledge economy, however, this is no longer sufficient. That&#x2019;s because over the last 40 years, intellectual property has grown from an arcane, narrowly-specialized legal field into a major force in American social and economic life. It comprises an astonishing 45 percent of total U.S. GDP today, and represents 80 percent of the market value of all publicly-traded companies in the U.S.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-160">Put simply, intellectual property is now the chief engine of wealth creation and economic growth in the world. And as such, it has become a subject of vital importance for all Americans, not just those in the legal profession.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-761">There's a scene in the 1967 movie<em data-effect="italics">&#x201C;The Graduate&#x201D;</em> when Mr. McGuire (Walter Brooke) offers career advice to a young Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman)? &#x201C;Plastics!&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a great future in plastics. Will you think about it?&#x201D;</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-848">Half a century later, intellectual property has become the new watchword for almost any career of the future. Look around and you&#x2019;ll see IP&#x2019;s imprint everywhere. The business pages are filled with headlines of corporate &#x201C;patent wars.&#x201D; Art journals debate whether the artist Richard Prince&#x2019;s appropriation of other people&#x2019;s work is infringement or fair use. Music critics discuss the implications of the $7 million copyright infringement verdict against Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams for allegedly borrowing certain musical themes from the work of soul singer Marvin Gaye. Indeed, from Silicon Valley startups to Fortune 500 board rooms, from MIT engineering labs to Wall Street trading desks, and from college business seminars to debates in Congress over global trade policy, intellectual property issues now lie at the heart of almost every arena of modern life today.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-598">And as a result, any young person today who does not understand at least the basics of intellectual property&#x2014;and its value and role in science, business, arts, and the professions&#x2014;will find themselves at a distinct disadvantage in the world of tomorrow.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-286">This book comes in several forms, suitable for different uses. The traditional ebook version of <em data-effect="italics">The Intangible Advantage</em> contains the full text&#x2014;including the hidden history of the U.S. patent system, the world&#x2019;s first democratized patent system&#x2014;as well as links to the first-ever <a href="https://www.openstax.org/l/IPBasics" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">series of popular animated videos</a> on the basics of intellectual property. These videos answer such common questions as <a href="https://www.openstax.org/l/CanIPatent" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">&#x201C;Can I Patent That?&#x201D;</a> and <a href="https://www.openstax.org/l/WhatIfInfringeTrademark" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">&#x201C;What If Someone Infringes Your Trademark?"</a></p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-492">Finally, <em data-effect="italics">The Intangible Advantage</em> has a companion online course, Intellectual Property: Inventors, Entrepreneurs, Creators, available for free on Udemy. The online course is for self-directed learners &#x2014; whether college students in an IP fundamentals course, users of the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the U.S. Copyright Office, or young executive trainees working in corporate law and engineering departments in firms both large and small.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-783">Such a ground-breaking body of work would not have been possible without the extraordinary contributions of some of the leading lights in the intellectual property world over the past four years.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-342">Principal author, the late David Kline, did a masterful job of translating the hidden history, complex legal doctrines, and practical workings of the U.S. intellectual property system into popular and engaging prose. It probably helped that he is <em data-effect="italics"><u data-effect="underline">not</u></em> a lawyer by background, but rather a former war correspondent-turned-business journalist who wrote <em data-effect="italics">&#x201C;Rembrandts in the Attic,&#x201D;</em> the seminal work on patent strategy in corporate America published by Harvard Business Press. In addition to his deep curiosity about the role of IP in the new economy, David was passionate about illuminating even the most complex subject matter for the benefit of today&#x2019;s students. His impact on this text, and our entire Michelson Institute for Intellectual Property initiative, is beyond measure.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-88">Contributing author Robert G. Krupka is one of the foremost patent litigators in the nation. Anyone who wants to understand the complex (and controversial) American system of patent litigation can do no better than read his chapter on &#x201C;Patent Enforcement.&#x201D;</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-389">Contributing authors Randall E. Kahnke&#x2019;s and Kerry L. Bundy&#x2019;s expert rendition of the role and importance of trade secret law in the American economy will be much appreciated by students as well as business leaders in every industry. This is especially the case now that Congress enacted the first federal trade secret act.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-637">To be sure, a book that explains the complex workings of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret law in popular, non-legalese prose&#x2014;especially one largely written by a non-lawyer (albeit a recognized expert in the field)&#x2014;needs careful vetting. And for our &#x201C;peer-reviews&#x201D; we relied on the advice and counsel of a number of leading IP academics and practitioners, five of whom stand out most strongly for their contributions.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-586">Chief Judge (ret.) Paul R. Michel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the nation&#x2019;s main court for patent appeals, made enormous contributions in reviewing the manuscript not only for its legal theories but for its
  explanations of practical aspects of the patent system as well. His carefully-reasoned insider&#x2019;s explanation of how the patent system <em data-effect="italics">really</em> works made all of us who worked on this project feel privileged to sit at the feet of such a patient master.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-223">Professor Richard Epstein is the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law at New York University, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and professor emeritus and senior lecturer at the University of Chicago. Considered one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times, Professor Epstein&#x2019;s detailed review of the manuscript proved vital to this project.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-581">Professor Paul M. Janicke teaches in the Intellectual Property and Information Law Program at the University of Houston Law Center. His critique and guidance early on in the development of the manuscript was invaluable.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-272">Inventor and entrepreneur Louis Foreman is the founder and CEO of <em data-effect="italics">Edison Nation</em>, an invention commercialization organization, and creator and executive producer of the Emmy Award-winning PBS TV show, <em data-effect="italics">Everyday Edisons</em>. His insights into the commercialization challenges faced by independent inventors were extremely helpful.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-2788">Finally, former U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce and Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office David Kappos served as executive editor of the book. Especially for a subject like intellectual property that is so sharply defined by subtle nuances of law and practice, his unique expertise at the very center of the IP system helped to sculpt the manuscript&#x2019;s final shape.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-242">I would be remiss if I did not mention the tireless leadership of Michelson 20MM executive producer Phil Kim, who was both midwife and guiding hand of this project from its inception four years ago until its final realization in April of 2016. He reminds us all just how valuable clear vision and calm steadiness in the face of trials really are in an effort such as this.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-212">Similar praise and gratitude must be offered to Mayra Lombera and Marisa Moosekian, the Michelson 20MM producers who somehow managed to make all the myriad moving parts (and people) in this project fit together successfully. Whatever personality or production challenges arose, they somehow&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t really know how&#x2014;made this whole thing work.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-265">America's Founders created the world&#x2019;s first democratized intellectual property system for the common man. Now, the brightest minds in intellectual property have collaborated to democratize this once-inscrutable subject and bring you the world&#x2019;s first intellectual property textbook, online course, and videos series for readers and learners like you.</p>
        <p id="auto_c75f94c3-9e6a-45ae-88d3-f903f6e46795_eip-307">I hope you will find it enlightening&#x2014;and useful.</p>

In Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of the Constitution, Congress was given the authority to &#x201C;promote the progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries&#x201D;.<a href="#auto_18a49d1b-f775-445b-ad0d-122c458d11a0_footnote2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">ii</a></p>

And the Founders did this quite deliberately, says B. Zorina Khan, an economic historian at Bowdoin College whose book, <em data-effect="italics">The Democratization of Invention: Patents and Copyrights in American Economic Development</em>, was awarded the Alice Hanson Jones Prize for an outstanding work in economic history.<a href="#auto_18a49d1b-f775-445b-ad0d-122c458d11a0_footnote3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">iii</a> &#x201C;To the men who gathered in Philadelphia to &#x2018;promote the general welfare,&#x2019;&#x201D; Khan wrote, &#x201C;it was self-evident that ideas, industrial and cultural inventions, and democratic values were integrally related. American democratic institutions would ensure that rewards accrued to the deserving based on [merit] rather than on the arbitrary basis of class, patronage, or privilege.&#x201D;</p>
          <aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_18a49d1b-f775-445b-ad0d-122c458d11a0_footnote3"><div data-type="footnote-number">iii</div>B.

          <p id="auto_18a49d1b-f775-445b-ad0d-122c458d11a0_eip-678">Indeed, the Founders viewed intellectual property rights as vital to the new nation&#x2019;s economic survival. As George Washington himself stated in his first annual address to Congress in 1790, &#x201C;The advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures by all proper means will not, I trust, need recommendation. But I cannot forbear intimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement to the introduction of new and useful inventions.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_18a49d1b-f775-445b-ad0d-122c458d11a0_eip-470">The question is, with all the challenges they faced, why did the Founders think it so crucial to create a strong intellectual property system? Their reasons were both universal&#x2014;i.e., applying to all societies&#x2014;and also very particular to America&#x2019;s revolutionary experience.</p>

The U.S. Constitution thus offers inventors a bargain: If you invent something useful&#x2014;e.g., a cotton gin in 1794 that boosted agricultural production a hundredfold, or a semiconductor 163 years later that sparked the creation of a trillion-dollar new industry and millions of jobs&#x2014;then the Constitution and statutes say that, as a quid pro quo, you can have the exclusive right to that invention for a &#x201C;limited time,&#x201D; after which it goes into the public domain and belongs to society.</p>

This is what Daniel Webster was referring to when he said, &#x201C;The American Constitution does not attempt to give an inventor a right to their invention, or an author a right to his composition; it recognizes an original, pre-existing, inherent right of property in such invention or composition.&#x201D;</p>
            <p id="auto_18a49d1b-f775-445b-ad0d-122c458d11a0_eip-242">This right is not absolute, of course, and inventors&#x2019; inherent rights may at times be circumscribed by national security or other concerns. But in exchange for disclosing to the public the nature and details of the invention, the Constitution authorizes the government to enforce the inventor&#x2019;s exclusive property right to that invention for a limited time.</p>

The inherent property rights of inventors and authors to their creations are protected, thereby helping to ensure that the wellsprings of creation and productivity do not dry up for lack of incentive. And yet the benefits derived from these inventions and creations are ultimately harnessed to the public good through disclosure, thus promoting the progress of the nation and &#x201C;the general welfare&#x201D; of its citizens.</p>

          <p id="auto_18a49d1b-f775-445b-ad0d-122c458d11a0_eip-8631">To help understand why patent rights not only encourage inventors but also promote the wider diffusion of new technology for the benefit of society, economic historians Naomi Lamoreaux and the late Kenneth Sokoloff suggested the following thought experiment:</p>
          <p id="auto_18a49d1b-f775-445b-ad0d-122c458d11a0_eip-8632" class="has-noteref"> Imagine a world in which there was no patent system to guarantee inventors property rights to their discoveries. In such a world, inventors would have every incentive to be secretive and to guard jealously their discoveries from competitors [because those discoveries] could, of course, be copied with impunity. &#x201C;By contrast, in a world where property rights in invention were protected, the situation would be very different. Inventors would now feel free to promote their discoveries as widely as possible so as to maximize returns either from commercializing their ideas themselves or from [licensing] rights to the idea to others. The protections offered by the patent system would thus be an important stimulus to the exchange of technological information in and of themselves. Moreover, it is likely that the cross -fertilization that resulted from these information flows would be a potent stimulus to technological change. <a href="#auto_18a49d1b-f775-445b-ad0d-122c458d11a0_footnote4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">iv</a></p>

They did this by studying patent descriptions published by both the USPTO as well as by industry publications such as Scientific American, which was founded in 1845 by Munn and Company, the leading patent agency of the nineteenth century, expressly to spread new technological knowledge and facilitate the buying and selling of patents. For example, Elias E. Reis&#x2014;inventor of a number of devices to exploit the heat generated by electrical currents&#x2014;reported that when he read in the Official Gazette in 1886 about a patent issued to Elihu Thomson for a new method of electric welding, &#x201C;there immediately opened up to my mind a field of new applications to which I saw I could apply my system of producing heat in large quantities.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_18a49d1b-f775-445b-ad0d-122c458d11a0_footnote6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">vi</a> In many industries, specialized journals kept readers informed about new patents of interest.</p>

To understand why it did&#x2014;and how it helped build the most successful economy in the history of the world&#x2014;we must examine the revolutionary design of the U.S. patent system itself and the ways in which it overcame the weaknesses of earlier patent systems.</p>

      Sybaris (located in what is now southern Italy) in 500 BC, &#x201C;encouragement was held out to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury, the profits arising from which were secured to the inventor by patent for the space of a year.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_footnote8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">viii</a></p>

          <p id="auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_eip-935">The first formal patent legal institutions were developed in the Republic of Venice in the mid-1400s. The Venetian Statute of 1474 decreed that the inventors of new and useful devices would be protected from infringers and copiers
      for ten years so long as they disclosed the details of their inventions. Most Venetian patents were granted in the field of glass making, and when a large number of these glass makers emigrated to other countries in Europe, they sought similar
      protections from the local authorities. This is how the notion of patent rights, and their expression in patent legal systems, began to spread and gain acceptance throughout Europe.</p>
          <p id="auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_eip-171">Initially, however, English and French monarchs used patents not simply to stimulate invention, but also to grant exclusive trade monopolies to those favored by the court. In the reign of Elizabeth I in the latter 1500s, some 50
      patent monopolies were granted over the trade in such staples as salt, soap, starch, iron, and paper. Critics said these &#x201C;enriched the monopolist and robbed the community&#x201D; while doing absolutely nothing to stimulate new technology or industry.</p>
          <p id="auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_eip-802">A growing public outcry ultimately forced Elizabeth&#x2019;s successor James I to revoke these grants of trade monopolies in 1610. In 1624, the Statute of Monopolies formally repealed the practice and henceforth restricted patent rights
      solely to new inventions.</p>

          <p id="auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_eip-539">European countries made several other important innovations in their early patent systems. In the mid-1500s, France became the first to publish patent descriptions from inventors who chose to submit them. England under the reign of
      Queen Anne (1702&#x2013;1714) was the first to require inventors to submit a written description of their patent to &#x201C;describe and ascertain the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.&#x201D; And in 1729, France began to publish
      abbreviated digests of patent descriptions, but these were intermittent and subject to delays of up to 60 years after the patents were originally granted. As might be expected, this lack of regularity limited the technological knowledge sharing that
      is one of the great benefits of a patent system.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Flaws of Early Patent Systems</h3>
          <p id="auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_eip-271">Old World patent systems suffered from other major weaknesses as well. Patents for inventions imported from other countries were regularly granted, increasing the incentive for would-be patentees to copy
      the creative work of others rather than invent for themselves. And there was generally no systematic examination of patents by technical experts, in part because this was viewed as an intrusion upon the prerogatives of the Crown.</p>
          <p id="auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_eip-981" class="has-noteref">But the biggest problem with early patent systems was that they all shared a tendency to reinforce the wealth and prerogatives of elites, not the welfare and productive capacity of the whole of society. In Britain, patents were
      favors granted &#x201C;by grace of the Crown&#x201D; and were often only secured through court connections. They were also &#x201C;subject to any restrictions the government cared to impose, including the expropriation of the patent without compensation.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_footnote9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">ix</a>

Yet ironically, in the
      parliamentary debates over the patent system, the exclusion of the &#x201C;working classes&#x201D; was regarded as one of the chief virtues of the British patent system.</p>
          <p id="auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_eip-38" class="has-noteref">British patent law also severely limited the ability of inventors to sell or license the rights to their discoveries, as noted in a contemporary 1832 book entitled
      <em data-effect="italics">A Practical Treatise on the Law of Patents for Inventions</em>.

      This restriction, along with &#x201C;working requirements&#x201D;&#x2014;these were regulations that forced patentees to manufacture products based on their patents within two or three years of issuance or lose their patent rights&#x2014;limited innovation activity mainly to
      those who had the factories (or the ready capital to build them) needed to produce such products.</p>

          <p id="auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_eip-507">These rules had two significant effects upon the British economy. They restricted innovation to only a small sector of the population rather than unleashing the creativity and productivity of the whole people. And they created a
      bias toward inventions that enhanced the market dominance of incumbent, capital-intensive industries rather than opening up new markets for the sorts of disruptive new industries that usually drive economic progress.

          <p id="auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_eip-761">&#x201C;European societies were organized in ways that concentrated power in the hands of elites and facilitated [parasitic] rent-seeking by favored producers,&#x201D; notes historian B. Zorina Khan. &#x201C;The organization of invention was no
      exception. A society that restricts [invention] to elites can generate exceptional gains early on, but the initial spurt is unlikely to be maintained.&#x201D;

          <p id="auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_eip-486">Indeed, the result in Britain was unbalanced and narrowly focused economic growth. Inventors faced high transaction and monetary costs, a limited market for their inventions, and a great deal of uncertainty. Diffusion of new
      technological knowledge was severely inhibited, and the rate of technological change was adversely affected as a result. Eventually, Britain&#x2019;s initial leadership of the Industrial Revolution had more to do with its large existing commercial holdings
      and manufacturing base, and its vast stores of amassed capital, than with systemic or broad-based encouragement of innovation within British society.</p>

          <p id="auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_eip-822">The elitist nature of early patent systems reflected the feudal economic relations that dominated that era. But by the late eighteenth century, capitalist economies were beginning to emerge across Europe, and in
      Britain, nationwide lobbies of manufacturers and patentees called for an overhaul of the patent system to bring it in line with this new economy. The needed reinvention would come not from Britain, however, nor even from France, which had its own
      democratic revolution soon after America&#x2019;s. Instead, it took place in the newly liberated United States, where a vibrant capitalism unburdened by centuries of entrenched feudalism was developing.</p>
          <p id="auto_c3ed7b3d-6a69-4d9a-a75b-07a917572745_eip-932">This, then, is the story of one of the most admired of all American inventions&#x2014;the modern democratized patent system, now used widely throughout the world.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Incentives Needed to Spur Economic Growth</h3>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-346">As Jefferson wrote to his daughter Martha in 1787, it was precisely because America was bereft of Europe&#x2019;s vast resources and left to its own devices that &#x201C;we are obliged to invent and execute;
      to find means within ourselves, and not to lean on others.&#x201D;
    </p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-624">But how to do that? From the historical record, it appears that the Founders quite consciously sought to construct a patent system that would do what no other patent system in the world had ever done before&#x2014;namely, stimulate the
      inventive genius and entrepreneurial energy of the common man.
    </p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-355">As noted earlier, the first thing they did was to affirm inventors&#x2019; and authors&#x2019; rights in the U.S.Constitution itself. Although the intellectual property clause was ultimately adopted by unanimous consent of the delegates on September 5, 1787, there had been some debate about the issue. Thomas Jefferson in particular had expressed reservations about the wisdom of granting &#x201C;temporary monopolies&#x201D; (i.e., patent rights), given that Americans had just waged a bloody war of independence to overthrow the British monopoly of trade and political power. But as other delegates noted, and Jefferson eventually came to realize, a monopoly of trade is a far cry from the temporary incentives granted to inventors in return for the benefits they provide society.

Holloway, a Commissioner of Patents, would later argue in his 1863 annual report to Congress. &#x201C;How can the exclusive privilege to sell salt in
      Elizabeth&#x2019;s time, which added not one bushel to the production, but which enriched the monopolist and robbed the community, and the exclusive right of Whitney to his cotton gin, which has added hundreds of millions [of dollars] to the products and
      exports of the country, be both branded, with equal justice, with the odious name of monopoly?&#x201D;<a href="#auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_footnote14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xiv</a>

          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-693">The real genius of the Founders, however, lay in the way they consciously integrated democratic principles into the design of the world&#x2019;s first modern patent system&#x2014;principles that had a profound
      impact on the pace and direction of U.S. economic growth. These were reflected in six fundamental innovations in our patent system that departed from European practice.

          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-324">The original patent law passed by Congress on April 10, 1790, deliberately set patent fees to a level any ordinary citizen could afford&#x2014;initially $3.70, but three years later raised to $30. This was
      still less than 5 percent of the rate in Britain. Patent fees remained $30 for the next 70 years, ensuring that virtually any citizen could participate in the Industrial Revolution.</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-187">The results were dramatic. Whereas most of Britain&#x2019;s handful of inventors came from privilege, the vast majority of America&#x2019;s thousands of inventors came from humble beginnings. They included farmers, factory workers, merchants,
      mechanics, and other artisans.</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-146">Of the 160 so-called &#x201C;great inventors&#x201D; of nineteenth-century America, over 70 percent had only a primary or secondary school education. Many had no formal schooling at all. And some of the most famous names in American
      invention&#x2014;Matthias Baldwin (locomotive), George Eastman (roll film), Elias Howe (sewing machine), and Thomas Edison (electric light and phonograph)&#x2014;had to leave school early to support their families.</p>

They had only the general knowledge common to citizens of the day, plus whatever they taught themselves.
      What distinguished them was their ingenuity in applying that general knowledge to the practical problems of daily existence, and then exploiting the commercial opportunities that arose as a result. In short, they were entrepreneurial.</p>

      note Sokoloff and Khan. &#x201C;Rather than being accounted for by an elite who possessed rare technical knowledge or commanded large amounts of financial resources, the rise in patenting coincided with a broadening of the ranks of patentees to encompass
      many individuals, occupations, and geographic districts.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_footnote16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xvi</a>

          <h3 data-type="title">Simplifying Application Procedures</h3>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-435">The Founders greatly simplified administrative procedures in applying for a patent. This was no small thing when you consider that British applicants were forced to seek approval from seven different
      offices, and then twice&#x2014;twice!&#x2014;obtain the signature of the King. If they wanted a patent that covered Scotland and Ireland as well, they needed approval from ten more offices. British patent procedures were so Byzantine, in fact, that author Charles
      Dickens wrote a spoof of them entitled
      <em data-effect="italics">A Poor Man&#x2019;s Tale of a Patent</em>, in which his main character, an inventor, is forced to seek approvals from 34 offices, some of which had been abolished years before and no longer existed. Obviously, few inventors could hope to run
      this gauntlet successfully unless they had the wherewithal to hire very expensive patent agents to assist them.</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-182">In the United States, on the other hand, applications only needed the approval of a single patent office, which created repositories throughout the country where inventors could drop off their applications and models and have them
      forwarded to the patent office at government expense. Rural inventors could even apply for a patent through the mail&#x2014;postage free!</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-341">This last perk for rural inventors turned out to have a big impact on the course of U.S. economic development. While most British industrial breakthroughs were confined to London or other big cities, U.S. inventions were widely
      distributed across the country, in urban and rural areas both. The result was broader- based economic growth and less income inequality in the United States.</p>

          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-115">Another unique feature of the U.S. patent system was its systematic effort to spread new technological knowledge throughout society, thereby creating a virtuous circle of innovation begetting more
      innovation. In Britain, patents were only open to public inspection after paying a fee, and until 1852 were not even officially printed, published, or indexed. In France, printed information about patents was limited to brief titles in patent
      indexes, intermittently published and only available in the office in which these had been originally filed.</p>

The examinations were initially conducted by a committee composed of the Secretary of State (Thomas Jefferson), Secretary of War (Henry Knox), and Attorney General (Edmund Randolph). But this was found to be cumbersome, so in 1793 a simple registration system was established. It turned out, however, that without the examination of applications for novelty, non-obviousness, and utility, the validity of issued patents began to be questioned. So the reforms of the <a href="https://www.openstax.org/l/1836PatentAct" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1836 Patent Act</a> specified that henceforth applications would be scrutinized by technically trained examiners to ensure that the invention represented a genuine advance in the state of the art.

          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-148">For the first time anywhere in the world, the criteria for granting a patent depended solely upon the merits of the application rather than the identity or the mere say-so of the inventor.</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-982">The situation was very different in Europe. In France, the following caveat was printed on each patent: &#x201C;The government, in granting a patent without prior examination, does not in any manner guarantee either the priority, merit or success of an invention.&#x201D; Imagine trying to interest a group of investors in your new invention with that kind of warning label attached to it!</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-455">In Britain, meanwhile, the lack of any examination of patent validity made the purchase of a patent right highly speculative and costly, thereby limiting investment in new technology.</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-924">By contrast, says Khan, &#x201C;the U.S. examination system reduced uncertainty about the validity of patents, and provided [interested parties] with a signal of [their] potential value.&#x201D; This proved to be crucial in facilitating the growth of an extensive market in the sale and licensing of valuable patent rights&#x2014;the first large-scale market of this type in the world.</p>

Each
      U.S. patentee was also far more prolific than their British counterpart, so by mid-century, the United States was patenting five times the number of inventions as Britain each year, even though the populations were then equal in size.</p>

Because doing so enabled ordinary worker or farmer inventors without the capital to commercialize their own discoveries to still participate in inventive activity and earn income by
      licensing or selling their patents to enterprises that could. This ability to license patent rights (along with the low application fees) turned inventing into a new career path for thousands of poor but technically creative citizens.<a href="#auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_footnote21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xxi</a>

          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-138">Patent licensing, in fact, was the principal means by which new discoveries were commercialized in the decades before the early twentieth- century emergence of in-house corporate R&amp;D departments. Publications such as
      <em data-effect="italics">Scientific American</em>
      were founded specifically to facilitate the trade in patents, and it regularly featured lists of new and interesting patents, which commercial enterprises then licensed or purchased to use in their product development efforts.</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-62">American Bell Telephone&#x2019;s new product pipeline, for example, operated like most others at the time. According to its 1894 annual report, the company&#x2019;s R&amp;D department licensed 73 patents from outside inventors, while developing
      only 12 from its own employees.</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-510">Thomas Blanchard was a typical inventor-licensor. He was the son of a small farmer who invented and patented a mechanical tack-maker in 1806 that could fabricate five hundred tacks per minute, each superior to tacks made by hand.
      He sold the rights to his machine for $5,000, quite a sum in those days. He then invented a lathe to produce uniform gun stocks, and the patent he received for it enabled him to attract investors for the production of those gun stocks for the local
      Boston market. Blanchard also leased his patent rights to gun producers nationwide, as well as to manufacturers of tool handles and wheel spokes. The income he generated from patent licensing enabled him to make inventing his full-time career. He
      went on to invent a wood-bending machine, an upriver steamboat, and a steam wagon that was used until the introduction of railroads in the United States, and received a total of 25 patents during his career.</p>

Indeed, patent records from the nineteenth century reveal that
      more than two-thirds of the &#x201C;great inventors&#x201D; of the Industrial Revolution, including Thomas Edison and Elias Howe, were NPEs who specialized in invention and licensed some or all of their patents to outside enterprises for development into new

          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-17">To be sure, there is new a species of NPE known as &#x201C;patent trolls&#x201D; who use low-quality patents to extort so-called &#x201C;license fees&#x201D; from small businesses unable to pay the cost of standing up to them
      in court. But their activities have nothing in common with real patent licensing.</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-125">Typically, these patent owners send form letters to hundreds, or in some cases thousands, of random small businesses, claiming with little or no evidence that they are &#x201C;infringing&#x201D; their patents. These letters then demand so-called
      &#x201C;licensing fees&#x201D; ranging from one to several thousands of dollars to avoid a patent infringement lawsuit that could cost those businesses far more to defend against in court&#x2014;even if the business owner is innocent of any infringement.</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-796">Beginning in mid-2013, a torrent of bad faith demand letters began targeting small businesses, sparking wide protest. The National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) and many other business groups and trade associations
      demanded action, and Washington responded in 2014 with several pieces of proposed reform legislation. By early 2015, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had acted against one sender of bad faith demand letters, and federal legislation to rein in such
      abuses seemed likely to pass.</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-42">At the state level, meanwhile, by early 2015, 15 states had enacted laws to curb abusive patent demand letters, and 11 others were actively considering similar bills. In addition, the attorneys general of several states have used
      consumer protection laws against making false claims to force these &#x201C;patent trolls&#x201D; to stop sending their extortionist demand letters.</p>
          <p id="auto_49103fa7-3360-458f-938a-f43876378d1b_eip-362">These abusive patent litigants should not be confused with legitimate NPEs, however, whose primary business is invention and technology licensing, not extorting so-called &#x201C;license fees&#x201D; from innocent businesses. Patent licensing
      facilitates the transfer and commercialization of technology into new products and services and promotes U.S. economic growth.</p>

      The enforcement and interpretation of patent laws by the courts in Europe also tended to be highly variable and dependent upon the whims of each individual judge.</p>

Famed Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story repeatedly declared that patent rights were
      &#x201C;sacred&#x201D; and were the just reward for inventive ingenuity. As he noted in
        <a href="https://openstax.org/l/Lowell_v_Lewis" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em data-effect="italics">Lowell v. Lewis</em></a>
      (1817), &#x201C;the proper duty of the court&#x201D; is to ensure that &#x201C;wrongdoers may not reap the fruits of the labor and genius of other men.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_eip-600">The relative uniformity and certainty of enforcement of patent rights by the courts also proved critical in encouraging capital to invest in commercializing those patent rights.</p>
          <p id="auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_eip-368">Contrasting the patent laws and policies of the United States and Britain, Supreme Court Justice Henry Baldwin went to some lengths in
        <a href="https://openstax.org/l/Whitney_v_Emmett" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em data-effect="italics">Whitney v. Emmett</em></a>
(1831) to show how English courts saw patents as a zero-sum trade-off between private rights and the public good. The explicit intention of U.S. patent law, however, was &#x201C;to benefit the inventor, in the belief that maximizing individual
      welfare leads to maximum social welfare.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_eip-284" class="has-noteref">Nonetheless, U.S. intellectual property laws did try to strike a balance between the needs of the many and the few. &#x201C;Patent laws ensured the security of private property rights in invention. However, it was also necessary to
      balance the just claims of inventors against the dangers of exclusive monopolies that might restrict the scope of current and future invention.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_footnote28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xxviii</a>

          <p id="auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_eip-279">Over the years, of course, that balance has moved back and forth between relatively stronger versus weaker enforcement of patent rights. With the rise of the robber barons in the late
      nineteenth century, government and the courts increasingly viewed patents through the prism of antitrust, in some cases even compelling large firms like IBM to license their patents to competitors. Then with the advent of the high-tech revolution in
      the 1980s, antitrust concerns faded and the courts began once again to view stronger patent rights as helpful in fostering innovation.</p>
          <p id="auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_eip-991">Interestingly, the U.S. legal system has always operated on the theory that the best way to achieve the proper balance between private rights and public interest was not through government decree, centralized management, or
      compulsory licensing but rather through the decentralized decision making and market interactions of inventors themselves. The court&#x2019;s role was to resolve the inevitable conflicts that arose, on a case by case basis.</p>
          <p id="auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_eip-515">Throughout all the twists and turns in patent enforcement over the centuries, however, the federal courts have remained unwavering on four key principles of U.S. patent law.

          <p id="auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_eip-979">Patent litigation, of course, has always been an integral feature of the U.S. patent system. The first patent case on record was that of Benjamin Folger, whose patent for the production of candles
      was invalidated by the district federal court for New York in 1792. This was merely the first of many hundreds (and eventually thousands) of cases in which patent litigation served the important function of settling either the validity or the
      disputed ownership of the rights to critical new technologies&#x2014;the litigation between telephone inventors Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray being perhaps the most famous case in point. By doing so, the courts provided greater certainty regarding
      the value of such rights to entrepreneurs and investors alike.</p>
          <p id="auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_eip-714">Today, some critics contend that an &#x201C;explosion of patent litigation&#x201D; unlike any in history is harming business and diverting resources better spent on innovation. No responsible observer would deny that the courts have seen an
      increase in patent infringement suits in recent years, just as they have seen a rise in personal injury claims and product liability suits. But that said, the evidence shows that the rate of patent litigation today is actually below historical norms.</p>
          <p id="auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_eip-416">According to
      <a href="https://www.USCourts.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">USCourts.gov</a>
      figures, the number of patent infringement suits filed in the United States increased 59 percent between 2001 and 2011&#x2014;from 2,520 cases in 2001 to 4,015 cases in 2011. Meanwhile, the number of patents granted in that same period increased by only 35
      percent, which supports the view that patent litigation has become more frequent over the last decade as the role and value of intellectual property has increased in the Knowledge Economy.</p>

      show an even sharper rise in the number of patent suits filed in 2012, to 5,189 cases. But analysts attribute most of this increase to the anti-joinder provisions of the Patent Act of 2011, which curtailed the practice of naming multiple defendants
      in a single infringement suit. According to Carla Rydholm of the patent analytics firm Lex Machina, &#x201C;Plaintiffs must [now] meet more stringent requirements to file a case against multiple defendants. So instead of Plaintiff X filing one case naming
      20 defendants, Plaintiff X might file 20 lawsuits (one per defendant) each with unique civil action numbers.&#x201D;</p>

          <p id="auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_eip-477">Interestingly, although the number of suits filed has increased in rough correlation to patent grants, the number that actually go to trial has remained fairly constant over the last 30 years. About 90 percent of the suits filed
      each year are abandoned or settled. Of the three hundred that remain, two-thirds never go to trial, and are adjudicated on summary judgment (of noninfringement in most cases).</p>

          <p id="auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_eip-254">To be sure, there can be significant costs to business even in litigating and settling patent suits that never go to trial. But no one has shown that the relative cost of patent litigation today is higher than it was historically,
      or that the cost of patent litigation is more burdensome than other customary legal costs in business, especially the huge cost of regulatory compliance.</p>
          <p id="auto_fa221568-7f8e-4eb1-9ce0-64497a4c4562_eip-212">The evidence does not suggest that patent litigation is &#x201C;out of control&#x201D; today. As retired Chief Judge Paul Michel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the main court for patent appeals since 1982, notes, &#x201C;The
      level of patent litigation today is rather modest for a nation with two million active patents and hundreds of thousands of businesses competing against each other.&#x201D;</p>

      patentability of software and increasing the ability of the courts to impose sanctions on abusive litigants, which will be discussed later in this chapter. Also driving this decline in litigation was the availability of new post-grant review
      proceedings under the new America Invents Act, which allow third parties to challenge patents and, if the evidence so warrants, have their claims invalidated by the USPTO&#x2019;s Patent Trial and Appeal Board.</p>

          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-692">In 1630, the puritan John Winthrop, future governor of Massachusetts colony, declared that &#x201C;We shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-535">One hundred and fifty years later, the Founders of the United States of America proved Winthrop right, offering the world a vision of liberty and democratic governance that continues to inspire people to this day. As noted
      previously, the men who led the Revolution and wrote the Constitution were not wild-eyed revolutionaries. They were eminently practical people who managed to create the longest- living modern democratic political and economic system on the planet.</p>
          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-10">In other words, they must have done something right. And one of those things was surely the patent system they created. Because almost from the moment of its inception, it began to spark innovation and economic growth on a scope and
      scale never before seen in the world.</p>
          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-474">Only two months after America&#x2019;s first patent law was signed in 1790, in fact, Thomas Jefferson himself noted that it had &#x201C;given a spring to invention beyond my conception.&#x201D; Within 13 years, America surpassed Britain&#x2014;until then,
      the unrivaled leader of the industrial revolution&#x2014;in the number of new inventions patented, even though Britain still had more than twice America&#x2019;s population. By 1870, as noted earlier, the United States was patenting more than five times the number
      of inventions as Britain, although their populations were by then roughly equal in size.</p>
          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-32">At first, most British observers were dismissive of American innovation efforts, declaring that the former colony would never be able to progress beyond the simple imitation of superior European technologies. But eventually Britain
      and other nations took note of the way the U.S. patent system seemed to be stimulating invention and economic growth at an unheard-of pace.</p>

          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-739" class="has-noteref">As historians Lamoreaux and Sokoloff noted, &#x201C;[Foreign] observers attributed much of the country&#x2019;s rapid technological progress to its distinctive patent system. Quite revolutionary in design at inception, the U.S. patent system
      came to be much admired for providing broad access to property rights in new technological knowledge and for facilitating trade in patented technologies. These features attracted the technologically creative, even those who lacked the capital to
      directly exploit [i.e., commercialize] their inventions . . . and also fostered a division of labor between the conduct of inventive activity and the application of technical discoveries to actual production. It is no coincidence that Britain and
      many other European countries [later] began to modify their patent institutions to make them more like those of the Americans.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_footnote39" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xxxix</a>

          <h3 data-type="title">Every Breakthrough Spurs Patenting Spikes</h3>
          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-588">The patent system&#x2019;s central role in fostering innovation can be seen in the patenting spikes that occur with every major industrial breakthrough. A major surge in patenting took place in the
      1880s, for example, when the number of new patents issued each year jumped 56 percent to about 20,000, compared with the 12,000 issued yearly during the previous decade. This patent boom corresponded with rapid advances in the emerging railroad,
      telegraph, telephone, and electric light and power industries that signaled the industrialization of the U.S. economy.</p>
          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-383">The next sharp surge in patent issuances began around 1902 and lasted until 1916 or so, when the number of patents granted doubled from 20,000 per year to around 40,000 per year. This was the period of the newborn automobile and
      aircraft industries&#x2019; most rapid early-stage growth. Patenting levels then remained relatively stable at about 40,000 per year until around 1960 or so, when the revolution in plastics and other synthetic materials along with boom-time growth in the
      aerospace and computer industries pushed patenting levels to 60,000 per year. There they remained until the mid- 1980s, when the personal computer and emerging high-tech industries of Silicon Valley began to power the whole of the U.S. economy and
      propel us toward the age of the Internet. Patenting levels then rose to around 80,000 to 100,000 yearly</p>
          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-428">With the rise of the Internet, social media, mobile telephony, and smartphones over the last two decades, the number of patent applications filed each year with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has surged fourfold. In
      2014, the USPTO received 578,802 applications, finding 300,678 of these applications worthy of receiving a patent. This is but the latest spike in innovation and patenting.

      dramatically. It is no surprise, therefore, that Silicon Valley, midwife of many of the new Knowledge Economy industries of the past 60 years, is home to less than 1 percent of the nation&#x2019;s population but earns 12 percent of its patents each year.
      The Valley is now the site of a new USPTO satellite office serving high-tech innovators there.<a href="#auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_footnote40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xl</a>

      This is important because although large companies contribute enormously to American innovation and industrial growth through their in-house research and development operations as well as via their partnerships with research universities, start-up
      companies play a particularly strong role in the creation of entirely new industries. Indeed, virtually every innovative new industry of the last 150 years&#x2014;From the telegraph, telephone, and electric power industries of the 1800s, to the auto,
      aircraft, materials, and aerospace industries of the twentieth century, to the semiconductor, personal computer, software, biotech and Internet e-commerce industries of the last 60 years&#x2014;was launched by an entrepreneurial start-up company.</p>

        &#x201C;By the early nineteenth century, technology and prosperity were assuming for Americans the same sublime and moral significance that the enlightenment had reserved for the classical state and the Newtonian universe. Eli Whitney, inventor of the
        cotton gin, and Robert Fulton, creator of the steamboat, became national heroes.&#x201D;</p>

          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-896">And for the first time in human history, a nation had come to see its greatness not in empire or military might or royal lineage, but in its capacity for technological progress.</p>
          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-135">There was nothing preordained about America&#x2019;s economic success, no special &#x201C;Yankee ingenuity&#x201D; gene in their hereditary stock.

          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-322">Rather, the secret of America&#x2019;s success was a uniquely democratic patent system that &#x201C;added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius&#x201D; in generations of ordinary citizens&#x2014;and in so doing, helped in a very real way to give birth to
      the American Dream itself.</p>
          <p id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-213">Ironically, few people today even know the origin of the term &#x201C;the American Dream.&#x201D; In fact, it was coined in 1931, by the historian James Truslow Adams in his book
      <em data-effect="italics">Epic of America</em>, and it is instructive to read what Adams meant by it:    </p>
          <blockquote id="auto_56ebff11-6331-4ebc-9387-fb959d9d5e6e_eip-id1169836777729">

        &#x201C;The American Dream, that has lured tens of millions of all nations to our shores in the past century, has not been a dream merely of material plenty, though that has doubtless counted heavily. It has been much more than that. It has been a dream of
        being able to grow to fullest development as a man and woman, unhampered by the barriers which had slowly been erected in the older civilizations, unrepressed by social orders which had developed for the benefit of classes rather than for the simple
        human being of any and every class.&#x201D;</p>

      late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century life.</p>

          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-657">
      All patented inventions fit into one of these four categories: machine, manufacture, process, or composition of matter. But not everything that fits in one of these four categories can be patented. And the most
      important reason why one thing is patentable and another is not lies in the difference between ideas and applications.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-496">You cannot patent an idea for a better mousetrap&#x2014;not unless it can be developed into a new, non-obvious, and useful machine, manufacture, process, or composition of matter that can actually accomplish the task. You may have a
      genius idea for faster-than-light travel, but that will not get you a patent unless you can outline how to develop a tangible process or device for actually doing so, in which case you can seek to patent it.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-806">Put another way, &#x201C;talk is cheap&#x201D; when it comes to securing a patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office offers no judgment as to the wisdom or desirability of any particular invention&#x2014;patent No. 2,882,858
      for a bird diaper is certainly proof of that. But it absolutely will insist that every invention include a tangible device or process for achieving its intended purpose before it deems the invention worthy of a patent.

          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-776">There are other discoveries that fall into the broad category of abstract ideas and are thus unpatentable. You cannot patent a mathematical formula. You cannot patent a law of nature, such as Einstein&#x2019;s E=MC<sup>2</sup>. And you cannot patent natural phenomena like electricity (discovered by William Gilbert in 1600) or the Higgs particle that gives all matter its mass (discovered by researchers at the Large Hadron Collider on July 4, 2012). These all exist independently of human intervention, whether we have discovered them or formulated their rules yet or not, and must be freely available to all of humanity for its understanding and betterment.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-631">To restate the distinction, you cannot patent electromagnetism but you can patent a telegraph that uses electromagnetism to communicate rapidly over great distances, as Samuel Morse did in 1840 with patent no. 1647. And although
      you cannot patent light waves, you can patent a fiber optic wire that employs light waves to communicate even more rapidly and over greater distances, as Corning Glass researchers did in 1970 with patent no. 3,711,262.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Mixed Verdicts on Software Patentability</h3>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-790">The federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court have tried to clarify the limits of patentability in the computer age. Three Supreme Court cases in particular&#x2014;often called the &#x201C;patent-eligibility
      trilogy&#x201D;&#x2014;reveal the evolution of its thinking about software patentability.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-922">In 1972, the Supreme Court held in
        <a href="https://openstax.org/l/Gottschalk_v_Benson" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em data-effect="italics">Gottschalk v. Benson</em></a>
      that an algorithm in a computer program&#x2014;in this case, a mathematical procedure executed electronically that was similar to long division with paper and pencil&#x2014;was in and of itself not patentable. Phenomena of nature, mental processes, and abstract
      intellectual concepts are the basic tools of scientific and technical research, the court noted, and therefore could not be patented lest it foreclose others from using the algorithm and thereby stifle rather than promote technological progress.
      Granting a patent in this case, the court said, would be analogous to having granted Samuel Morse a patent covering all possible uses of electromagnetism in communications, rather than for the specific method and apparatus he actually invented.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-92">The court made a point of saying, however, that its decision did not mean that computer software could not be patented&#x2014;only that software whose only useful characteristic was an abstract algorithm could not be patented.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-328">The Supreme Court further refined its thinking on software patentability in the 1978 case
        <a href="https://openstax.org/l/Parker_v_Flook" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em data-effect="italics">Parker v. Flook</em></a>.
      Unlike the attempt to patent all uses of an algorithm in the <em data-effect="italics">Benson</em> case, here the use of a software algorithm was limited to a specific application&#x2014;setting off an alarm during the catalytic chemical conversion of hydrocarbons. This was a specific
      and tangible use of an algorithm, but the Court still ruled the software unpatentable because it felt the application itself was not inventive.
    </p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-849">But once again, the Court left the door open: &#x201C;Even though a phenomenon of nature or mathematical formula may be well known, an inventive application ... may be patented.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-169">Three years later, the Supreme Court made its third attempt to define the patent-eligibility of software. In
        <a href="https://openstax.org/l/Diamond_v_Diehr" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em data-effect="italics">Diamond v. Diehr</em></a>, the Court ruled that although algorithms by themselves are not patentable, a software program that used algorithms to govern the molding of raw synthetic rubber into cured precision products was in fact patentable because it involved
      &#x201C;transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing.&#x201D;</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">The Software Picture Blurs Even More</h3>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-645">Taken together, the three rulings appeared for a time to arrive finally at a coherent definition of software patentability&#x2014;namely, that although algorithms by themselves are abstract concepts and
      therefore unpatentable, software programs may be patented if they employ algorithms to produce a tangible and inventive or transformative result. This view was further augmented by a 1998 U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision in
        <a href="https://openstax.org/l/StateStreet_v_Signature" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em data-effect="italics">State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group</em></a>, which extended software patentability to software-enabled methods of doing business so long as these produced a &#x201C;useful, concrete, and tangible result.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-933">But this definitional equilibrium was not to last. The &#x201C;useful, concrete, and tangible result&#x201D; test in
      <em data-effect="italics">State Street Bank</em>
      was rejected ten years later by the same court in
        <a href="https://openstax.org/l/InreBilski" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em data-effect="italics">In re Bilski</em></a>, which upheld the USPTO&#x2019;s denial of a patent for a method of hedging risk in commodities trading. The court instead offered a &#x201C;machine or transformation&#x201D; test, which allows a software program or business method to be patented only if it
      is implemented on a specific machine to achieve a special purpose that is novel, non-obvious, and useful; it transforms an article from one thing or state to another.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-729">But in its review of
        <a href="https://openstax.org/l/Bilski_v_Kappos" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em data-effect="italics">Bilski v.

In addition to the &#x201C;machine or transformation&#x201D; test, the court decreed (rather vaguely) that any future test
      should be &#x201C;grounded in the examples and concepts&#x201D; expressed in its original &#x201C;patent-eligibility trilogy&#x201D; of opinions. They thus reaffirmed that business methods may indeed be patentable.</p>

          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-569">While businesses and the courts were trying to figure out what the other tests for patentability might be, the Supreme Court provided further input with its March 2012 decision in
        <a href="https://openstax.org/l/Mayo_v_Prometheus" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em data-effect="italics">Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories</em></a>. Here, the court ruled that a process enabling physicians to correlate blood test results with medication levels to achieve the most appropriate dosages was ineligible for patent protection.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-871">But then in June of 2014, The Supreme Court issued what may prove to be its most consequential decision on the patentability of software in the 33 years since
      <em data-effect="italics">Diamond v. Diehr</em>.
      In
      <em data-effect="italics">Alice v. CLS Bank</em>,
      the Court ruled that taking some activity that people have been doing for centuries&#x2014;in this case, holding funds in escrow until a transaction is completed&#x2014;and then merely &#x201C;doing it through a computer&#x201D; did not turn this age-old activity into a
      patentable new invention.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-132">At first, many observers believed that the effects of the
      <em data-effect="italics">Alice v. CLS Bank</em>
      ruling would be very limited. Only the patent in the suit was invalidated, after all, not all software patents. What&#x2019;s more, the abstract reasoning of the court in its decision did not provide clarity on how the ruling may or may not apply to other
      kinds of software patents&#x2014;for example, the sort of software used in manufacturing that was ruled patentable in the 1981
      <em data-effect="italics">Diamond v. Diehr</em>
      case.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-873">But by October of 2014, a series of lower court decisions applying the new
      <em data-effect="italics">Alice v. CLS Bank</em>
      standard had invalidated 13 additional software patents. As technology policy journalist Timothy B. Lee noted, &#x201C;The courts are sending a pretty clear message: you can&#x2019;t take a commonplace human activity, do it with a computer, and call that a
      patentable invention.&#x201D;</p>

      be? &#x201C;This doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean that all software patents are in danger,&#x201D; Lee noted, because the patents involved &#x201C;were particularly vulnerable to challenge under the new

      <em data-effect="italics">Alice</em>
      ruling was having an impact not only on patent law, but also on the innovation process itself within corporate America.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-550">As John Cronin, a former top inventor at IBM and now the CEO of the innovation-on-demand firm ipCreate, observes: &#x201C;The highest-value products and services today&#x2014;the ones that increasingly drive margins in business&#x2014;involve cloud
      computing, Big Data, machine learning, connectivity, mobility and location-based services, and on-demand and anything-as-a-service software applications and business processes. But ironically, these high-value innovations are also the most difficult
      to patent nowadays as a result of the Supreme Court&#x2019;s
      <em data-effect="italics">Alice</em>
      decision.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-251">Cronin calls this the &#x201C;<em data-effect="italics">Alice</em>
      Paradox,&#x201D; and it has left many in-house patent groups struggling for a solution. One thing is clear: To be patentable nowadays, software has to take a genuinely-inventive step and either trigger an action, employ a device, or in some other way
      produce a tangible transformative result.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-533">In addition, smart companies are trying to address patentability issues involving software and business processes much earlier in the innovation cycle, before huge investments are made in R&amp;D that may turn out to be not patentable.

      Paradox&#x201D; will be critical for many companies because patenting clearly adds value to a new product or service. In a groundbreaking joint study from Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Duke University entitled &#x201C;R&amp;D and
      the Patent Premium,&#x201D; economists found that &#x201C;the patent premium for innovations that were patented is substantial. Firms earn on average a 50% premium over the no patenting case, ranging from 60% in the health-related industries to 40% in

          <h3 data-type="title">The Debate on Software Continues</h3>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-359">The debate over the dividing line between patentable versus unpatentable computer software-related inventions continues&#x2014;in corporate R&amp;D labs and in the courts.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-514">However, there are some who don&#x2019;t believe that software and business methods should be patented under any conditions. They argue first of all that software is different from other industries&#x2014;more iterative and more incremental,
      with each advance building upon thousands of previous advances. Therefore, their thinking goes, software should not be entitled to patents that ought to be more properly reserved for truly breakthrough or revolutionary inventions.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-35">There are two problems with this argument. First, as anyone in the semiconductor, chemical, or medical device industries can attest, innovation is no more iterative, incremental, or cumulative in software than is innovation in many
      other industries. Indeed, there are probably just as many or more patents for incremental semiconductor inventions that build modestly upon earlier work as there are patents for incremental software inventions that do the same.</p>

          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-547">As patent scholar and veteran practitioner Paul Janicke of the University of Houston put it, &#x201C;There really are no breakthrough inventions&#x2014;at least not in the sense imagined by these critics. Everything moves one step at a time. In
      fact, every time I thought I encountered a large leap, it turned out that I didn&#x2019;t know the full extent of the prior art.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-441">The second problem with their logic is that the Founding Fathers specifically designed the patent system to encourage precisely this kind of incremental invention, so that ordinary people&#x2014;using only the basic technical skills
      possessed by most citizens&#x2014;could participate in rapidly developing the economy from the ground up. This was a very different approach than that of elitist European patent systems of the day, and it produced results that the rest of the world very
      soon came to envy (see &#x201C;Section 1.5: What the U.S. Patent System Wrought&#x201D;).</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-958" class="has-noteref">As the October 21, 1876, issue of Scientific American noted, &#x201C;In the aggregate the little things&#x2014;which in England or the continent would not or could not be patented&#x2014;probably add more to the wealth and wellbeing of the community &#x2026;
      than the great things do.&#x201D; Or to quote Thomas Jefferson himself: &#x201C;A smaller [invention], applicable to our daily concerns, is infinitely more valuable than the greatest which can only be used for great objects.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_footnote46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xlvi</a>
      Any uncertainty over the validity of incremental patenting was removed once and for all by the Patent Act of 1952. Consistent with the Founders&#x2019; intentions, U.S. law now explicitly holds that patent eligibility is not restricted solely to
      revolutionary inventions or &#x201C;flash of genius&#x201D; discoveries, but also includes more iterative advances in the state of the technological art so long as these meet the requisite novelty, non-obviousness, and utility criteria.

      If anything, in fact, the software industry has become even more innovative, more diversified, and more start-up friendly since patenting became common in the 1990s. You need only look at the huge proliferation of highly innovative start-ups in
      today&#x2019;s social media and apps software fields to see just how erroneous the claim is that software patents stifle innovation. Or consider for a moment the fate of the Blackberry, once dominant but within the space of a couple of years superseded by
      more innovative competing smartphone makers.</p>

          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-851">Finally, some critics insist that the intangible nature of software ought to disqualify it from patentability. But as noted earlier, the Supreme Court has affirmed repeatedly that although abstract concepts cannot be patented,
      software that employs algorithms to produce a tangible and inventive result&#x2014;e.g., software that governs the molding of raw synthetic rubber into cured precision products&#x2014;may be patented.</p>

Forty years ago, 80 percent of the market value of all public companies resided in their tangible physical assets&#x2014;their plant, equipment, and raw materials. In today&#x2019;s
      Knowledge Economy, however, it is intangible assets&#x2014;intellectual property&#x2014;that make up 80 percent of the market value of public companies.<a href="#auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_footnote48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xlviii</a>

          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-300">Indeed, the entire history of economic progress on our planet may be described as one long climb by humanity up the ladder of abstraction&#x2014;from brute force to the subtle use of energy, from wealth derived from tangible resources and
      industrial machinery to wealth derived from ever-more ingenious ways to deploy that energy and those resources. It seems only logical, therefore, to expect that invention itself should follow a similar trajectory&#x2014;from the realm of the tangible to the
      realm of the intangible.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-663">Ironically, the debate over patents for software, business methods, and other intangible inventions is nowhere more heated than on the Internet, itself an intangible realm in which &#x201C;virtual&#x201D; businesses launched with little more
      than hope and electrons (e.g., Facebook) are creating real and substantial wealth in the form of new products, new services, new jobs, and new economic growth for society. Yet strangely, those who have no trouble accepting the Internet as the
      intangible fruit of information age invention seem to get stuck in industrial age conceptions of what should and should not be patentable.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-881">Odd perhaps, but not surprising. The expansion of patentable subject matter into new and more intangible realms has always met with resistance. Patents involving the use of electricity were condemned 140 years ago, as were
      biotechnology patents 30 years ago, and of course software patents when they began to appear in large numbers 20 years ago. In each case, critics warned that these new kinds of patents would hold back further scientific discovery and innovation. Yet
      in each case, innovation and discovery actually intensified and their benefits to society multiplied.

          <h3 data-type="title">When Gene-Related Inventions Are Patentable</h3>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-14">A similar resistance is also developing toward gene-related patents. These began to be issued in significant numbers after the Supreme Court&#x2019;s 1980 ruling in
      <em data-effect="italics">Diamond v. Chakrabarty</em>, which upheld the first patent on a newly-created living organism&#x2014;a bacterium for digesting crude oil in oil spills. Since then, patents have been granted for isolated gene sequences, but so far only on
      those with known functions and not on naturally- occurring genes in humans or other organisms. Patents have also been granted for gene sequences used in diagnostic testing, and on gene sequences that have been altered to make them more useful in a
      specific application.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-443">In March of 2010, however, a federal district court judge ruled in the case of
      <em data-effect="italics">Myriad Genetics</em>
      that even isolated DNA is fundamentally the same as naturally- occurring DNA and is therefore ineligible for patenting. His ruling was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in July, 2011. But the Supreme Court then set aside
      that decision and directed the appeals court to once again review the case in light of its March, 2012
      <em data-effect="italics">Prometheus</em>
      decision. On August 16, 2012, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit once again reaffirmed Myriad&#x2019;s right to patent the isolated genes BCRA1 and BCRA2, which are involved in most inherited forms of breast and ovarian cancer.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-705">On June 13, 2013, however, the U.S. Supreme Court finally determined in a unanimous decision that a naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and cannot be patented merely because it has been isolated, thereby
      invalidating Myriad&#x2019;s patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The Court did rule, however, that the manipulation of a gene to create something not found in nature&#x2014;such as a strand of synthetically-produced complementary DNA (cDNA)&#x2014;could still be
      eligible for patent protection.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-325">To the average citizen&#x2014;and perhaps to many patent lawyers as well&#x2014;all this legal hairsplitting over the limits of patentability in the computer age must seem a bit like the debates in medieval times over how many angels can dance
      on the head of a pin. But two critical points must be borne in mind regarding these debates.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-644">First, no matter what anyone thinks the limits of patentability in an ideal world ought to be, out in the real world where we actually live, software, business method, and gene patents are multi- billion-dollar facts of life that
      businesses ignore only at their peril.</p>
          <p id="auto_0c20d602-db53-446b-8c6a-78dcff596855_eip-529">Second, whatever confusion may exist today, the debates over patentability in the computer age will almost certainly be resolved eventually to most people&#x2019;s satisfaction, just as all previous debates over patentability have. For if
      nothing else, the two hundred year-plus history of the courts and the patent office demonstrate a remarkable ability on the part of these institutions to adapt to the challenges posed by new technologies and new economic conditions.</p>

Specifically, it must not have been patented, described in an unpublished or published
      patent application, explained in a printed publication such as an article or technical paper, or publicly known prior to the filing date of the new patent application. In addition, it must not have been published, used in public, or offered for sale by the applicant or their colleagues more than 12 months prior to the filing of a patent application.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Utility</h3>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-407">As the
      <em data-effect="italics">Star Trek</em>
      example suggests, the novelty issue can also touch on the question of utility&#x2014;the second patentability criteria. Utility has a special meaning in patent law, which is simply that an invention must function and be of some benefit
      qualitatively&#x2014;although no minimum quantum of benefit is necessary. The landscape of business is littered with companies that have invented not very useful or necessary products. But these may satisfy the requirement for utility if at least someone
      would find them useful.
    </p>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-183">But snake oil medicines and other products that do not work in any meaningful way will not meet the requirement for utility. &#x201C;The inventor of an ineffective drug may not obtain a patent merely because he convinces gullible patients
      that it has a non-existent curative effect,&#x201D; Miller and Davis note. &#x201C;It is not so much that it lacks a minimum quantum of benefit (the patients may find it subjectively useful), but it is, instead, that it has an impermissible fraudulent quality.&#x201D;</p>

Simply put, the thing or the method you have invented must actually work
      as it is intended and claimed to work.</p>

      for a moment,&#x201D; says Quinn. &#x201C;On a more mundane level, the USPTO used to deny patents for methods and compositions for re-growing hair. These were seen as lacking utility because re-growing hair was believed to be impossible. Finally, someone was able
      to prove that his method and composition actually re-grew hair on a bald scalp. The patent examiners withdrew their rejection, and patents for such products have issued ever since.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-752">Interestingly, Quinn explains, since the earlier patent applications on hair-growing products didn&#x2019;t describe anything that actually worked, they could not be used under the novelty bar to block later patent applications for
      hair-growing products that did work.</p>

          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-458">The requirement for non-obviousness may be illustrated with a fanciful example. If the number 4 were an invented product rather than a mathematical symbol, then even though the number 4 had never been invented before and
      was thus novel, it would still not be patentable. That&#x2019;s because someone skilled in the art could have put 2 and 2 together to come up with it.</p>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-799">But to offer a more practical example, say you invent a wheeled cart to move office supplies more easily between departments. If this is the first such wheeled office cart in history, you can get a patent for it. But if you then
      decide, &#x201C;Hey, why not put those wheels on a chair?&#x201D; you won&#x2019;t get a patent for it. That&#x2019;s because combining two such widely-known and available elements would be obvious to anyone skilled in the art of office furniture design.</p>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-918">But things are not so obvious when it comes to inventing a camera phone. Even though it&#x2019;s composed of well-known and widely-available components, combining the two did satisfy the requirement for non-obviousness because it became
      more than the sum of its parts and met a large and previously-unfilled need in the marketplace. The millions of people who take selfies everyday is certainly proof of that.</p>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-605">There are various ways of presenting evidence that your invention satisfies the non-obvious requirement for patentability. You can demonstrate that the existing elements of your invention, although individually already known, yield
      an unexpected or hidden result. Or you can show that your invention, although composed of well- known and widely available components, when combined satisfies a long-felt but previously unfilled need in the marketplace, thus indicating its
      non-obviousness. Both of these demonstrations of non-obviousness apply to the camera phone example above.</p>

          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-285">They contended that although Amazon might have been the first company to employ the process, it was an obvious and inevitable iteration of already- existing mouse-clicking procedures for making a purchase online. The patent office
      reexamined the patent, however, and in 2007 upheld the validity and the bulk of its major claims.</p>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-329">It is important to note that it&#x2019;s an invention&#x2019;s function that is often examined to determine obviousness. &#x201C;Even though it may be obvious that a certain object can be constructed in a certain way, its utility and novelty may lie in
      its functional use, not its construction,&#x201D; write Miller and Davis. &#x201C;Therefore, the prior art must be used to determine whether the invention&#x2019;s new and useful function, not its construction, is non-obvious.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-671">During the first half of the twentieth century, the courts often saw an invention as obvious when it lacked a &#x201C;flash of genius&#x201D; and was merely an incremental advance over the state of the art as opposed to what they imagined would
      be a &#x201C;revolutionary&#x201D; breakthrough discovery. But that subjective interpretation of inventiveness was overturned by the 1952 Patent Act, which codified a more objective standard&#x2014;namely, that whether an invention is developed through laborious trial
      and error or through a eureka flash-of-genius moment has no bearing on its obviousness or non-obviousness.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Overcoming Patent Hurdles</h3>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-465">Taken together, the three patenting criteria&#x2014;novelty, utility, and non-obviousness&#x2014;function like the obstacles in an Olympic hurdles race. The utility hurdle is easiest to overcome. The novelty hurdle less so.
      But by far, the highest hurdle facing inventors is non-obviousness.
    </p>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-343">&#x201C;The vast majority of all rejections at the patent office are for obviousness reasons,&#x201D; explains retired Chief Judge Paul Michel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the main court that handles patent appeals. &#x201C;And
      it&#x2019;s not very difficult to see why. Given the millions of patented inventions over the decades, the tens of millions of past and current products on the market, it&#x2019;s not all that easy to come up with an invention that is not only novel but also truly
      non-obvious to someone with ordinary skill in the state of the art.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-370">Many believe that the criteria for patenting weakened in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and that as a result, too many poor-quality patents were issued. To the extent this problem exists, one of its likeliest causes is the
      fivefold increase in patent applications that has taken place over the last 30 years without a commensurate increase in USPTO funding, resources, and capabilities.</p>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-757">Despite these challenges, the USPTO has made substantial progress in the last five years in improving examiner training and tools, reducing the backlog of pending applications, and strengthening the quality of the examination
      process for patent applications. This progress has been made despite oftentimes-unclear or contradictory patentability rulings from the courts.</p>
          <p id="auto_7f01c964-72fd-437a-96f9-a78ed89853dc_eip-314">Patent quality is essential to the maintenance of public confidence in the patent system. After all, when property rights (either real or intellectual) are seen as overbroad, ill-defined, or illegitimate, individuals and businesses
      are more willing to trespass on them.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Plant Patents</h3>
          <p id="auto_ae489e1a-affe-4e5b-a0b6-78f17e5ca90f_eip-604">Plant patents were first created by the
      <a href="https://www.openstax.org/l/PatentAct1930" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Patent Act of 1930</a>, which had been proposed by Luther Burbank to protect new species of asexually reproduced plants, mostly
        flowers. These are different than the utility patents granted to bioengineered plants used in agriculture. The United States was the first country in the world to grant plant patents, and even today many countries continue to deny protection for
        plants. Indeed, even some signatories to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) reserve the right to deny patents for plants.</p>
          <p id="auto_ae489e1a-affe-4e5b-a0b6-78f17e5ca90f_eip-950">Although the requirements for plant and design patents are substantially the same as those for utility patents, there are some crucial differences. The most important of these is the substitution of a different test for one of the
      three criteria for patentability discussed in the previous section.</p>
          <p id="auto_ae489e1a-affe-4e5b-a0b6-78f17e5ca90f_eip-499">Instead of novelty, utility, and non-obviousness, the criteria for plant patentability are novelty,
      <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_ae489e1a-affe-4e5b-a0b6-78f17e5ca90f_term14" group-by="d">distinctiveness</span>, and non-obviousness. To be patentable, plants must be cultivated rather than found in the wild, and plant patents are granted only to protect a new, distinct, and non-obvious variety of asexually reproduced
      plant&#x2014;i.e., those grown not with seeds but by grafting, budding, or cutting. A plant need not be useful to qualify for a patent, but it must be distinctive in its color, habit, soil, flavor, productivity, form, or other aspects.</p>

          <p id="auto_ae489e1a-affe-4e5b-a0b6-78f17e5ca90f_eip-912">Design patents are granted to protect new, original, and non-obvious ornamental designs for articles of manufacture. Examples include Apple&#x2019;s 2009 and 2010 patents&#x2014;<a href="https://www.openstax.org/l/USD593087" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. D593087</a>

      for the look and feel of the iPad. Design patents can be just as valuable as utility patents, as Apple discovered when a jury awarded it $1 billion in damages against Samsung in August 2012, for the latter&#x2019;s infringement of Apple&#x2019;s utility and design
      patents. The case is currently on appeal.</p>
          <p id="auto_ae489e1a-affe-4e5b-a0b6-78f17e5ca90f_eip-256">Like plant patents, design patents also substitute a different test than utility in their requirements for patentability. Instead of the novelty, utility, and non-obvious requirements for utility patents, the criteria for design patents are novelty,

          <p id="auto_ae489e1a-affe-4e5b-a0b6-78f17e5ca90f_eip-109">It was on the subject of design patents that one example of media confusion appeared. The
      <em data-effect="italics">New York Times</em>
      published an article November 16, 2012, declaring in a sensational headline that &#x201C;<a href="https://www.openstax.org/l/ApplePageTurn" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Now Owns the Page Turn</a>.&#x201D; The article claimed that a new Apple design patent &#x201C;gives Apple the exclusive rights to the page turn in an e-reader application.&#x201D; According to the article&#x2019;s author, this showed &#x201C;just how broken the patent system is.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_ae489e1a-affe-4e5b-a0b6-78f17e5ca90f_eip-108">Had the author of the article even read an obvious and easily-available source as the Wikipedia entry on design patents, however, he would have learned that design patents are granted only for nonfunctional ornamental designs. In
      fact, says Wikipedia, &#x201C;design patents can be invalidated if the design has practical utility.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_ae489e1a-affe-4e5b-a0b6-78f17e5ca90f_eip-121">What Apple actually &#x201C;owns,&#x201D; therefore, is not the &#x201C;page turn&#x201D; function itself but merely the particular ornamental design of the way a page turn is executed in their devices.</p>
          <p id="auto_ae489e1a-affe-4e5b-a0b6-78f17e5ca90f_eip-571">Another example of confused media reporting on patent matters was the February 6, 2013,
      <em data-effect="italics">Forbes</em>
      article headlined: &#x201C;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/#/62ee8b9728c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Is the Patent System Broken? Well, Amazon&#x2019;s Just Patented the Sale of Second Hand Goods</a>.&#x201D; Amazon actually did no such
        thing, but the author of that article probably made this assumption after reading the abstract of the patent describing its general subject matter. Like many reporters new to patent issues, the author didn&#x2019;t realize that the abstract tells you
        literally nothing about the exclusive rights conferred by a patent. Only the claims of the patent detail the specific exclusionary rights of the patent holder.
    </p>
          <p id="auto_ae489e1a-affe-4e5b-a0b6-78f17e5ca90f_eip-243">Indeed, when you read the claims of the Amazon patent in question, you discover that Amazon hasn&#x2019;t claimed ownership of the idea of a &#x201C;market in second-hand digital goods&#x201D; at all. Instead, the claims involve merely a very specific
      and novel method of conducting such a market. Meanwhile, Apple, ReDigi, and other firms have patented their own alternative methods of conducting a secondary digital market.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Applying for a Patent</h3>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-595">Much is at stake in the process of applying for a patent. Depending upon how you draft the claims and write the specification of your application, you could win or lose patent rights at any point in the examination
      process. In addition, any patent rights you win can be worth a considerable amount of money, and can be enforced by the U.S. federal courts.
    </p>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-233">An applicant must first determine whether to file an application for a utility, design, or plant patent. Then, the applicant must determine their filing status: large entity, small entity, or the new category of micro entity created by the
      <a href="https://www.openstax.org/l/AmericaInventsAct" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">America Invents Act of 2011 (AIA)</a>. Small entities, which are universities,
        non-profits, and small businesses with fewer than 500 employees who also meet certain other criteria, receive a 50 percent discount on the application fees paid by large entities. Micro entities, which are small entities who have a gross income less
        than three times U.S. median household income or meet certain other criteria, receive a 75 percent discount. These discounts on USPTO fees for small and micro entities do not apply to the attorneys&#x2019; fees often involved in applying for a patent, which
        can be significant.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Provisional vs. Nonprovisional Patent Application</h3>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-803">Finally, the applicant must decide whether to file an abbreviated, &#x201C;provisional&#x201D; patent application or a complete, &#x201C;nonprovisional&#x201D; one. A provisional application consists only of the
      specification describing the invention for which a patent is sought, as well as any drawings that might be necessary to understand the invention. A provisional application is not subject to examination, and is viable for one year.
    </p>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-594">The chief benefits of a provisional application are twofold. It is much less expensive to file than a regular nonprovisional application&#x2014;only $1,000 in official fees for large entities, $500 for small entities, and $250 for micro
      entities. It also gives the inventor the benefit of the earlier provisional filing date of the nonprovisional application based on the same specification, while measuring the term of the patent from the nonprovisional application&#x2019;s filing date.</p>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-987">In a sense, the provisional application serves as a placeholder for up to one year while the inventor does all the prior art searching, claims drafting, and other work required of a full and complete nonprovisional application.
      This priority date placeholder function can be important given that many companies and inventors are working on new products and services aimed at the same markets. This is especially so under the United States&#x2019; new &#x201C;first inventor to file&#x201D; rather
      than &#x201C;first to invent&#x201D; priority regime, which some fear may give an edge to large companies with the legal and financial resources to file early and often. To the extent this concern may be valid, provisional applications can serve to mitigate any
      large company filing advantage.</p>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-165">The main disadvantage of a provisional application is that because the written description cannot be changed when filing the follow-on, nonprovisional application, all the subsequent claims in that follow-on application must be
      completely consistent with the earlier description language. As most inventors can attest, the understanding of an invention and its potential market&#x2014;as well as the claims best suited to protect it&#x2014;inevitably evolves and matures over time.</p>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-365">Here&#x2019;s how an experienced entrepreneur describes the value of a provisional application in the &#x201C;first inventor to file&#x201D; environment:    </p>
          <blockquote id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-id4822300">
            <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-id48223002">
        &#x201C;What I recommend to every entrepreneur is that if you write a new, non-obvious, and useful line of code, put it in the specification of a provisional patent application and file it. It only costs $1,000 at most. You then have a year in which to
        honestly evaluate where the industry is going, where the market is going, and whether your invention is truly valuable enough to pursue a patent for it.&#x201D;</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-629">A year might not seem very long. But a lot can happen to markets and to technology in that amount of time. Thanks to the rapid rise of smartphones, for example, it took merely a year for netbooks to go from the &#x201C;next big thing&#x201D; to &#x201C;who cares?&#x201D;</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">The Critical Importance of the Claims</h3>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-959">When it comes to filing a full nonprovisional application, the most critical task of the inventor (and patent attorney) is to draft the claims. This is an art in and of itself, one that
      will determine the inventor&#x2019;s rights and an infringer&#x2019;s liability.</p>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-30">Each claim serves as a stand-alone definition of the patent coverage&#x2014;as a sort of mini-patent unto itself. After a patent is granted, a claim is the only thing that someone can be accused of infringing. Accordingly, broad claim
      language is essential if a commercially meaningful patent is to be obtained.</p>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-744">On the other hand, the broader the claim, the more likely it is that prior art may exist somewhere that anticipates the claim or renders it obvious and, therefore, invalidates the claim. So the competent draftsperson submits a
      dozen or more claims, typically moving from broader to narrower scope, in case the broader claims turn out to be disallowed by the USPTO or later invalidated by a court.</p>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-223">Some applicants make the opposite mistake and draft claims that are too narrow&#x2014;&#x201C;a programmable multifunction computer in the shape of a metal clamshell,&#x201D; for example. Such a claim is of little value because others can easily design
      around it simply by using plastic or other nonmetal materials in the design. Some claims are so narrow they are even referred to as &#x201C;picture claims&#x201D; because they paint a literal and limiting picture of the invention. You may get a patent with such
      picture claims, but it probably won&#x2019;t be worth the paper it&#x2019;s printed on.</p>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-937">The strongest claims usually define powerful functionality. They capture something fundamental or seminal in the functioning of the invention.</p>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-503">A good example is the claims in the aforementioned Amazon one-click patent. The algorithms for &#x201C;one-click&#x201D; shopping are not very complicated. Yet the claims capture a very profound functionality&#x2014;the idea that a user should not have
      to type in credit card and shipping information every time he or she wants to buy something. The consumer-friendly functionality captured in that patent&#x2019;s claims has won Amazon a lot of customers and made it a lot of money.</p>

          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-824">Once the patent application with all necessary forms is filed and all fees are paid, the

      will review the patent application to determine if the invention meets the statutory requirements for patentability. The examiner will also conduct a search of patent and other databases to determine if the invention appears to be truly novel and
      non-obvious. Once a determination has been made, the patent examiner will send the applicant a document known as a
      <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_term17" group-by="f">first office action</span>, in which the patent examiner approves, rejects, or requires additional information about the claims and/or other elements of the application.</p>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-783">If all the claims are allowed, which is rare in a first office action, the patent prosecution process is complete. A more common next step requires the applicant to respond to the patent examiner&#x2019;s rejections and requests for more
      information. In this response, the applicant will address all of the examiner&#x2019;s concerns and either rebut them or amend the application, typically by revising some or all of the claims.</p>
          <p id="auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_eip-119" class="has-noteref">But according to the Manual of Patenting Examination Procedure (MPEP) Section 1.121, &#x201C;No amendment may introduce new matter into the disclosure of an application.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_7cd416fd-ef7f-49cb-9a8f-d30449d0bad6_footnote51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">li</a>

The USPTO is responsible only for examining and issuing patents&#x2014;it does not enforce them. It is up to the owner of the patent to enforce it against infringers by filing a civil case in federal court for patent infringement.</p>

The Patent Act does not grant the patent owner the right to practice the invention covered by the patent. Indeed, it may be that the invention, if practiced in the United States, could infringe someone else&#x2019;s patent! For example, if you obtain a patent on an improvement to a patented product (e.g., a faster-acting version of a patented painkiller), you might not be able to sell the improved product unless you obtain a license under the patent for the underlying product.</p>

The first step is to decide whether someone is infringing your patent&#x2014;i.e., making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing your invention without your permission. To decide whether someone is infringing your patent, the elements of each claim of the patent must be compared with the elements of the potential infringer&#x2019;s device or process. If the elements of a patent claim match (or &#x201C;read on&#x201D;) the elements of the device or process, an infringement has occurred.</p>

If the accused device or process performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way and yields substantially the same result, infringement exists so long as any differences between the claim elements and the accused device are not substantial. A patent calling for an &#x201C;adhesive&#x201D; connection (describing glue as the preferred adhesive) could be infringed by a device using a hook-and-loop fastener(e.g.,Velcro). That&#x2019;s because the hook-and-loop fastener arguably performs substantially the same adhesive function in substantially the same way and with substantially the same result as the glue adhesive.</p>

Often, but not always, this is a different person at a different law firm than the lawyer or agent who previously assisted the inventor(s) in obtaining a patent from the USPTO. Once the patent trial lawyer is retained, that lawyer will evaluate the patent and the accused device or process, and will provide the patentee a legal opinion about whether or not an infringement exists. If an infringement is found, the patentee then must decide how to proceed. Several options exist.</p>

      return for a share of any damages (typically 30 to 40+ percent) that are collected from the infringer. As of 2014, a wide variety of litigation finance firms exist that may be willing to fund your litigation in return for a share of any damage award
      or settlement payment you receive.<a href="#auto_446df5a7-4e96-4d50-9ae6-4c7ca90ae5c8_footnote3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">iii</a>

Even if the infringer balks at an agreement unless you initiate a
      lawsuit, often the lawsuit can be settled via a license agreement short of trial. About 95 percent of patent lawsuits settle before trial, many with the defendant(s) taking a license for which they pay a royalty.<a href="#auto_446df5a7-4e96-4d50-9ae6-4c7ca90ae5c8_footnote4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">iv</a>

        <p id="auto_446df5a7-4e96-4d50-9ae6-4c7ca90ae5c8_eip-633">Even small entities and individuals can successfully license a patent without filing a lawsuit if they have a good patent and a reasonable licensing plan. Most prospective licensees know that lawsuits are very expensive and would
      prefer to settle a dispute with a license rather than fight a lawsuit and end up taking a license later. The key is to have a plan, and implement it diligently, with good counsel supporting the effort.</p>
        <p id="auto_446df5a7-4e96-4d50-9ae6-4c7ca90ae5c8_eip-935">Thus, the first step in deciding if and how you will enforce your patent is deciding what you want to achieve and how much effort, and money, you are willing to devote to the endeavor. The &#x201C;costs&#x201D; of enforcement are not limited to
      the out-of-pocket expenses for lawyers and litigation expenses. Any enforcement effort requires the time and attention of the patentee, whether an individual or company, which disrupts normal business activities. The time and attention required
      includes providing information and documents, reviewing pleadings prepared by your lawyers, analyzing information received from your opponent during the litigation, appearing for depositions and other pretrial proceedings, and appearing at trial.
      Just the information and document gathering can consume hundreds, even thousands, of person hours and disrupt the normal operations of virtually every part of an organization.</p>
        <p id="auto_446df5a7-4e96-4d50-9ae6-4c7ca90ae5c8_eip-786">Enforcing a patent also takes time. Lawsuits typically take two to four years to reach trial. Post-trial proceedings can take another six months to a year, and appeals take several additional years before the lawsuit is &#x201C;finished.&#x201D;</p>
        <p id="auto_446df5a7-4e96-4d50-9ae6-4c7ca90ae5c8_eip-51">On the positive side, successful patentees can reap huge monetary damages for another&#x2019;s patent infringement, including lost profits, treble damages (i.e., triple the amount of money damages found), and, in exceptional cases, an
      award of the patentee&#x2019;s attorneys&#x2019; fees. Awards of tens to hundreds of millions, and occasionally even billions, of dollars can be achieved, even if they are not typical. If you sell a product or service and are asserting your patent against a
      competitor, you can also obtain an injunction barring your competitor from continuing its infringement. This can reap huge additional rewards, measured in increased market share and pricing power.</p>
        <p id="auto_446df5a7-4e96-4d50-9ae6-4c7ca90ae5c8_eip-519" class="has-noteref">Patents not only offer patentees the opportunity to play offense in the marketplace, but also provide a very potent defense against charges of infringement (or other claims) by others. Competitors are wary of attacking businesses
      with extensive patent portfolios. The recent &#x201C;smartphone wars&#x201D; are a timely example. After becoming embroiled in patent litigation with Apple and Oracle over its Android operating system and the phones that use it, Google spent $12.5 billion to
      acquire Motorola Mobility in August 2011 to gain access to its extensive patent portfolio so that it would have patent weapons of its own.<a href="#auto_446df5a7-4e96-4d50-9ae6-4c7ca90ae5c8_footnote5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">v</a>
      Google also acquired 1,023 more patents from IBM for an undisclosed amount around the same time.<a href="#auto_446df5a7-4e96-4d50-9ae6-4c7ca90ae5c8_footnote6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">vi</a>
      Perhaps this was also partly in response to Apple joining with BlackBerry maker Research In Motion (RIM), Microsoft, Ericsson, Sony, and EMC to buy 6,000 patents owned by Nortel for $4.5 billion in July 2011, largely to keep them from falling into
      the hands of competitors like Google and Samsung.<a href="#auto_446df5a7-4e96-4d50-9ae6-4c7ca90ae5c8_footnote7" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">vii</a>

    </p>
        <section data-depth="1" id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-3863">
          <h3 data-type="title">Who</h3>
          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-386">First you decide whom to sue. Many options may exist. If the infringer is a corporation, you can sue it. But you can also sue its owners and/or officers if it is a closely held company or is dominated by a single shareholder or
      manager. If the infringer has subsidiaries, you must choose which of them to include as defendants. Recall that your patent gives you the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing your invention in the
      territory the patent covers. (We will assume for simplicity that you own a U.S. patent; foreign patents can be obtained in other countries and enforcement of those foreign patents is subject to their local laws.) Any person or entity that violates
      one of these exclusive rights is a potential defendant.</p>
          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-720">Strategic issues should be considered in deciding whom to sue. For example, the location of one or more defendants may make it hard to include them in a lawsuit filed in a place (&#x201C;forum&#x201D;) convenient to you. Although the infringer&#x2019;s
      customers are also infringers (i.e., they &#x201C;use&#x201D; the infringing product or service), most patentees disfavor suing customers because these are also the patentee&#x2019;s customers or potential customers&#x2014;and suing them may be bad for business. Often, the
      manufacturer or seller of the infringing product or service indemnifies and defends its customers. In other words, in many cases the manufacturer or seller of a product will agree to &#x201C;cover&#x201D; its customers in the event of a patent infringement claim.
      So, if the infringing manufacturer and/or seller is already a defendant, you gain little by suing customers, except their ire! Thus, select your defendants carefully, with your desired end result in mind.</p>
          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-227" class="has-noteref">Another strategic decision, when more than one infringer exists, is whether to sue them one at a time or collectively.<a href="#auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_footnote8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">viii</a>
      Common sense might suggest suing them one at a time, to avoid having them gang up on you. But experience shows that suing multiple defendants simultaneously is often a better strategy. It turns out that, in many cases, rather than encouraging them to
      gang up on you, they spend most of their energy trying to sort out differences among themselves and trying to present a united front.</p>
          <aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_footnote8"><div data-type="footnote-number">viii</div>
        Prior to the America Invents Act (AIA) in 2011, joinder rules allowed you to sue multiple infringers in the same lawsuit, even if their products were different. The AIA limited this ability by restricting joinder. Nevertheless, you can still file a
        separate lawsuit against each alleged infringer, and ask the court to consolidate them for discovery and other pretrial purposes. Courts are usually eager to do this because it simplifies their work. The practical effect is almost the same as a
        single case with multiple defendants.
      </aside>
          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-726">Although the America Invents Act narrowed the joinder rule in patent cases beginning in September, 2011 to cases where a plaintiff can show a &#x201C;common question of law or fact&#x201D; as well as a true &#x201C;transaction or occurrence&#x201D; between
      the defendants (which must be more than infringement of the same patent), judges still typically consolidate separate cases involving the same patent for their own convenience in handling discovery and pre-trial issues. Thus, proceeding
      simultaneously against multiple defendants can still be an effective strategy.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">What</h3>
          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-617">Which patents (if you have more than one) and which claims of those patents you assert in a lawsuit is another important decision you must make. Twenty years ago, you could simply file a lawsuit against an alleged infringer,
      listing your patent(s) and little more. You could defer deciding which claims to assert against which allegedly infringing products or services until after you received information from the defendant(s) through discovery in the litigation. However,
      courts now routinely require that you provide details in the
      <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_term21" group-by="c">complaint</span>
      you file, or shortly after, about which patent claims are asserted against which product or service, and also that you provide a &#x201C;claim chart&#x201D; that details those assertions precisely. Although it is possible to revise these assertions after receiving
      more information during the discovery process, your initial assertions remain in the court&#x2019;s record and can come back to haunt you if they are not consistent with your revised assertions. Therefore, careful pre-filing investigation and analysis is
      crucial to a successful pursuit of the infringers.</p>
          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-738">Ideally, hire not only an experienced patent trial lawyer to guide this effort, but also the experts you will rely on in the litigation, and who will testify during the trial on how and why the accused products or services infringe
      your patent(s). Experts can provide essential evidence of the infringement during the trial. Good experts are critical to success in litigation, as much as experienced trial lawyers, but are sometimes surprisingly hard to find. First, you must find
      an expert who is neutral, or at least appears so. Most experts are employed in the same field as the patentee and the alleged infringer, making them potentially unsuitable candidates because they have allegiances to existing companies that suggest
      the possibility of bias. Second, a good expert must not only know their subject thoroughly, but also be able to communicate it to a lay audience (i.e., the nonexpert judge and jury). Such communication skills are not always found in experts with
      strong technical credentials. Finally, you want an expert who has the right skills, but not one who appears to be a hired gun (exemplified by someone who spends most of their time testifying for a fee).</p>
          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-561">Thus, prepare in advance, and hire experts early in the process, both to assist your preparations and to remain available during the progress of the lawsuit and for trial.</p>

As we have noted, patent infringement cases seeking damages can only be filed in U.S. federal courts (as opposed to state courts). If your defendant
      is a private party, the proper location for the case (called &#x201C;<span data-type="term" id="auto_page_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_term22" group-by="v">venue</span>&#x201D;) is the federal district court in the geographic location where the defendant is incorporated or resides, or where the claim arose.<a href="#auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_footnote9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">ix</a>

        If the alleged infringer is the federal government itself, or a government contractor, the proper venue is the Court of Federal Claims. 28 U.S.C. &#xA7;1491 Another forum for enforcing a U.S. patent against imported goods exists at the U.S. International
        Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington, D.C. 19 U.S.C. &#xA7;1330. The ITC has the power to investigate alleged infringement and bar goods found to infringe from entering the country. This can be a very effective tool against infringing imports, especially
        if all the sources of those imports are unknown. The ITC&#x2019;s jurisdiction is &#x201C;quasi in rem&#x201D; so that the infringing goods themselves provide the basis for jurisdiction, allowing their adjudication and prohibition even if the source of the goods is
        unknown. Proceedings before the ITC are extremely expedited, usually taking 18 months or less, and can be very expensive.

          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-739">The first two criteria are usually easily determined&#x2014;i.e., a company&#x2019;s state of incorporation is a matter of public record, as are the places where it has facilities. The place where the claim arose includes every place the
      infringing product or service is made, sold, offered for sale, used, or imported. If it is a low volume product or service, or is very new or lightly distributed, the proper venues may be quite limited. But typically products or services with enough
      sales to justify a multimillion dollar patent infringement lawsuit are broadly available throughout the country, opening up virtually any federal court as a possible venue.</p>
          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-321">Thus, you can, and should, select a venue that meets your objectives as closely as possible. Some venues (e.g., the Eastern District of Virginia and the Western District of Wisconsin) have reputations (and rules) for moving cases
      through to trial very quickly, often in less than a year. Speed is desirable in terms of reaching a conclusion quickly, but has its downsides in terms of accelerated costs and maximum disruption to the normal business operations of you and your
      opponent. Other districts exhibit much slower progress toward trial, which may be desirable or undesirable in meeting your particular objectives.</p>
          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-776">Another factor is experience. Some district courts have handled many complex patent cases, have detailed rules about what must be done to get the case ready for trial, and an excellent track record on appeal. Still other districts
      have reputations for being &#x201C;plaintiff friendly&#x201D; or &#x201C;defendant friendly,&#x201D; although these reputations are often more &#x201C;urban legend&#x201D; than accurate. In any given case, the outcome is dependent on the parties, the facts, the lawyers, and the judge/jury
      assigned.</p>

          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-168">The timing of filing suit is often dictated by when you discover the existence of the infringement and have gathered the required information for drafting a complaint and the necessary initial disclosures. But other considerations
      may be relevant also, such as the timing of industry trade shows, holiday sales pushes, or the financing activities of your opponent. Absent any other constraints or objectives, lawsuits should usually be filed as soon after the infringing activity
      is discovered as possible, given the need to investigate and prepare before filing a complaint.

          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-499">At the outside, any suit filed more than six years after the infringement began and was reasonably capable of being discovered can give rise to a defense of &#x201C;<span data-type="term" id="auto_page_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_term23" group-by="l">laches</span>&#x201D; and/or &#x201C;<span data-type="term" id="auto_page_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_term24" group-by="e">estoppel</span>&#x201D;by your opponent. In other words,the accused infringer is arguing that you waited too long to bring your infringement claim. It may be necessary for you to prove that the defendant was not prejudiced by your delay. If laches applies, which simply means you waited an unreasonable time tomake your claim, prejudicing your opponent, your damages will be limited to those that arise after you filed your lawsuit. If estoppel applies, which means that you not only delayed, but affirmatively misled your opponent into believing you would not file suit, your claim is barred altogether.</p>
          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-614" class="has-noteref">Another issue you face is whether to notify the alleged infringer before filing suit. This seems prudent&#x2014;demand that the infringer cease the infringement before filing a lawsuit aimed at enforcing such cessation. But such a
      strategy is fraught with pitfalls. First, accusing someone of infringement allows them to sue you preemptively, asking the court for a quick decision that no infringement exists. This type of judicial decision is called a declaratory judgment of
      noninfringement.<a href="#auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_footnote10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">x</a>
      If the accused infringer sues you before you sue them, the accused infringer becomes the plaintiff and can sue in a forum of their choice. Ceding to your opponent the initiative and the choice of forum for the litigation is a strategic blunder that
      could cost you not just that battle, but the war. Second, an old adage applies here: If you are going to kick someone, don&#x2019;t warn them, because they will prepare to deflect the blow. Patent litigation (like all litigation) is like war, albeit
      civilized war. Ceding to your opponent important strategic advantages, such as the choice of forum and the element of surprise, is costly and can be fatal.

      a demand that the infringer cease the infringing activities. You can defer formally &#x201C;serving&#x201D; the lawsuit on your opponent (that is, providing notice by delivering the complaint) for at least 30 days, and as long as 90 days in some courts. This
      allows you to negotiate with your opponent from a position of strength and with your choice of forum firmly established, without appearing unreasonable.</p>

          <p id="auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_eip-973" class="has-noteref">Once you choose to file suit in federal court, the how is largely dictated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the loal rules of the chosen venue. However, one important decision remains-judge or jury.<a href="#auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_footnote11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xi</a>
      Until the 1990s, almost all patent cases were tried to a judge because they were thought to be too complex for juries. but then some enterprising plaintiffs' lawyers decided to request that a jury decide their case, perhaps seeking to take advantage
      of the complexity of the cases and the belief that juries trust patents because they are issued by the federal government after examination by USPTO experts. That has led to the current reality, which is that almost all patent cases filed now request
      a jury trial. Interestingly, statistics show that this trend does not always benefit plaintiffs. Depending on the venue, plaintiffs only win 60 to 75 percent of the time, despite having the advantage of being able to pick what cases they file
      (presumably they self-select only the strongest cases) and where they file them (i.e., they can select what they think is the most favorable forum&#x2014;often their own hometown).<a href="#auto_885e67b6-2464-4ffb-8545-6c7f4750cf4d_footnote12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xii</a>
      Of course, the outcome of a particular case depends on a myriad of factors unique to that case. No party can be assured victory when a jury is involved.</p>

      The defendant(s) must then decide whether to move to dismiss or transfer the case to a different venue, or file an answer (a response to the infringement claim).<a href="#auto_66291487-c148-4372-89be-a73d1616c742_footnote14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xiv</a>

      Motions to dismiss may be based on any number of issues&#x2014;improper jurisdiction (e.g., the court does not have power over the defendant because it does not reside or do business within the geographic jurisdiction of that court), improper venue (e.g.,
      the defendant does not reside or did not commit any act of infringement in the jurisdiction of the court), failure to state a proper claim, etc.<a href="#auto_66291487-c148-4372-89be-a73d1616c742_footnote16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xvi</a>
      Such a motion must be accompanied by a legal brief explaining the reasons for the motion, to which the plaintiff can file an opposing brief. The defendant who filed the motion usually has an opportunity to file a reply brief. After the briefing is
      completed, which can take one to two months, the court will decide the motion with an order, either granting or denying it.

      hearings as of March, 2016. Second, a defendant requesting post-grant review usually asks the court to

      with the litigation. This strategy has been successful in many courts.</p>

      Initial disclosures must provide preliminary information about each party&#x2019;s positions in the case, and disclose the identity and location of witnesses and documents likely to be relevant to the issues in the case.<a href="#auto_ba45aebd-c516-42c8-be1d-c760073b36b8_footnote26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xxvi</a>
      These disclosures help frame the &#x201C;discovery,&#x201D; or information that the parties can request of each other, which is one of the hallmarks of litigation in the United States and one of the drivers of the expense of litigation. The concept is
      laudable&#x2014;require each party to disclose the information it has relevant to the case to preclude a &#x201C;trial by ambush.&#x201D; But, in practice, discovery can become an endless game of cat and mouse, with costs escalating exponentially. We will talk more about
      discovery shortly.

        <p id="auto_ba45aebd-c516-42c8-be1d-c760073b36b8_eip-151">The preliminary pretrial conference is usually the first time the parties appear in court before the judge, unless there has been a hearing on a pretrial motion (as discussed above). At this conference, the judge discusses with the
      parties the issues likely to arise in the case, the time that pretrial discovery is expected to take, and any issues that make the case unique (such as witnesses in foreign countries that require extraordinary means to obtain their testimony for
      trial). Each party is usually required to submit a report to the court in advance of this conference, proposing what the timeline for the case should be and identifying any unique issues. The court typically issues a
      <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_ba45aebd-c516-42c8-be1d-c760073b36b8_term32" group-by="s">scheduling order</span>
      at, or shortly after, the pretrial conference, specifying dates by which certain activities must be concluded. This order often &#x201C;splits the baby&#x201D; between the plaintiff&#x2019;s and defendant&#x2019;s proposed schedules (the plaintiff usually seeks speed while the
      defendant usually seeks delay). The figure below shows a typical scheduling order.</p>
        <p id="auto_ba45aebd-c516-42c8-be1d-c760073b36b8_eip-669">The scheduling order will also usually specify a length of the trial (e.g., 8 trial days), subject to revision at the final pretrial conference. A typical patent trial is scheduled to last from 5 to 20 trial days, but some can take
      much longer. Let&#x2019;s look at each step of this schedule to understand what is happening.</p>

      This is important to all parties, and even third parties that may be asked to produce information during discovery, because sensitive business, technical, and financial information is routinely requested by and produced to each party during the
      lawsuit. The protective order proscribes that the disclosure of confidential information during discovery is limited to lawyers involved in handling the case, outside experts retained by the lawyers to assist them, and court reporters (who record
      testimony during the case), videographers (who videotape deposition testimony, as is now common), and court personnel. It is also typical that certain employees of each party (usually in-house lawyers and/or business people directly involved in the
      oversight of the case) are also permitted to review certain materials, but not financial information of a competitor or future business plans, which are usually excluded from being disclosed to any party employees.</p>

      This is similar to eliciting testimony during a trial, but occurs in a conference room with a court reporter present to record what is said. The judge is not present at depositions, but may intervene if a controversy arises. Testimony can also be
      requested by written questions to a witness, which the witness then answers and returns to the requesting party, called a deposition by written questions.<a href="#auto_ba45aebd-c516-42c8-be1d-c760073b36b8_footnote34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xxxiv</a>

      demeanor in person, testimony elicited via depositions during discovery may be used at trial under certain circumstances.<a href="#auto_ba45aebd-c516-42c8-be1d-c760073b36b8_footnote35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xxxv</a>
      For example, if a witness dies before trial, or is unavailable through no fault of the party seeking to use the deposition testimony, the deposition may be used as testimony at trial in lieu of live testimony from the witness. Also, the deposition
      testimony of an opposing party or an officer or manager of the opposing party corporation may be used at trial for any purpose. Usually, however, deposition testimony is used primarily to &#x201C;impeach&#x201D; a witness testifying live at trial&#x2014;that is, to show
      that the witness at trial has changed prior testimony from when they gave the deposition. Videotaped deposition testimony is very effective to show to a judge or jury during trial that the witness has changed the testimony&#x2014;such
      as from &#x201C;No&#x201D; to &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; or the equivalent!

      from specific to general, in an effort by the patentee (and lawyer) to cover as much territory for the claim as possible. The PTO interprets proposed claims in the broadest reasonable way possible, and then compares their scope with the
      prior art, before allowing them. The goal of the patentee in dealing with the PTO is to get allowed the broadest claims possible, in order to get the broadest patent coverage possible. But the use of broad, general language in claims permits the
      parties in later litigation to argue for different interpretations, depending on their interests at the time of litigation. Thus, a plaintiff seeks an interpretation that is broad enough to encompass the defendant&#x2019;s products and services so that
      infringement can be proven. In contrast, the defendant proposes a narrow interpretation (or &#x201C;construction&#x201D;) that excludes its products and services.

          <p id="auto_ba45aebd-c516-42c8-be1d-c760073b36b8_eip-821">The court resolves the dispute over the meaning of the contested claim terms by referring to the language of the claims, the language and drawings in the patent, and the history of the proceedings in the PTO that led to the
      issuance of the patent. The written record of that history is preserved in what is call a &#x201C;file wrapper,&#x201D; so named because all the written documents making up the history are contained in a three-part file folder, the two outer portions of which fold
      over and &#x201C;wrap&#x201D; the documents within it. The patentee is bound by what it told the PTO to secure allowance of the patent. The court interprets the language according to its ordinary meaning to someone of ordinary skill in the art to which the
      invention pertains, unless the patentee specially defined the language within the patent or its file wrapper.</p>

      That is, if one party can show that the evidence is so clear that no fact dispute exists (i.e., no reasonable fact finder, whether judge or jury, could decide otherwise) and that the law requires the case be decided in favor of the party moving for
      summary judgment, the court can decide the case without holding a trial. The judge must decide such motions based only on the applicable law (which the judge determines), the evidence (i.e., documents, interrogatory answers, admissions, and
      deposition testimony) developed during discovery, and the court&#x2019;s claim construction decision, giving the benefit of any doubt about the facts to the nonmoving party. If the court finds that a fact relevant to the outcome is in dispute, summary
      judgment must be denied and a trial held to resolve that factual dispute.</p>

          <p id="auto_ba45aebd-c516-42c8-be1d-c760073b36b8_eip-551">Understandably, these are hotly contested motions. The moving party hopes to avoid the need for a trial, and the uncertainty a jury introduces, by having the judge decide the case in its favor early on. The nonmoving party wants to
      go to trial, and hope that the fluid events that are the essence of a jury trial will convince the jury to decide the case in its favor.</p>
          <p id="auto_ba45aebd-c516-42c8-be1d-c760073b36b8_eip-636">In recent years, most patent cases are resolved on summary judgment and only a handful go to trial (about 100 per year throughout the country). The primary reason for this phenomenon is the advent of the claim construction
      (Markman) hearing and the decision by the court, before trial, about how the language of the asserted claims must be interpreted. The court&#x2019;s claim construction decision resolves most of the uncertainty in a patent case, because what the accused
      products or services are, and how they operate, is rarely in dispute by the time discovery concludes.</p>
          <p id="auto_ba45aebd-c516-42c8-be1d-c760073b36b8_eip-979">The end result is that the case is often either settled after the claim construction decision, or decided in favor of one side or the other at the summary judgment stage. If summary judgment is granted, the losing party can appeal
      the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which is the appellate court to which all decisions in patent cases are appealed.</p>

      It typically identifies all the positions of each party, every issue in dispute in the case that must be resolved by order of the court or at trial, all the documents the parties may seek to introduce into evidence at the trial, and each witness that
      is expected to be called to testify, either live or via their deposition. The judge issues the order based on a draft prepared by the parties and once issued, it defines the issues that may be raised at the trial. If there is to be a jury trial, the
      order can rarely be modified after the final pretrial conference. If the trial is before the judge only (referred to as a &#x201C;bench trial&#x201D;), the judge may be more lenient in allowing modifications to the final pretrial order because he is the person
      deciding the case and can adjust more readily than a jury.</p>

          <p id="auto_cc94f918-9591-4f86-9316-e26879d52dd6_eip-794">The trial begins with the selection of the jury. The jury is selected (or &#x201C;picked&#x201D;) from a group of prospective jurors called to court to serve in accordance with the laws and practices of the local jurisdiction.</p>
          <p id="auto_cc94f918-9591-4f86-9316-e26879d52dd6_eip-809">Each judge has a procedure for picking a jury. Most involve a questionnaire that each prospective juror must complete and provide to the judge and the parties&#x2019; lawyers. The answers are intended to reveal whether any
      reason exists why a prospective juror should not serve on the jury. Typical reasons for excluding a prospective juror include that the juror works for or knows one of the lawyers in the case, works for or does business with one of the parties, has a
      close relative that works for one of the parties, knows something about the subject matter of the case, or is unable to serve because of a disability or a previously planned vacation for which they have already purchased a nonrefundable ticket.
      The judge also typically asks the prospective jurors whether they have a bias or prejudice that would prevent them from making a fair decision.</p>
          <p id="auto_cc94f918-9591-4f86-9316-e26879d52dd6_eip-528" class="has-noteref">Once the judge has &#x201C;excused&#x201D; from serving any prospective jurors for &#x201C;cause&#x201D; (i.e., because of one of the reasons listed above or some other reason that court believes provides good cause for excusing that person), the clerk
      selects at random from the remaining prospective jurors the number that will be seated as the jury, plus six. The number of jurors seated in a case depends on the expected length of the trial and the practices of that judge. At least six and no more
      than twelve jurors must decide a case, but any number between six and twelve can be seated.<a href="#auto_cc94f918-9591-4f86-9316-e26879d52dd6_footnote42" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xlii</a>
      The reason a court usually seats more than six jurors is to assure that the trial will end with at least the minimum of six jurors necessary to decide the case even if one or more jurors need to be excused during the trial, such as for illness or
      emergency. Judges typically seat seven to nine jurors for this reason. Only rarely do judges in civil patent cases seat a full twelve jurors, because once seated a juror must participate in reaching the decision (unless excused for cause), and all
      jury decisions in federal cases, including patent cases, must be unanimous.<a href="#auto_cc94f918-9591-4f86-9316-e26879d52dd6_footnote43" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">xliii</a>
      The general rule is, the more jurors there are, the longer it takes for them to reach a unanimous verdict, and the higher the likelihood that the case will result in a &#x201C;hung&#x201D; jury (i.e., an inability for the jury to reach a unanimous decision).</p>

      judge has decided the jury should begin with eight jurors, the clerk will select 14 so that the plaintiff and defendant (collectively if there is more than one plaintiff and/or defendant) are each able to strike or eliminate three prospective jurors,
      leaving eight to hear the case.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Opening Statements</h3>
          <p id="auto_cc94f918-9591-4f86-9316-e26879d52dd6_eip-276">The next step is the opening statements by the opposing parties, starting with the plaintiff and followed by the defendant. If there are multiple plaintiffs or defendants, the judge will give equal time to each side
      and let the individual parties work out the allocation of time. The opening statement is intended to provide a road map for the jury about what the party intends to prove, and is expected to be devoid of argument. But lawyers rarely present an
      opening statement without some argument. The judge can intercede, and an opposing party may object, if a party crosses the &#x201C;no argument&#x201D; line too far.</p>
          <p id="auto_cc94f918-9591-4f86-9316-e26879d52dd6_eip-848">The opening statements are where many believe the trial is won or lost because the jury forms initial opinions about who is right and who is wrong in the case based on what they hear at this beginning stage. Thus, each party&#x2019;s
      trial lawyer tries to craft a story to tell that casts their client in the best possible light. Trials can be likened to a morality play, in which each party tries to cast themselves as in the right, and the opponent as doing them wrong. In patent
      cases, plaintiffs often portray defendants as thieving freeloaders, attempting to benefit unfairly from the inventiveness of the plaintiff rather than invest in developing their own products. Defendants, on the other hand, often portray patentees as
      greedy monopolists, trying to stifle competition and deny consumers choice and less-expensive alternatives.</p>
          <p id="auto_cc94f918-9591-4f86-9316-e26879d52dd6_eip-991">Whether or not the common wisdom is correct, it is with the opening statements that the jurors begin their struggle to find truth among the competing stories they will hear during the trial.</p>

          <p id="auto_cc94f918-9591-4f86-9316-e26879d52dd6_eip-950">The plaintiff then presents its case, calling witnesses and introducing exhibits that support its positions. Each opposing party has the opportunity to object to exhibits and testimony, and to cross-examine
      witnesses. The judge rules on all objections and generally oversees the proceedings to assure that the trial is conducted properly. After the plaintiff rests its case, the defendant presents its defense, again by introducing exhibits and offering
      testimony from witnesses. The trial concludes with the plaintiff calling rebuttal witnesses, who are limited to rebutting testimony from the defendant&#x2019;s witnesses. Each side usually calls one or more experts to testify on the issues of infringement
      and validity (or invalidity), as well as on damages.

          <h3 data-type="title">Closing Arguments</h3>
          <p id="auto_cc94f918-9591-4f86-9316-e26879d52dd6_eip-680">After the evidence has been presented, the parties make their closing arguments. Usually the plaintiff goes first, followed by the defendant. The plaintiff has the opportunity to reserve time for rebuttal if it
      chooses. In some jurisdictions, the defendant must go first and the plaintiff next. In this case, the plaintiff has the last word, and the defendant does not have any opportunity for rebuttal.</p>
          <p id="auto_cc94f918-9591-4f86-9316-e26879d52dd6_eip-832">Closing arguments give each party the opportunity to highlight what they believe is the critical evidence in their favor, and attack the deficiencies in their opponent&#x2019;s case. It is here that an observer would see the greatest
      geographic diversity in style and practice. Quite apart from the different styles of trial lawyers and judges across the country, jurors in different parts of the country expect different things from trials, and especially from closing arguments.
      Thus, an observer would see a very different &#x201C;show&#x201D; during a closing argument in the Eastern District of Texas than in the District of Maine.</p>

      These questions typically list the accused product(s) and the asserted claim(s) and require the jury to decide infringement and validity for each claim and accused product separately. If appropriate, the jury may also be asked to decide what damages,
      if any, are to be awarded the plaintiff and whether any infringement they may have found to exist was willful or not.

          <p id="auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_eip-902">Issues arise in most patent cases that must be decided by the judge and not the jury. Many of these are called &#x201C;equitable&#x201D; issues because they are left to the sound, equitable discretion of the court. The most
      common equitable issues are the defense of inequitable conduct and the affirmative claims of willfulness and exceptional case.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Inequitable Conduct</h3>
          <p id="auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_eip-574">Misconduct by the patentee in dealing with the Patent and Trademark Office, through which the patentee or its attorney deceives or misleads the patent examiner in an effort to persuade the examiner to grant the
      patent, was historically called &#x201C;fraud on the Patent Office,&#x201D; but more recently has been renamed &#x201C;inequitable conduct.&#x201D; A defendant can raise this issue as a defense, which if proven results in the patent being unenforceable&#x2014;that is, the patentee is
      unable to enforce the patent or recover any damages for its infringement. Many different types of inequitable conduct have been found to render patents unenforceable, from outright fabrications of alleged evidence of unexpected results in the
      development of the invention, to hiding relevant prior art showing prior solutions to the problem solved by the patent, to failing to tell the patent examiner that another patent examiner had rejected a related application.</p>
          <p id="auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_eip-500">Most district courts defer ruling on inequitable conduct defenses until after the liability trial addressing infringement, validity, and damages. This is a commonsense attempt at efficiency because if the patent is found invalid or
      not infringed at trial, the inequitable conduct issues became moot. Only if the patent is found valid and infringed does the court need to hold a separate hearing to adduce evidence of alleged inequitable conduct. The court then decides whether such
      conduct had been proven, which is exceedingly rare. Nevertheless, because the consequences of such a finding essentially kill the patent, defendants assert inequitable conduct whenever possible in a final effort to avoid liability.

      In an effort to stem the spread of this plague, the Federal Circuit sought to restrict its use by holding that inequitable conduct must be established by clear and convincing evidence of deceptive intent. Gross negligence does not suffice and &#x201C;does

        the law came to demand a perfection that few could attain in the complexities of patent practice. The result was not simply the elimination of fraudulently obtained patents, when such situations existed. The consequences were disproportionately

          <p id="auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_eip-952" class="has-noteref">Finally, on May 25, 2011, the Federal Circuit restricted the doctrine of inequitable conduct by changing the standard for materiality and clarifying the requirements for finding intent to deceive.<a href="#auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_footnote54" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">liv</a>
      To find inequitable conduct, the court held that the party alleging unenforceability must prove a specific intent to deceive the USPTO by clear and convincing evidence. Moreover, the decision to deceive the USPTO must be knowing and deliberate. The
      court also clarified that district courts may not use a &#x201C;sliding scale&#x201D; to find intent. In other words, the Federal Circuit held it improper to find that a weak showing of intent was sufficient based on a strong showing that the information was
      material, or that a weak showing of materiality was sufficient based on a strong showing of intent. Although intent can be inferred to meet the clear and convincing evidence standard, specific intent to deceive must be &#x201C;the single most reasonable
      inference able to be drawn from the evidence.&#x201D;</p>

          <p id="auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_eip-201">Regarding materiality, the court required a &#x201C;but- for materiality&#x201D; standard. In other words, the standard for materiality now requires that &#x201C;but for&#x201D; the alleged deception, the USPTO would not have allowed the claim. Further, &#x201C;[i]n
      making this patentability determination, the court should apply the preponderance of the evidence standard and give claims their broadest reasonable construction.&#x201D; The court also recognized an exception to the requirement for but-for materiality,
      finding that &#x201C;[w]hen the patentee has engaged in affirmative acts of egregious misconduct, such as the filing of an unmistakably false affidavit, the misconduct is material.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_eip-310">The number of successful inequitable conduct defenses asserted has plummeted due to the strict new requirements for pleading and proving inequitable conduct imposed by the
      <em data-effect="italics">Therasense</em>
      decision. District courts are dispensing with many allegations of inequitable conduct now at the pleading stage, eliminating the need for separate hearings on inequitable conduct issues.</p>
          <p id="auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_eip-458">Misuse of a patent is sometimes treated as a form of inequitable conduct, but it is more commonly treated as a separate affirmative defense. The elements of misuse are either a violation of antitrust laws or an effort to expand the
      scope or term of a patent beyond appropriate limits. For example, it is patent misuse for a patentee to file suit against products of a defendant that are far beyond the proper scope of any claims of the patentee&#x2019;s patent, or to seek damages or an
      injunction beyond the expiration of the patent. Often such unreasonable demands are accompanied by threats to the defendant&#x2019;s customers. If the misuse is proved, the patentee could be barred from recovering any damages until it has &#x201C;purged&#x201D; the
      misuse by abandoning its unreasonable assertions and dissipating any negative effects they caused.</p>

          <p id="auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_eip-428">If the jury (or judge, in a bench trial) finds that the asserted patent has been infringed, it is often asked to determine whether such infringement was &#x201C;<span data-type="term" id="auto_page_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_term35" group-by="w">willful</span>.&#x201D;A finding of willful infringement allows the judge to award enhanced damages under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7; 284, which provides in relevant part that the court may increase the damages award by up to three times the amount found. This is a potent consequence of a showing that a defendant&#x2019;s infringement was willful.</p>
          <p id="auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_eip-414" class="has-noteref">The standard for showing willfulness has evolved over the years, but in 2007, the Federal Circuit significantly altered the standard governing willful infringement by requiring the patentee to prove that (1) the accused infringer
      &#x201C;acted despite an objectively high likelihood that its actions constituted infringement of a valid patent,&#x201D; and (2) the &#x201C;objectively defined risk . . . was either known or so obvious that it should have been known to the accused infringer.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_footnote55" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">lv</a>
      The first prong of this test is objective, whereas the second prong is subjective and involves the accused infringer&#x2019;s actual state of mind. Each prong requires that the infringer knew the patent existed at the time it infringed.

This practice is thought to make sense when the
      field is very crowded (i.e., there are many patents owned by different patentees covering many different aspects of a product or service) because trying to uncover all the potentially relevant patents that could be asserted against a new product or
      service is extremely costly, if not impossible. This practice is used most frequently by large companies that can afford to deal with a patent infringement lawsuit should one be filed. Small companies and entrepreneurs, especially in emerging fields,
      often take great care to search for and work around any existing patents that might be close to their new product or service because they can ill afford patent litigation. Of course, searching for potentially troublesome patents and trying to avoid
      them is no guarantee of not getting sued. Not only are there more than two million patents in force,<a href="#auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_footnote56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">lvi</a>

      willfully ignored the patentee&#x2019;s rights, but also bolstered the underlying issue of infringement itself. Post-<em data-effect="italics">Bard</em>, the patentee can only present willfulness evidence if it is able to convince a more dispassionate judge that the defendant acted objectively recklessly, which is a higher hurdle to overcome.</p>
          <p id="auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_eip-930">If the patentee convinces the judge on the objective prong, and the jury on the subjective prong, resulting in a jury verdict of willful infringement, the issue of enhanced damages passes back to the court for determination after the trial.</p>

However, patentees who are not competitors of the infringer are usually unsuccessful in convincing courts that they are entitled to injunctive
      relief, and are left with only money damages(usually an on going reasonable royalty) to compensate for future infringement. This removes the most serious risk an alleged infringer faces&#x2014;being barred from the market&#x2014;making fighting cases through trial
      more palatable than before. This new rule from the Supreme Court has driven many plaintiffs out of federal court and into the International Trade Commission (ITC), when the allegedly infringing products are imported, because the ITC issues exclusion
      orders and cease and desist orders (roughly equivalent to federal court injunctions barring further sales) without regard to the requirements the Supreme Court laid down in the

          <p id="auto_d7d26af1-3926-42fe-9b48-0a10c4675ece_eip-194">Called a &#x201C;JMOL&#x201D; motion, the premise of a motion for judgment as a matter of law is that the jury did not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for deciding the case as it did, and the court
      should intervene and decide the case in favor of the party moving for the JMOL. The moving party must explain in detail what legally required evidence is missing from the trial record. The opposing party (i.e., the party that won the jury verdict)
      then has the opportunity to identify in the trial record where the allegedly missing evidence is found, and the judge decides who is correct. The court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Thus, most JMOL
      motions fail. But the losing party always files such a motion because it is a chance to challenge the jury&#x2019;s verdict and avoid the remedies the winning party is demanding.</p>

This is the one federal appellate court in the United States that hears all appealed cases
      involving patent disputes. Almost all patent cases that conclude with a trial, or after a decision on summary judgment, are appealed. This is partly because the cost of an appeal is orders of magnitude less than the case up to that point (e.g., tens
      or hundreds of thousands of dollars vs. hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars). In addition, overall the Federal Circuit affirms in full less than 60 percent of the patent cases it decides on the merits.<a href="#auto_82762de8-83fa-4b4a-9495-caeddf978ff2_footnote69" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">lxviii</a>
      Thus, it is well worth it for the losing party to pursue an appeal, because overall it has a 40+ percent chance of partial or full relief from the judgment below. Of course, the reversal rate varies by the nature of the issues before the Federal
      Circuit and the standard of review the court applies. Legal issues (such as claim construction, summary judgment, and jury instructions) are reviewed
      <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_82762de8-83fa-4b4a-9495-caeddf978ff2_term37" group-by="d">de novo</span>, without deference to the district court&#x2019;s or jury&#x2019;s decision. This makes it much more likely that the Federal Circuit will reverse a decision because it need not give any deference to the decision of the district court.
      Fact issues (like infringement, many aspects of validity, and damages) are reviewed on a less flexible standard (i.e., does substantial evidence support the decision), such that the Federal Circuit (like the district court) is not free to substitute
      its own judgment for that of the jury. Evidentiary rulings, and other issues associated with how the trial was conducted are reviewed under the least flexible standard of review&#x2014;abuse of discretion. It is rare that the Federal Circuit finds that a
      district court abused its discretion.<a href="#auto_82762de8-83fa-4b4a-9495-caeddf978ff2_footnote70" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">lxix</a>

      granted in almost all patent appeals. The argument occurs in the Federal Circuit courthouse in Washington, D.C., before a panel of three judges, although yearly the Federal Circuit travels to other cities to hear arguments at local law schools, which
      allows students, local practitioners, and the public to attend more easily. The parties are typically given 15 minutes per side to make their arguments, and after the argument, the court renders a written decision within 3&#x2013;6 months.

      methodologies. A thriving business exists in the United States providing adversaries the resources to conduct mediations or arbitrations. Retired or former judges or lawyers are available to serve as mediators or arbitrators.
    </p>
        <p id="auto_2345e1a8-ef7b-4985-bbf6-e6718b36a884_eip-49">ADR is an increasingly popular way to resolve disputes because it is often faster, less expensive, and private, as compared with the public lawsuit procedures outlined above. The interactions among the parties and the
      mediators/arbitrators can be kept confidential, as can any settlements reached. Confidentiality is a driving force behind ADR.</p>
        <section data-depth="1" id="auto_2345e1a8-ef7b-4985-bbf6-e6718b36a884_eip-2213">
          <h3 data-type="title">Mediation</h3>
          <p id="auto_2345e1a8-ef7b-4985-bbf6-e6718b36a884_eip-221">Mediation is simply an exchange between adversaries overseen (i.e., &#x201C;mediated&#x201D;) by an individual with expertise and/ or training in helping parties reach agreement. Often, the mediator will require the parties to submit their
      positions and relevant documents in a pre-mediation brief. Usually, each pre-mediation brief is confidential and only seen by the mediator and the party submitting it (i.e., the opposing party does not see the other side&#x2019;s mediation brief). The
      mediator will review the materials submitted and then set a date for the parties to meet with the mediator, usually in the mediator&#x2019;s offices or a neutral location (such as a hotel conference room). Each party commits to bring to the mediation one or
      more people with the authority to settle, so that the people at the mediation can discuss the dispute and reach an agreement settling it without having to seek approval from others.</p>
          <p id="auto_2345e1a8-ef7b-4985-bbf6-e6718b36a884_eip-765">At the mediation, the mediator typically starts by meeting with all the parties together, and reviews the dispute and the issues that require settlement. The mediator will then meet with each party separately, engaging in &#x201C;shuttle
      diplomacy,&#x201D; in an attempt to bring the parties to a common middle ground. Occasionally, when it may appear that the parties&#x2019; respective positions leave a gap between them, the mediator may make a &#x201C;mediator&#x2019;s proposal&#x201D; that tries to bridge that gap.
      If the parties agree, typically a written agreement will be signed before they end the mediation&#x2014;which may be a list of terms for later fleshing out in a full agreement or an actual final settlement agreement. Because anything left to later
      discussion can give rise to further disputes, most mediators try to get the parties to a full, signed agreement before they depart the mediation.
    </p>
          <p id="auto_2345e1a8-ef7b-4985-bbf6-e6718b36a884_eip-413">Perhaps surprisingly to some, mediation often succeeds, if not the first time, then weeks or months later, after the parties have a chance to think things through. Mediations can be conducted while litigation is pending, or before
      litigation is filed. In the latter case, often the parties will sign a &#x201C;standstill agreement&#x201D; that promises that neither will file a lawsuit against the other on the subject matter of the mediation until they agree the mediation has failed.</p>
          <p id="auto_2345e1a8-ef7b-4985-bbf6-e6718b36a884_eip-616">District courts and the Federal Circuit often have mediation programs that attempt to help the parties resolve their disputes voluntarily. Increased attention is given to these programs as the resources of the courts have dwindled
      and the caseloads increased because each successful mediation is one less case that requires the resources of the court.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Arbitration</h3>
          <p id="auto_2345e1a8-ef7b-4985-bbf6-e6718b36a884_eip-405">The principal difference between mediation and arbitration is decisiveness. Mediations result in settlements only if all parties agree to a resolution. In most arbitrations (so-called &#x201C;binding arbitrations&#x201D;), the parties
      agree to be bound by the decision of the arbitrator(s). There is a nonbinding version of arbitration, where the parties ask the arbitrator(s) to render a decision, but do not agree to be bound by it. In practice, these are actually mediations because
      they result in a settlement only if all parties agree to the result. Such nonbinding arbitrations are most often used when the parties have attempted to reach a mediated settlement but reach an impasse on one or more critical issues. They may then
      agree to submit those impasses to nonbinding arbitration, where one or more arbitrators (usually experts on the subject matter of the impasse issues) evaluate the facts, as presented by the parties, and render a decision that the parties can review
      to understand how an impartial third party looks at the issues. This often helps the parties craft a mediated settlement on their own.

The parties may agree to submit their dispute to a single arbitrator (like a retired judge), but most often a panel of three arbitrators is
      appointed to hear the case. The parties may agree on all three arbitrators, drawn from a list of suitable candidates provided by the American Arbitration Association<a href="#auto_2345e1a8-ef7b-4985-bbf6-e6718b36a884_footnote72" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">lxxi</a>

          <p id="auto_2345e1a8-ef7b-4985-bbf6-e6718b36a884_eip-917">The parties agree on the rules that govern the arbitration, which can limit discovery, evidence, witnesses, and trial time, in whatever manner the parties agree. Once the parties agree on the rules, the arbitration is controlled by
      the arbitration panel, which enforces the rules and renders a binding decision. Usually, arbitration decisions are not appealable (except for gross malfeasance by the arbitrators), but the parties can provide for appeal rights if they choose. But
      prolonging the resolution of the dispute by allowing an appeal is contrary to the cost and time-savings objectives of most arbitrations.</p>
          <p id="auto_2345e1a8-ef7b-4985-bbf6-e6718b36a884_eip-699">Arbitrations have become particularly popular for resolving patent disputes that cross international borders and involve multiple patents issued by different countries. No one court can resolve such disputes, so international
      arbitration, with arbitrators expert in different countries&#x2019; laws can fill the gap.</p>

      patent suits were brought not by businesses making products covered by patents they owned and seeking to halt competitors believed to be infringing their patents, or even by small entities and entrepreneurs pursuing legitimate claims, but instead by
      what some detractors call &#x201C;patent trolls&#x201D; (after the mythical creatures that demanded payment for safe passage over a bridge).<a href="#auto_b37e26c5-d248-4989-8619-c36579b1218b_footnote73" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">lxxii</a>
      Although some have more recently attempted to discern a difference between what they consider &#x201C;good&#x201D; and &#x201C;bad&#x201D; trolls by labeling the former &#x201C;non-practicing entities&#x201D; (NPEs) or &#x201C;patent monetization entities&#x201D; (PMEs), for the purposes of this section,
      we will refer to such entities as trolls.

        In 2012, one article suggests 56 percent of patent infringement cases filed in the United States were Filed by trolls:

        <p id="auto_b37e26c5-d248-4989-8619-c36579b1218b_eip-588">As plaintiffs, trolls seek to take advantage of the fact that U.S. patent litigation costs have become so high that many defendants are willing to pay to make such cases go away. Trolls file lawsuits not to protect a business from
      an infringing competitor, but to derive settlement revenue from defendants willing to settle for less than litigation costs. Trolls often acquire patents of ambiguous scope and questionable value, file suit against multiple defendants, and rely on
      the presumption of validity accorded all issued patents to extract settlements for less than it would cost any one defendant to defend against the infringement claim. Because trolls have few documents other than the patents and their file histories,
      and even fewer employees, they are not subject to the outsized expense of discovery that a commercial business with warehouses of documents and scores of employees faces in patent litigation. Because discovery costs for such defendants are so much
      greater than for troll plaintiffs, defendants feel pressure to settle for less than the cost of litigation, lining the pockets of trolls. Such activities in the aggregate have proven very profitable for trolls, and expensive for defendants.</p>
        <p id="auto_b37e26c5-d248-4989-8619-c36579b1218b_eip-365">Spurred by target companies, the America Invents Act legislation in 2011 (see infra, Section X.3.3) included a change in rules governing the joinder of parties, stating:    </p>

        &#x201C;...accused infringers may not be joined in one action as defendants or counterclaim defendants, or have their actions consolidated for trial, based solely on allegations that they each have infringed the patent or patents in suit.&#x201D;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p id="auto_b37e26c5-d248-4989-8619-c36579b1218b_eip-759" class="has-noteref">This eliminated a tool of trolls&#x2014;namely, filing a single case against scores or even hundreds of alleged infringers.<a href="#auto_b37e26c5-d248-4989-8619-c36579b1218b_footnote74" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">lxxiii</a>

      And then Chief Judge Rader of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals coauthored an op-ed piece in the
      <em data-effect="italics">New York Times</em>, recommending that judges should use 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;285 to foil patent trolls by imposing costs and sanctions at the judicial level.<a href="#auto_b37e26c5-d248-4989-8619-c36579b1218b_footnote78" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">lxxvii</a>
      But again, not everyone thinks that is realistic.<a href="#auto_b37e26c5-d248-4989-8619-c36579b1218b_footnote79" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">lxxviii</a>
      The Supreme Court embraced Judge Rader&#x2019;s recommendation in its 2014 decisions in
      <em data-effect="italics">Octane Fitness</em>
      and
      <em data-effect="italics">Highmark</em>, significantly broadening the district court&#x2019;s discretion in finding a case exceptional and awarding attorneys&#x2019; fees. (See
      <em data-effect="italics">supra</em>, Section 2.7, &#x201C;Exceptional Case.&#x201D;) But even with such expanded discretion and power, trial judges cannot rule on the merits of a case without some basis for it, and that requires money spent by defendants. Thus, it is not
      easy for a district court judge to stop what trolls rely upon, namely the use of litigation expense and leverage to extract settlements. Getting to the merits of the claims takes time and significant expense&#x2014;often more than the cost to settle, with
      no assurance as to outcome.</p>

      experts believe that the state and federal actions already taken to rein in abusive patent litigation&#x2014;including important U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 2015 regarding software patentability and fee-shifting in exceptional cases&#x2014;make it less likely
      that new legislation will be introduced any time soon.</p>

      District of Texas, one of the most popular venues for patent litigation in the United States, has added a new Track B docket, which specifically addresses a number of proposals considered by Congress, including early disclosure of certain
