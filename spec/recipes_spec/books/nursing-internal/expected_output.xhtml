Unfolding case studies based on real-world experiences were one of the most requested additions to the text. The key manner in which the vision of <strong>effect="italics"&gt;Fundamentals of Nursing: Concepts and Skills for Patient-Centered Care</strong> will be achieved includes incorporating activities that will be geared toward different learning styles and will include an andragogical approach to take advantage of the adult learners&#x2019; experiences and to achieve full student engagement. Incorporating new technologies throughout the chapters will bring the text in-line with current trends as well as provide new material not currently in most market competitors. Educators suggested adding critical thinking prompts to address clinical judgment and the new NGN requirements. Based on recommendations from over 50% of educators surveyed, sample questions and activities will be added throughout each chapter that will stimulate thought processes around the clinical judgment measurement model (recognition, analysis, hypothesis, generation, implementation, and evaluation). Educators also reported not covering topics such as family nursing, developmental theories, complementary and alternative therapies, concepts of pharmacology, and community-based health care, as well as content covering care of the surgical patient. This is primarily due to time restrictions within the semester and relevance to the course. Therefore, our approach to address these concerns shall be to provide information on these topics in one chapter at the end of the respective units&#x2014;with the exception of concepts covering surgical care, which will be included in the <strong>effect="italics"&gt;Medical-Surgical</strong> text. An additional area addressed in the survey is activities and ancillary materials. Educators noted these items are used for various purposes; because they are not often reliable, however, they may not be graded or used consistently. These supplemental activities would be used if they were high quality, accurate, and cost effective. Therefore, we shall pair the activities with practice NCLEX questions throughout each chapter to encourage critical thinking skills and stimulate clinical judgment. </p>

Recognizing that clinical skills nursing objectives are designed to prepare student nursing with a foundation for nursing, most educators rated their current textbook as weak in the areas of developing clinical judgment and critical thinking skills and preparing students for the new NGN. Unfolding case studies based on real-world experiences are one of the most requested additions to the text. Instructors also noted that the lack of diversity and inclusion is a weakness in their current texts. They would be more likely to adopt a text that better represented the population of patients today&#x2019;s nurses are likely to serve. To address these recommendations, the vision of Clinical Skills in Nursing: A Competency-Based Approach to Patient-Centered Care will be achieved by incorporating activities geared toward different learning styles and adopting an andragogical approach that speaks to adult learners&#x2019; experiences and fully engages students. Educators stated a desire to include more content that is based on current trends at a much more in-depth level. Incorporating new technologies throughout the chapters will align the text to current trends as well as provide new material not currently in most market competitors. Educators suggested adding critical thinking prompts to address clinical judgment and the Next-Generation NCLEX requirements. Based on recommendations from more than 50 percent of educators surveyed, sample questions and activities will be added throughout each chapter to stimulate thought processes around the clinical judgment measurement model (recognition, analysis, hypothesis, generation, implementation, and evaluation). </p>
          <p id="auto_87219488-11fe-4b5a-bdbc-45434a4269a2_para-00002">Educators also reported not covering topics such as drug calculation, IV therapy management, and tracheostomy care and suctioning due to limitations to time or the topics&#x2019; relevance to the course. Therefore, we plan to provide information on these topics in one chapter at the end of the respective unit. An additional area addressed in the survey is activities and ancillary materials. Educators noted these items are used for various purposes but are not often reliable. As a result, these items are not graded or used consistently. Educators would use these supplemental materials if they were high quality, accurate, and cost-effective.

Activities based on real case-studies from inpatient mental health patients will be used (names redacted) to allow students to practice a &#x201C;day in the life of&#x201D; skills needed for psychiatric-mental health nursing. Survey participants (educators) also shared that, most often, content related to sexual dysfunction, gender identity disorders, paraphilias, sleep-wake disorders, forensic nursing, and complementary and alternative therapies are not covered in the psychiatric-mental health course. This is primarily due to time restrictions within the semester and the length of the text. Therefore, our approach to address this is to provide information on these topics in one chapter at the end of the respective units.

Each feature box contains either a link to a deeper exploration of the topic at hand or critical thinking questions that may be geared toward class discussion, student projects, or written essays. Our features include:</p>
          <ul id="auto_87219488-11fe-4b5a-bdbc-45434a4269a2_fs-id1163975475098" data-bullet-style="none">
            <li><strong>Making Connections.Unfolding Case Study. </strong>The Next Generation NCLEX (NGN) will measure nursing candidates&#x2019; clinical judgment ability using case-based scenarios. Unfolding case study features will follow one patient care story through a unit of the book. In the units that contain the case study, the first chapter will provide information from the initial patient encounter in the first module. As the content progresses in the chapters within the unit, the case study will unfold, offering more information about the patient with each box. </li>
            <li><strong>Real RN Stories.</strong> These vignettes should come from actual nurses who faced a problem the students are learning about in that section or chapter. They should not be fictional stories that read like real stories. Hearing a story about a topic makes it real for the learners and helps them unlock concepts and make connections in a way that mere descriptions cannot. </li>
            <li><strong> Life-stage and Cultural Contexts.</strong> These features will highlight age or cultural considerations as they relate to specific skills or topics. For example, age might affect the steps a nurse takes to bathe a neonatal patient as compared to an older child or adult. Cultural differences, such as skin tone or hair texture, may affect the way certain conditions or symptoms present or impact the steps a nurse takes. These boxes help students pay attention to these differences and explain how they may impact their approach to patient care. </li>
            <li><strong>
Clinical Safety and Procedures (QSEN).</strong> The Clinical Safety and Procedure features will present students with step-by-step procedures in specific clinical settings to ensure proper protocols are followed and safety remains a focus. These features can come in many forms (often accompanied by useful diagrams or images) and with largely formulaic instructions for students on topics related to the surrounding textbook content.</li>
            <li><strong>
Clinical Judgment Measurement Model.</strong> These features will focus on one of the six steps in the CJMM. These boxes help students make connections between nursing concepts and/or clinical findings and the steps of the CJMM.</li>
            <li><strong>
Link to Learning.</strong> This feature includes a few sentences of introduction to a website with an interactive activity, animation, video, or primary source that helps improve student understanding.

In the 14th century, Mansa Musa&#x2019;s Malian kingdom was the most recent state in the history of the African Sahel to exploit the region&#x2019;s incredibly vast gold fields, having been preceded by the kingdom of Ghana (dubbed the &#x201C;Land of Gold&#x201D; by medieval Arab traders) and, in turn, succeeded by the Songhai kingdom. From their position astride the Sahelian trade routes, these centralized medieval African states exercised enormous influence over Trans-Saharan Trade, a system of exchange which connected West African gold with the economies of North Africa, the Middle East, southern Europe, and beyond.</p>

To avoid errors and inaccuracies in the diagnosis and treatment of a patient, it is imperative an accurate health history be obtained. While the health history is primarily used to better serve an individual patient, the information or data collected can have many other functions. Some of these functions include defining the medical facilities services, guiding future facility growth, and establishing trends in current practice.  This chapter discusses the processes involved in obtaining a complete health history, data collection and documentation involved in a health history, and informatics.  WW-test notes this opener is 298 words.</p>

As small clusters of Bantu-speakers advanced into modern Kenya and Tanzania, nuclei of interlacustrine Bantu turned toward Congo, while other groups pushed southward, in the direction of southern East Africa. By the third or fourth century B.C.E., Bantu-speaking communities stretched from the extreme southern reaches of Somalia in the north to Mozambique in the south. </p>

Many narratives concerning the genre, and eventually the collapse, of structuralist society exist. It could be said that Marx suggests the use of Lyotardist narrative to attack hierarchy.

This is the description of &#x201C;Clinical Judgment Measurement Model&#x201D; FB from the WEG: 1&#x2013;3 per chapter; 1&#x2013;5 paragraphs. These features will focus on one of the six steps in the CJMM. The box title should begin with the step name followed by a specific title that reflects the content. These boxes help students make connections between nursing concepts and/or clinical findings and the steps of the CJMM. For example, when discussing a specific cardiovascular symptom/condition, a CJMM Feature Box might focus on the Take Action step of the CJMM and discuss possible nursing interventions associated with the specific symptom/disorder.</p>

These following are the skills with examples related to psychopharmacology. A nurse is working in a clinic with patients diagnosed with serious mental illness.  Patient X, a 57-year-old presents to the clinic two days after receiving a being converted from risperidone PO to Risperdal Consta injection.  The patient is complaining of muscle stiffness, sore jaw, sore neck, they are unable to close their mouth.  The patient&#x2019;s eyes are rolling back into their head.  They are having difficulty talking.</p>

                  <li>Recognize Cues: Gather information such as medication history, signs, symptoms, health history, etc.</li>
                  <li>Analyze Cues: How does the client history and signs/symptoms relate to the client presentation and the client&#x2019;s needs or concerns?</li>
                  <li>Prioritize Hypotheses: Establish priorities based on the client&#x2019;s needs or problems. The priority is the side effects from the antipsychotic medication. The patient recently had a change to the dosing of his medication that may have contributed to his current symptoms.</li>
                  <li>Generate Solutions: Identify outcomes and nursing interventions to meet the client&#x2019;s needs or address the problems. </li>
                  <li>Expected Outcome: reduction in the adverse events related to the lorem ipsum.</li>
                  <li>Nursing Interventions: Assess for EPS using scale, take vital signs, notify provider, administer medications as needed, monitor client per agency policy, evaluate the effects of the medications by reassessing the client one hour post administration.</li>
                  <li>Take Action: Implement the interventions, priorities of care, and planned outcomes to promote, maintain, or restore the client's health. Perform the nursing actions based on priority. Collaborate with other members of the health care team and participate in coordination of care by implementing the plan of care, documenting care, giving/receiving report, assisting with rounding, educating the client, etc.</li>
                  <li>Evaluate Outcomes: Gauge the client's response to the interventions to see if the outcomes have been met. If met, continue to monitor. If not met, gather more information and/or revise the plan of care. One hour post medication administration, the client is now able to move mouth without soreness, able to talk, no muscle stiffness or soreness after injection.</li>

The embryonic nature of the early Iron Age Bantu economy necessitated an emphasis on self-sufficiency with little potential for trade, although evidence exists that communities engaged in some small-scale trade, particularly of sought-after commodities like copper and salt in regions of the Congo and Tanzania. </p>

What makes people change or act? For much of history, the answer lay for most historians in the actions of elites&#x2014;Caesars, kings, and queens. This seemed natural in a world where the king&#x2019;s choice became everyone&#x2019;s choice and where sources rarely spoke about anyone other than noble lords and ladies.

Thomas Carlyle, a nineteenth century historian, considered the study of the lives of &#x201C;big men&#x201D; as enough to understand all of history. Higher education was the prevue of the rich; it must have seemed quite natural believe that only the elites could move history. </p>

What makes people change or act? For much of history, the answer lay for most historians in the actions of elites&#x2014;Caesars, kings, and queens. This seemed natural in a world where the king&#x2019;s choice became everyone&#x2019;s choice and where sources rarely spoke about anyone other than noble lords and ladies.

                <p id="auto_ac0ccc4a-cba7-4346-9995-f09a0ac8ca8a_para-00025">If one examines Lyotardist narrative, one is faced with a choice: either reject prestructuralist nationalism or conclude that the significance of the participant is significant form. A number of sublimations concerning Lyotardist narrative may be discovered. &#x201C;Society is part of the absurdity of reality,&#x201D; says Foucault. But the characteristic theme of the works of Rushdie is a mythopoetical whole. Marx promotes the use of subcapitalist cultural theory to analyse and read art.</p>
                <p id="auto_ac0ccc4a-cba7-4346-9995-f09a0ac8ca8a_para-00026">The main theme of Parry&#x2019;s analysis of postconceptualist dialectic theory is the role of the observer as participant. However, the subject is interpolated into a Lyotardist narrative that includes narrativity as a reality. The characteristic theme of the works of Rushdie is the difference between society and sexual identity.</p>
                <p id="auto_ac0ccc4a-cba7-4346-9995-f09a0ac8ca8a_para-00027">It could be said that the subject is contextualised into a subcapitalist cultural theory that includes truth as a whole. Lyotard suggests the use of prestructuralist nationalism to deconstruct the status quo.But if Lyotardist narrative holds, we have to choose between Foucaultist power relations and precapitalist construction. Bataille promotes the use of subcapitalist cultural theory to analyse art.</p>
                <p id="auto_ac0ccc4a-cba7-4346-9995-f09a0ac8ca8a_para-00028">Thus, Baudrillard uses the term &#x2018;Lyotardist narrative&#x2019; to denote not deappropriation, as subcapitalist cultural theory suggests, but subdeappropriation. The subject is interpolated into a prestructuralist nationalism that includes consciousness as a totality. WW-test table with art in feature box.</p>

According to tradition, this patriarch had the power of life and death over all his dependents, an authority referred to as <em data-effect="italics">patria potestas</em>. Members of the extended family subject to this authority included the patriarch&#x2019;s wife, children, anyone descended through the family&#x2019;s male line, and all slaves belonging to the household. With his authority, the patriarch was both the judge and rule maker of the family, with the power to sell his dependents into bondage or destroy their property.</p>

Though more elite families could afford private tutors, education for Romans usually centered on reading and writing Latin and Greek as well as arithmetic. Around age fifteen, boys would don the <em data-effect="italics">toga virilis</em> (&#x201C;toga of manhood&#x201D;), a plain white toga representing their enrollment as citizens and entrance into manhood. Sons of prominent families could then go on to a civil or military career. Since men would eventually inherit their fathers&#x2019; property (as well as their debts), they were compelled to continue their family&#x2019;s prosperity.</p>

            <p id="auto_ac0ccc4a-cba7-4346-9995-f09a0ac8ca8a_eip-959">In the twentieth century, particularly after the First World War, the idea of human progress must have seemed laughable. Beginning with the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, the world was plunged into war and the events that followed were horrifically absurd. All of the modern inventions and the spread of democratic institutions did not stop the bloody hell of trench warfare. People were more willing to question the authority of elites and religious leaders as they could be of little help once war began. Historians became more interested in the irrational aspects of the human condition, the psychology behind one&#x2019;s choices. </p>
            <p id="auto_ac0ccc4a-cba7-4346-9995-f09a0ac8ca8a_eip-606">The counterculture of the 1960s deepened the desire to challenge existing norms. As students protested the Viet Nam war, the lack of Civil Rights, and the closed-mindedness of the previous generation, young historians developed new ideas. In their 1966 book, <em data-effect="italics">The Social Construction of Reality</em>, Peter Burger and Thomas Luckman argued our belief systems are informed by social constructs, the way society tells us to think and behave. Consider our first thought exercise. You believe education is important. Why? Who has said that to you in the past? How did you come to believe it? These constructs exist everywhere and they inform many decisions that we make, often on a subconscious level.  </p>
            <p id="auto_ac0ccc4a-cba7-4346-9995-f09a0ac8ca8a_eip-185">Evaluation is a critical part of any project. This involves having measures in place so you can evaluate what you have done. For example, if you want to develop an entrepreneurial vision in the next 3 months, then you should have some goals that relate to how much of the vision should be completed in week 1, week 2, week 3 and so on. Measuring your progress against your plan can keep you on track with the end goal in mind. </p>

Clients formed a largely educated class in Rome who supported themselves through the benefaction of their patrons and more meager employment. Though Romans typically had a six-hour workday, the urban poor relied more on occasional work or odd jobs. In large cities, many lived in insulae (sing. insula), large apartment complexes of three to four levels that occupied a rectangular block in a city. Insulae had a bad reputation, however, for being overcrowded and having limited facilities. Professions outside of the law and military were generally held by freedmen (a class of emancipated slaves) who worked in trade, agriculture, and education. Recall that you learned about this concept in the discussion on <a href="#page_c971e761-ee53-4607-8046-54a7cc33d194">Foundations for Accurate Health History</a> and how it impacted political life in that era.

There are many different methods that can work, and you should choose the one that best suits your situation. If that method is not productive, of course you should try another. Remember, entrepreneurial visions are not made overnight, but with time and effort, you will refine your vision to best match your entrepreneurial goals and objectives.

            <p id="auto_ac0ccc4a-cba7-4346-9995-f09a0ac8ca8a_para-00052">In this section we looked at the importance of the entrepreneurial mindset. This way of thinking can energize and motivate the entrepreneur to take their business to the next level. It is a learned behavior that can be adopted by any business founder who wants to continually improve their business. In the same way, entrepreneurial spirit is a key part of the start-up business. This is a forward thinking, problem solving, can-do approach to running the business. These two aspects of the business are reinforced by the entrepreneur&#x2019;s passion. This internal drive will keep the individual going when things get tough, because their passion will carry them on to the next thing. Passion sustains the entrepreneur because it speaks to the core of what they do and why they do it.</p>

            <p id="auto_4ef7a7af-cf69-4c1f-8d57-34805483404d_para-00011">In this section we have seen examples of the entrepreneurial mindset, and how it can be a positive influence on entrepreneurs everywhere. Some of these business start-ups are the result of collaborative efforts of multi-disciplinary teams, where individuals from different disciplines come together to create items that they could not have created alone. We have also looked at the global nature of entrepreneurship, and the increasing diversity among entrepreneurs. This has resulted in many more new products and services available to meet consumer needs.</p>

                <p>&#x201C;My most humble duty remembered to you, hoping in god of your good health, as I myself am at the making hereof. This is to let you understand that I you child am in a most heavy case by reason of the country, [which] is such that it causeth much sickness, [such] as the scurvy and the bloody flux and diverse other diseases, which maketh the body very poor and weak. . . .</p>
                <p>And I have nothing to comfort me, nor is there nothing to be gotten here but sickness and death, except [in the event] that one had money to lay out in some things for profit. . . .</p>
                <p>[Mr. Jackson] much marvelled that you would send me a servant to the Company; he saith I had been better knocked on the head. And indeed so I find it now, to my great grief and misery; and [I] saith that if you love me you will redeem me suddenly, for which I do entreat and beg. And if you cannot get the merchants to redeem me for some little money, then for God&#x2019;s sake get a gathering or entreat some good folks to lay out some little sum of money in meal and cheese and butter and beef. Any eating meat will yield great profit.&#x201D;</p>
