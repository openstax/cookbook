<p id="auto_4c5a8f6b-1855-4d3b-a8f9-e0af616b62b9_fs-idm209850016"><em data-effect="italics">Business Computer Applications</em> is designed to support a semester-length, 16-week course offered at both two-year and four-year institutions. Students taking courses likely to adopt this textbook are presumed to have little to no computer experience and are enrolled in business-related or introductory computer and computer-literacy courses. The textbook covers both hard and soft skills that are applicable to a broad range of both entry-level and professional careers. </p>
<section data-depth="2" id="auto_4c5a8f6b-1855-4d3b-a8f9-e0af616b62b9_fs-idm184050896"><h4 data-type="title">Coverage and scope</h4>
<p id="auto_4c5a8f6b-1855-4d3b-a8f9-e0af616b62b9_fs-idm183967136">The <em data-effect="italics">Business Computer Applications</em> resource consists of 15 chapters providing comprehensive coverage for a single-semester course that teaches business students and those preparing for the workforce to the typical software programs and skills they will need. The textbook begins with two introductory chapters spanning technology use in everyday life and business, as well as hardware, software, and the cloud. The inclusion of these chapters is intentional, as reviewers noted they cannot ensure students possess this pre-existing knowledge. While there is a possibility these chapters will not be used in full within a course sequence, portions of each will, and students can refer to this material to close any gaps in their pre-existing knowledge. This is an intentional decision to align with equity and inclusion practices. It is worth noting that while security and ethics are specifically defined in Chapter 2, these topics will be carried across the full resource within chapter content and within assessments across the textbook. </p>
<p id="auto_4c5a8f6b-1855-4d3b-a8f9-e0af616b62b9_fs-idm191601056">Also noteworthy is the presence of a cross-chapter business scenario that carries across chapters. This affords deeper insight into the business use of each application singularly and collectively within a holistic approach simulating what students are likely to encounter in the workplace. Furthermore, most workplace settings encounter cross-suite use to some degree, whether internally or in collaboration with clients. Practice across the two main business suites is necessary to ensuring preparation for present and future work requirements. Database systems, such as Access, are introduced with a newer approach than used in past traditional market titles, based on peer review feedback. As most businesses utilize proprietary database systems in their organizations, the basic foundation of relational databases remains the same and learning one with a focus on transfer of skills will be reinforced across the two database chapters. Coverage of Content Management Systems and Social Media is added in alignment with peer review feedback and is forward thinking in serving modern business needs.</p>

<p id="auto_4c5a8f6b-1855-4d3b-a8f9-e0af616b62b9_fs-idm203325648">To thrive in today’s business climate, students must acquire key skills to be agile and succeed as creators of or responders to disruption. They must be proficient in change management and data literacy and be able to analyze and lead with a global cultural perspective that embraces diversity, equity, and inclusion. In addition to strong business acumen and computer application proficiency, skills in communication, critical thinking, collaboration, and ethical business practice are essential to creating responsible professionals in business. Achieving this requires an authentic learning experience that reinforces transfer of skills to real-world scenarios relevant to today’s business environment. The <em data-effect="italics">Business Computer Applications</em> textbook combines studio learning and guided practice with scaffolded activities designed to reinforce a student’s ability to perform higher-order tasks independently.</p></section>

The early computers were developed to essentially be “data crunchers.” You might be surprised to discover that the origins of computers date back to the 1800s in France. Joseph Marie Jacquard developed a machine to automatically weave designs in fabric using a punch card system (<a href="#auto_abdf9b63-540d-4bb0-8b73-dd2be052d616_figure_BCA_01_01_Theory" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). This punch card system laid the foundation for more advancements in number calculations for the 1880 census in the United States developed by the future founder of IBM, Herman Hollerith. IBM was founded in 1924 as Hollerith continued to improve upon the initial punch card system.

This machine was motor-driven, programmable, and contained many of the internal components that are still used today. This unit weighed over 2,000 lbs.! The Z1 paved the way for other inventors to make their mark on the new concept. At the same time, the Z1 was being developed, Hewlett-Packard emerged from a garage workspace and was founded in 1939. David Packard and Bill Hewlett worked out of a garage in California and initially worked on developing equipment for engineers. Between the years of 1940-1955 several scientists and innovators created advancements towards making the computers we use today. </p><p id="auto_abdf9b63-540d-4bb0-8b73-dd2be052d616_eip-235">Most notable was the 1943 invention of the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator) built by two professors at the University of Pennsylvania. This massive unit used vacuum tubes and shifted the architecture of computers away from mechanical processes. It is considered the forerunner for the digital computers of today. Other innovations included things like solving equations simultaneously, the invention of the transistor, and the development of the <span data-type="term">computer language</span>. The computer language was developed by computer scientist Grace <span data-type="term">Hopper</span> to use words instead of numbers in programming. She was a pioneer in her field not only because of her contributions, but also because she was a female mathematician and United States Navy Admiral which was unusual for the time.

Some key impacts to the workplace include:</p><ul id="auto_abdf9b63-540d-4bb0-8b73-dd2be052d616_eip-743"><li>Improved efficiency and productivity</li>
<li>Reduction of errors</li>

</ul><p id="auto_abdf9b63-540d-4bb0-8b73-dd2be052d616_eip-977">These computing machines along with the emergence and subsequent explosion of the internet, have forever transformed both our work and home lives.
</p><p id="auto_abdf9b63-540d-4bb0-8b73-dd2be052d616_eip-344">One such computer was brought to the market by Xerox. This revolutionary machine, the Xerox Alto, had the ability to not only act as a calculator, but could print documents and send emails. The machine also included a screen, mouse, and keyboard. These early personal computers set the stage for the quick expansion of computing in the workplace. </p><p id="auto_abdf9b63-540d-4bb0-8b73-dd2be052d616_eip-951">Two key players in the personal computer market emerged during the 1970s. In 1975, Paul Allen and Bill <span data-type="term">Gates</span> founded <span data-type="term">Microsoft</span> to focus on software for the new computers. Then in 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak found <span data-type="term">Apple</span>. With the founding of Apple, the Apple I computer with a single circuit board emerged on the market. By 1980 the computing capabilities had expanded to include color graphics, spreadsheets, and word processing programs. The market competition between Microsoft, HP, IBM, Apple, and others accelerated the technological advancements and shaped the industry and our society. In fact, in 1982, People Magazine named the computer as the “Machine of the Year” instead of their traditional “Man of the Year” recognition. Since the 1980s, computers have evolved into laptops, cellphones, and other similar devices.

Computers were first used in the workplace in the 1950s. Their use at that time was for scientific and engineering applications. They were designed to be calculating machines to facilitate data analysis. In 1964, Programma 101, an Italian desktop-sized programmable calculator was the first commercially viable product to hit the market. It was heavy and expensive (about the cost of one month’s commercial property rent at the time). So, although Programma 101 and a few others were commercially available in the 1960s, it really was not until 1975 that computers took a prominent position in the workplace. Prior to this time, only large corporations and research institutions had the space and resources to utilize the computers that were commercially available. The development of the <span data-type="term">microcomputer</span> changed the face of the industry. This was prompted by the invention of the microchip by Intel in 1970 that was quickly followed by the floppy disk developed by IBM engineers and ethernet connection capability by Xerox. By 1980, there were several microcomputers/personal computers (<a href="#auto_abdf9b63-540d-4bb0-8b73-dd2be052d616_figure_BCA_01_01_FemSupport" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) on the market that brought computing into even the small business industry.

</figure><p id="auto_abdf9b63-540d-4bb0-8b73-dd2be052d616_eip-153">Almost in parallel to the evolution of computing in the workplace, computers migrated into individual’s homes. In the early 80s personal computers (PCs) were made available to the average consumer through outlets such as Sears and Radio Shack. In 1981, IBM introduced Acorn, which included Microsoft software and an Intel <span data-type="term">microchip</span>. Soon to follow was Apple’s MacIntosh computer. Many of these new designs were streamlined and simple to use for the whole family. Also, the price point for the computers made them more attainable for the consumer with most priced well below $2,000 (but still an expensive investment for that time).
</p><p id="auto_abdf9b63-540d-4bb0-8b73-dd2be052d616_eip-36">Initially these home computers were centered on gaming and entertainment. Even with rudimentary graphics and text-based games, the trend quickly caught on. Commonly played games such as chess were translated into the computer environment. These games allowed the user to experience the computer’s capabilities beyond the workplace. Tandy (Radio Shack) introduced a new computer that was much cheaper and included new features such as cassette disk storage and programming capability. The TRS-80 microcomputer sold for less than $400 and added to the competition in the industry. The computer was so successful that a newer version was developed and introduced to the market just two years later. Commodore introduced the C64 in 1982 and it still holds the record for as the highest selling computer model in the world. Tandy would later follow with the Tandy 1000 that was marketed directly to the home consumer. It is interesting to note that Tandy kept all manufacturing in the United States. Many of its competitors shifted manufacturing overseas to reduce costs and that enabled the computers to be more affordable to the average consumer.

By the mid to late 1980s the market continued to grow, and manufacturing costs decreased with the increased innovations in the industry. Computers evolved into home workstations with capabilities beyond gaming. But the trend beyond entertainment seemed slow to catch on. Many home users did not see the value in owning a personal computer. In 1987, less than 20% of the homes owned a computer. With the expansion of the internet and improved interfaces that were less technical for the average user, the industry exploded in the late 90s and early 2000s. Apple introduced customizable products during this time that allowed the buyer to select casing color schemes. Home workstations became the place to keep family finances, recipes, word processors for school research reports, and a connection to friends and family through email. In 1999 the term “Wi-Fi” was coined as more users began to connect to the internet without wires. Since 2000, the warp speed of innovations has brought to the market things such as laptops weighing less than 3 lbs., new operating systems, web browsers and social networking sites, and quantum computers. Many of today’s home computing devices are laptops that are less than 1 inch thick, equipped with high-speed connectivity, stellar graphics, and touchscreen capabilities.

The computerized nature of most cars today has prompted those in the industry to think broadly about how to make roads and people safer. One such innovation is cross communication between vehicles, also known as vehicle-to-vehicle communication. This would allow cars to wirelessly communicate with each information such as speed, spatial proximity to other cars and/or objects, and traffic congestion issues. This has the potential to reduce traffic crashes and congestion on highways. Currently, researchers are working to find a solution to incorporate this technology broadly to have the greatest impact to safety. Another innovation targeted to increasing safety are air bags that can protect cars in collisions. The auto industry is working to balance the aesthetic needs of the consumer while increasing safety standards. Outside of car design, we recently we have seen an increase in the number of nontraditional car dealers such as Carvana that offer an online purchase experience and home delivery. The use of technology in the auto industry can be seen at all stages of the business cycle.

Most practices (even smaller offices) and hospitals utilize electronic medical records. These records have increased the efficiency and accuracy of record management and have also increased the transparency of information to patients, families, and their care providers. For some time now, robotics and computerized systems have been used in existing surgical procedures. Nanotechnologies have enabled doctors to pioneer new treatments and surgeries that once seemed impossible. More recently we have more options for telehealth or virtual healthcare options. These options have reduced many barriers (including some financial barriers) for those needing care for a wide variety of needs including mental health issues, child illness, or support for caring for elderly loved ones. Having this virtual option has not only added convenience, but has also improved communication between patient and provider, increased speed of care, and has allowed patients to take a much more informed and greater role in their healthcare needs, as shown in <a href="#auto_abdf9b63-540d-4bb0-8b73-dd2be052d616_figure_BCA_01_01_LaborForce" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.

For example, headers usually contain the document title and logo, which identify the business. And footers commonly contain a business and/or author’s name, which are important when it comes to protecting the copyright and contents of the document. Also, the page numbers provide reference points for readers when cross-referencing information, and should readers print the plan, they will know the order of each page by the page numbers, should pages get separated. Lastly, footers may contain version numbers or dates, which can be important when determining if the document is the most recent version.

To fully embrace the study of the past, the student of history must be able to set aside the assumptions of the modern era. It is not the historian’s job to pass judgment on the past but present it as clearly as possible and to preserve that picture for future generations. The more strands that we can investigate and bring together, the more accurate the picture will be. And there is still much work to be done. For example, recent research into areas of LGQBT studies, indigenous studies, and the global south will continue to sharpen the image of the past. The bottom line is that interpretation has a central role in the history of history (<a href="#auto_abdf9b63-540d-4bb0-8b73-dd2be052d616_figure_BCA_01_01_Telework" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). And interpretative changes increase the number of ways we can use to get a clearer picture of those who lived before us. The danger lies in using only one lens. If you elevate one over all of the others, your picture of the past is less clear.</p>

The embryonic nature of the early Iron Age Bantu economy necessitated an emphasis on self-sufficiency with little potential for trade, although evidence exists that communities engaged in some small-scale trade, particularly of sought-after commodities like copper and salt in regions of the Congo and Tanzania.

The city of Rome gave its name to an empire that stretched from Britain to the Arabian Peninsula. The vast geographic expanse of the empire was reflected in the diversity of the experiences of those living within it. While political life was centered in the city of Rome – the seat of the Senate and the emperor – the daily lives of people across the empire varied greatly. </p>

<p id="auto_8624d898-718e-4a61-a5c8-e57cf2745c0c_fs-idm248265696">Rome was a <span data-type="term">patriarchal society</span> that achieved success through military dominance, patriotism, and the dispensation of authority. This arrangement largely benefited upper class Roman men, while others struggled to navigate the system and were subject to elite dominance. Roman women and enslaved people were held to restrictive cultural standards on their behavior, though many were able to overcome these to hold real influence in Roman society. The complexity of daily life in Rome is key to understanding how the empire functioned and flourished at its height. WW-TEST notes that this module is testing some art issues (art against feature box shaded backgrounds, PNG art), tables, and lists.

This system relies on maintaining accurate records and requires an information system that supports accurate documentation. When the material is requested for production, a materials requisition slip is completed and shows the exact items and quantity requested along with the associated cost. The completed form is signed by the requestor and approved by the manager responsible for the budget.

In the last four decades, wages in the United States have not kept up with productivity. According to the Economic Policy Institute, from 1948 to 1973, hourly compensation rose 91 percent, which closely follows productivity gains of 97 percent. However, from 1973 to 2013, hourly compensation rose only 9 percent, whereas productivity rose 74 percent in the same period.

It was not until the early centuries of the Common Era that the western stream penetrated Angola in the far southern extreme of West Africa.

What makes people change or act? For much of history, the answer lay for most historians in the actions of elites—Caesars, kings, and queens. This seemed natural in a world where the king’s choice became everyone’s choice and where sources rarely spoke about anyone other than noble lords and ladies.

Family life was oriented around the paterfamilias, the male head of the household. According to tradition, this patriarch had the power of life and death over all his dependents, an authority referred to as patria potestas. Members of the extended family subject to this authority included the patriarch’s wife, children, anyone descended through the family’s male line, and all slaves belonging to the household. With his authority, the patriarch was both the judge and rule maker of the family, with the power to sell his dependents into bondage or destroy their property.

Despite these extreme powers, the goal of the paterfamilias was to promote his family’s welfare. Ultimately, a father’s power worked through consensus and deliberation with the other members of the family.

<p id="auto_8624d898-718e-4a61-a5c8-e57cf2745c0c_eip-idm380064640">
In early Rome, children were educated in the home; later, grammar schools enrolled boys and girls from wealthy families until around the age of twelve. Though more elite families could afford private tutors, education for Romans usually centered on reading and writing Latin and Greek as well as arithmetic. Around age fifteen, boys would don the toga virilis (“toga of manhood”), a plain white toga representing their enrollment as citizens and entrance into manhood. Sons of prominent families could then go on to a civil or military career. Since men would eventually inherit their fathers’ property (as well as their debts), they were compelled to continue their family’s prosperity.
</p>
<p id="auto_8624d898-718e-4a61-a5c8-e57cf2745c0c_eip-idm376728544">By contrast, girls commonly married at a young age, most between fourteen and eighteen years old, and often to much older men. In the most common form of marriage, a wife entered a marriage with a dowry that became the husband’s property. Thus, a woman from a wealthy background with a large dowry had some sway in making marriage arrangements. But less well-off women were more reliant on their husbands’ status. In any case, marriage represented a woman coming under the legal control of her husband’s household.
</p>
<p id="auto_8624d898-718e-4a61-a5c8-e57cf2745c0c_eip-idm382695792">
This vast legal and age imbalance between husband and wife resonates with the cultural restrictions on Roman women (<a href="#auto_8624d898-718e-4a61-a5c8-e57cf2745c0c_eip-figure-01-02-TCommBen" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Women were responsible for the management of the household, including ensuring provisions for the family, overseeing the slaves and other dependents, and looking after the children. Spinning wool was viewed as the activity of an ideal Roman woman, and many wives were expected to occupy themselves with this work. Despite these expectations, there is evidence that many women held professions outside the home, including in medicine, trade, and agriculture. </p>

<p id="auto_8624d898-718e-4a61-a5c8-e57cf2745c0c_fs-idm382084752">Romans lived and worked in a variety of contexts across the empire. Most of our evidence for understanding the practical elements of Roman daily life comes from archaeological evidence at Pompeii. This bustling Italian city shows us the occupations, architecture, and lifestyles of different social classes. In addition, though most of our evidence concerns wealthy estates, life outside the city in the countryside was an important part of Roman society.

</p>

<p id="auto_8624d898-718e-4a61-a5c8-e57cf2745c0c_fs-idm380108304">Daily life was dominated by aristocratic men who enjoyed careers in politics, law, and the military. Social relationships centered on these upper-class patrons and their clients; every morning patrons would receive a number of clients in their homes seeking aid in exchange for loyalty. Afterward, a man’s late morning usually involved responsibilities outside the home including business and political meetings. During the afternoon, wealthy Roman men would spend their time socializing and pursuing leisure activities, such as attending public entertainment performances or visiting the bathhouse.</p>

Beginning with the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, the world was plunged into war and the events that followed were horrifically absurd. All of the modern inventions and the spread of democratic institutions did not stop the bloody hell of trench warfare. People were more willing to question the authority of elites and religious leaders as they could be of little help once war began. Historians became more interested in the irrational aspects of the human condition, the psychology behind one’s choices.
</p><p id="auto_8624d898-718e-4a61-a5c8-e57cf2745c0c_eip-607">The counterculture of the 1960s deepened the desire to challenge existing norms. As students protested the Viet Nam war, the lack of Civil Rights, and the closed-mindedness of the previous generation, young historians developed new ideas. In their 1966 book, The Social Construction of Reality, Peter Burger and Thomas Luckman argued our belief systems are informed by social constructs, the way society tells us to think and behave. Consider our first thought exercise. You believe education is important. Why? Who has said that to you in the past? How did you come to believe it? These constructs exist everywhere and they inform many decisions that we make, often on a subconscious level.

Process Costing is the optimal system when the production process is continuous and it is difficult to trace a particular input cost with a specific individual product. Process costing systems assign costs to each department as the costs are incurred. The costs to produce one unit is calculated based on the information from the production departments. The focus of process costing systems is on measuring and assigning the conversion costs to the proper department so the cost of the individual units can be determined.

Let us look at one more example. This time it will be the broader topic of Colonial Latin America, between the Spanish conquest and the independence movements of the 1820s. How would each school of thought approach the topic? The progressive historian might look at the growth of democratic legal systems or the increase in interest in republican forms of government. The intellectual historian might consider the literature and philosophy of the period. The social historian would look at things like what people ate, how they worked, what they looked for in marriage partners. A communist historian would look at issues of unfair labor practices and moments of class conflict like rebellion or riot. The feminist historian would investigate the great power differential that existed in this highly patriarchal society. And the post-colonialist would highlight aspects of colonialism that would remain impactful after independence. All of these interpretative elements help us weave together a more complete picture of the past as will future efforts to enhance our understanding.

Suburban villas were located just outside a city’s walls, and villas located in the countryside typically originated as sites of agriculture. The large estates known as latifundia were agricultural operations in which enslaved people worked the land for the owner’s profit. In the imperial period, these estates came to contain villa residences that functioned more as places of recreation and displaying wealth. Many elements of luxury hinted at in townhouses appear in villas, such as gardens, fountains, and mosaics.

<li>In this section we looked at the importance of the entrepreneurial mindset. This way of thinking can energize and motivate the entrepreneur to take their business to the next level. </li>
<li>It is a learned behavior that can be adopted by any business founder who wants to continually improve their business. In the same way, entrepreneurial spirit is a key part of the start-up business. This is a forward thinking, problem solving, can-do approach to running the business.
</li>
<li>These two aspects of the business are reinforced by the entrepreneur’s passion. This internal drive will keep the individual going when things get tough, because their passion will carry them on to the next thing. Passion sustains the entrepreneur because it speaks to the core of what they do and why they do it.

<p id="auto_d2af13aa-9999-4900-aca8-329915dd4d45_eip-613">PowerPoint is primarily used to accompany a speech. It allows the speaker to express ideas visually, enhance the message, and leave an impression on the audience. You do not need expertise concerning design, color, typeface, or composition, because <span data-type="term">PowerPoint</span>’s built-in themes will provide the foundation and the appropriate format. It can essentially create a slideshow for you. However, in the end, you have complete control over colors, fonts, and all aspects of the design of your slides. The purpose of your presentation will be the leading factor in these decisions. Recall that you learned about this concept in the discussion on <a href="#page_abdf9b63-540d-4bb0-8b73-dd2be052d616">Computing: From Inception to Today</a> and how it impacted political life in that era.

A <span data-type="term">slideshow</span> is an ordered collection of slides, which visually tells a story, conveys business information, introduces new policies, and so on. Each <span data-type="term">slide</span> can be viewed as a container for text, pictures, videos, bullet item lists, WordArt, just about anything.

</p><p id="auto_d2af13aa-9999-4900-aca8-329915dd4d45_eip-897">Let’s start by exploring the PowerPoint interface and learn how to navigate within the program. In many respects, you will find the features of PowerPoint similar to those in the other Office programs. For example, when you first open PowerPoint, you are presented with the initial view, just like in Word and Excel. Down the left column, you can choose whether to start a new project, open a previous project, check your account details, offer feedback to Microsoft, or make changes to the many other options offered, as shown in Figure 06_01_Opening.

In the large area of the window, you will find a list of your previous presentations, if there are any.

There are common components in all of the Office programs, and they are especially useful in creating checklists (<a href="#auto_d2af13aa-9999-4900-aca8-329915dd4d45_eip-figure-01-03-Checklist" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). They include the Title bar at the very top of the window stating the file name and the name of the application. To the right are the controls for minimizing the window, expanding the window to full-screen, and closing the program. On the far left is the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT). While it only contains a few controls, they are important ones. You will likely use the controls in the QAT often, as it includes Save, Undo, and Redo. Have you ever been typing, looked up, and noticed that you were in the wrong paragraph? We are grateful to Microsoft for the Undo command. The QAT also contains the control for customization of itself. Next, we find the ribbon, a band across the top of the workspace containing the primary functions used to create your presentation. This is the control center of the application. All the commands and command groups are located in the ribbon. Each tab generates a different <span data-type="term">ribbon</span> with the appropriate commands and command groups. We will explore some of those tabs in this section, those that are used most often.

Protect Presentation brings up a menu that offers you options for protecting the presentation. Notice that you can choose Always Open Read-Only, which will prevent any accidental editing of your work, or you can encrypt the presentation with a password. You can choose Restrict Access, an option that lets you connect to Information Rights Management (IRM), which also restricts access to the presentation. If you are told to use this feature, instructions are likely available with your supervisor. The other options include adding an invisible digital signature and mark the presentation as final.

obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a
mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy
but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic
liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or
legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.

There are many elements associated with each of the Options menu items, and it would be advantageous to click on each one to see what it covered. One of the Options menu items that is critical to your work is the Save option. It is called Auto Recover, and you can set the program to automatically save your work every 2 minutes, 5 minutes, whatever you choose. Just ask yourself this question, “Has my computer ever froze in the middle of a sentence?” It happens to everyone. Auto Recover can prevent a catastrophe.

As the founder and CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, Shkreli obtained the expired patent for a lifesaving drug used to combat HIV. He raised the U.S. market price overnight from $13.50 to $750.00 per pill—a 5000% increase. When criticism by the medical community, the public, and 2016 presidential candidates led to demands for a return to the original pricing, Shkreli defended his decision as a smart business practice that contributed to his firm’s bottom line. Eventually, he agreed to reverse the price but later reneged on his promise, offering instead to provide discounts to hospitals. Infectious disease specialists and patient advocates rejected Shkreli’s argument that his “price adjustment strategy” was helpful for patients because those being treated would need the drug long after being released from the hospital. Although the pricing strategy was not illegal, Shkreli was investigated and found guilty of securities fraud that involved falsely raising money from hedge-fund investors and stealing money from his drug company to repay investors. WW-test notes that opener is 194 words.

Premier Printing knows that their customers want more options when ordering customized invitations and announcements, but their current equipment has limited capability. New machinery that would meet this demand is available but comes with substantial costs. </p><p id="auto_8d362733-bbeb-4459-8817-a51b2813ffd0_eip-535">In addition to the machinery itself, Premier would have to incur additional costs for specialty ink, paper and binding materials. Their staff would have to receive training in the use of the new equipment and specialized tools for the maintenance of the machine must be purchased. The company will have to update its marketing materials and website to alert customers of its new offerings. Their current facility is limited on space, so there is even some question as to whether they have a physical location for the new equipment. Finally, is the additional revenue they generate worth the cost of expanding their location?
</p><p id="auto_8d362733-bbeb-4459-8817-a51b2813ffd0_eip-107">Despite their desire to meet consumer demand, Premier must analyze the costs associated with this new equipment to determine if the benefits outweigh the costs. Just like a student wanting to purchase a car, Premier must determine which expenses they can cut to be able to afford the equipment. What are the long and short-term costs they will have to absorb? How can they control their expenses to make the acquisition of new equipment possible and profitable? </p><p id="auto_8d362733-bbeb-4459-8817-a51b2813ffd0_eip-826">In this chapter, you will learn the various descriptive labels that businesses attach to costs, how those labels are used by different types of businesses and why those labels are important in the decision-making process. You will also learn <span data-type="term">cost estimation techniques</span> which can aid management in segregating different types of costs. In future chapters, you will learn how to use these various cost labels in the decision-making process. </p>

</div><p id="auto_8d362733-bbeb-4459-8817-a51b2813ffd0_eip-725">All businesses can be classified into one of three categories: merchandising, service or manufacturing, with some companies combining aspects of two or all three of these categories within a single business. Each of these types of businesses has different strategic plans, and to implement these plans and reach their goals they make many business decisions every day. </p><p id="auto_8d362733-bbeb-4459-8817-a51b2813ffd0_eip-377">A significant portion of those decisions will involve identifying and analyzing the various costs of being in business. Some of these costs will be similar across these types of businesses while others will be unique. Knowing the basic characteristics of each of these categories is important to understanding how they measure and classify costs.

A <span data-type="term">merchandising organization</span> is one of the most common types of businesses. Merchandising firms purchase finished products and resell them to consumers. Consider your local grocery store or retail clothing store – both are merchandising firms. Often merchandising firms are referred to as resellers or retailers since they are in the business of re-selling a product to the consumer at a profit.
</p><p id="auto_8d362733-bbeb-4459-8817-a51b2813ffd0_eip-629">Consider purchasing toothpaste from your local drug store. The drug store purchases large quantities of toothpaste from a wholesale distributor. They may purchase tens of thousands of tubes of toothpaste to get a better per-tube cost. They then add their mark-up (or profit) to the tube and offer it for sale to you, a single tube at a time. The drug store did not manufacture the toothpaste, instead they are reselling the toothpaste they acquired from the wholesaler. Virtually all your daily purchases are made from merchandising firms such as Walmart, Target, Macy’s, Walgreens, and AutoZone, to name just a few.

How merchandising firms account for their costs is different from other types of business organizations. Let’s look at a simplified Income Statement for a merchandising firm as shown in <a href="#auto_8d362733-bbeb-4459-8817-a51b2813ffd0_eip-figure-02-01-CorpStruc" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.

<p id="auto_8d362733-bbeb-4459-8817-a51b2813ffd0_fs-idm351398464">Sales Revenue indicates that the company’s income was generated from the sale of finished goods to consumers rather than the manufacture of goods or provision of services. Since the merchandising firm purchases goods from a wholesaler, it must account for the cost of these goods, and this cost is reflected on the Income Statement as Cost of Goods Sold.

In our earlier example, the cost of the thousands of tubes of toothpaste is the Cost of Goods Sold. The difference between what the retailer paid the wholesaler for the toothpaste and revenue generated by selling the toothpaste to consumers is their Gross Profit. However, to generate sale revenue, merchandising firms incur expenses related to the process of selling the merchandise; hence, the deduction of Selling &amp; Administrative expenses from their Gross Profit. Selling &amp; Administrative Expenses are those expenses incurred by a merchandising firm that are not directly tied to the manufacturing costs of the product and include such expenses as insurance, marketing, administrative salaries and rent. Although this is a simplified Income Statement, it gives you an idea of how merchandising firms begin to account for their basic revenue and costs.

<p id="auto_8d362733-bbeb-4459-8817-a51b2813ffd0_fs-idm416257184">Merchandising firms are extremely cost sensitive since they must not only pass the cost of goods on to the consumer but also earn a profit. Large merchandising firms manage these costs by buying in bulk, and negotiating with wholesalers and suppliers to drive per unit cost as low as possible. At the same time they seek to drive costs down, they must also manage their selling and administrative expenses. In recent years, large retailers have reduced cost by introducing labor-saving features such as self-check-out to reduce their labor costs. </p>

</section><p id="auto_fc583f02-4b40-4c35-8b02-a5624f492d6f_eip-234">You may have heard the phrase, life is full of choices. Almost everything you do in life results from choosing between alternatives and whichever choice you make brings a certain set of consequences. For example, you face two alternatives, and two sets of consequences, when choosing whether to eat breakfast before going to class. Eating breakfast means you must get up a little earlier, have food available, and be willing to prepare the food. Not eating means sleeping in longer, not having to plan food, and being hungry during class. Just as our lives are fraught with decisions large and small, the same is true for businesses. Almost every aspect of being in business involves choosing between alternatives and each alternative has one or more consequences. Understanding how businesses make certain types of decisions provides insight into making a variety of business decisions and paves the path for not only better decision-making processes but potentially for better outcomes.
</p><p id="auto_fc583f02-4b40-4c35-8b02-a5624f492d6f_eip-189">Decisions made by a business can have either a short-term effect or have more of a long-term impact. Short-term decisions are often addressing a temporary circumstance or an immediate need whereas long-term decisions are more aligned with permanent problem solving and meeting of strategic goals. Because these two types of decisions require different types of analysis, we will consider short-term decision making in this chapter and long-term decision making in another chapter. We delineate between short-term and long-term decisions not only because of the difference in the general nature of these decisions but also because the types of analyses differ significantly between short-term and long-term decision categories. As we expand the time horizon over which the decision will have an impact, more costs become relevant to the decision-making process. In addition, when a time element is considered there will be additional factors such as interest (paid or received) that will have a greater influence on our decisions. <a href="#auto_fc583f02-4b40-4c35-8b02-a5624f492d6f_table-02-02-01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> provides examples of short-term and long-term business decisions.

Business decision making can be outlined as a process that is applied by management with each decision that is made. The process of decision making in a managerial business environment can be summed up in the following steps. WW-test notes that the heading below should be centered. WW-test notes this is a numeric list.

<li>Identify alternative courses of action that can achieve a goal or solve a problem that is hindering reaching a goal.</li>
<li>Perform a comprehensive (incremental) differential analysis of potential solutions. This includes identifying all costs, benefits and other financial and qualitative effects.</li>
<li>Decide, based upon the analysis, the best course of action.</li>
<li>Review, analyze and evaluate the results of the decision.</li>
</ol></div><p id="auto_fc583f02-4b40-4c35-8b02-a5624f492d6f_eip-374">The first two step of the decision-making process is to identify the goal. In the decisions discussed in this chapter, as with many business decisions, the goal is either to maximize income or minimize costs. The second step, which is to identify the alternative courses of action will also be clear for our decisions. Both steps one and two may require more thought and research than is apparent from the analyses in this chapter, but those types of discussions are left for future accounting and management courses. Our focus in this chapter will be on steps three and four which involve determining the appropriate elements of information for the decision being made and using that information in a proper analysis so an informed decision can be reached. Step five, which involves reviewing and evaluating the decision, is briefly addressed with each type of decision we analyze.</p><p id="auto_fc583f02-4b40-4c35-8b02-a5624f492d6f_eip-985">Up to this point, your study of managerial accounting has primarily been about classifying and tracking costs in certain types of environments. Revenues have been minimally addressed as emphasis has been on the ability of a company to monitor and control costs. Control of revenues is less viable since it is difficult to make a customer buy our product. However, as stated in the first step of the decision-making process, maximizing income is usually one of the goals of an organization. Therefore, in making some short-term decisions, both costs and revenues must be analyzed. </p><p id="auto_fc583f02-4b40-4c35-8b02-a5624f492d6f_eip-69">In carrying out step three of the managerial decision-making process, an incremental analysis of potential solutions is performed. What does this involve? First, it is important to understand there are many types of short-term decisions that a business may face, but these decisions always involve choosing between alternatives. Examples of these types of decisions include accepting a special order; making a product or component versus buying the product or component; performing additional processing on a product; keeping versus eliminating a product or segment; or taking on a new project. In each of these situations, the relevant costs and the relevant revenues of one alternative should be compared to the relevant costs and relevant revenues of the other alternative(s). Therefore, an important step in the incremental analysis of potential solutions, is identifying the relevant costs and <span data-type="term">relevant revenues</span> of the decision.</p><p id="auto_fc583f02-4b40-4c35-8b02-a5624f492d6f_eip-409">What does it mean for something to be <span data-type="term">relevant</span>? In the context of decision making, an item is relevant if it will influence the decision being made. For example, suppose you have two options for a summer job—either flagging traffic for a road crew or working for a landscaping company doing lawn care. For either job, you will be required to have industrial grade sound protectors (plugs or headphones) for your ears. This cost would not be relevant because it is the same under either alternative and therefore will not influence your decision between the two jobs. However, if you are required to have steel-toed boots for the road work job but can wear any type of work-boot for the landscaping job, you would need to consider the difference between the costs of these two types of boots. This difference in cost between the two pairs of boots would be designated as an <span data-type="term">incremental cost</span> and would be relevant to your decision. You believe your transportation costs will be the same for either job, thus this would also be an <span data-type="term">irrelevant cost</span>. There can also be differences in revenues. These are known as <span data-type="term">incremental revenues</span>. If both jobs pay the same hourly wage, but the road crew job pays overtime for any time worked over 40 hours, then this overtime wage has the potential to be an incremental revenue if overtime is a likely occurrence. When we only look at the incremental differences, this is known as <span data-type="term">incremental analysis</span>. In conducting these types of analyses between alternatives, our initial focus will be on the quantitative aspects of the analysis, or in other words, what do the numbers tell us. However, in decision making it is important to consider qualitative issues as well. For example, in the above summer job scenario, <span data-type="term">qualitative factors</span> may include the environment in which you would be working (road dust and tar odors, versus pollen and mower exhaust fumes), the amount of time exposed to the sun, the people with whom you will be working (some of the workers are friends already versus making new friends), and weather related issues (does either job cancel for the day due to weather). In making short-term decisions, a business will want to analyze both qualitative and <span data-type="term">quantitative factors</span>.
</p><p id="auto_fc583f02-4b40-4c35-8b02-a5624f492d6f_eip-782">In short-term decision making, revenues are often easier to evaluate than costs and typically there is only one revenue per alternative whereas there are typically many costs to consider for each alternative. How do we know if a cost will have an impact on the decision being made? The starting point is to understand the various labels that are attached to costs in these decision-making environments.

Management must determine if a cost is avoidable or unavoidable because only avoidable costs are relevant for decision-making purposes. An avoidable cost is one that can be eliminated (in whole or in part) by choosing one alternative over another. An unavoidable cost is one that does not change, or go away, if the other alternative is chosen. Variable costs are avoidable costs since variable costs do not exist if the product is no longer made, or if the portion of the business (such as a segment of division) which generated the variable costs ceases to operate (see <a href="#auto_fc583f02-4b40-4c35-8b02-a5624f492d6f_figure-02-02-MinWage" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.

Recall that fixed costs tend to remain constant for a period and are not easily eliminated in the short-run. Therefore, most fixed costs are unavoidable. If a fixed cost is specific only to one of the alternatives, then that fixed cost may be avoidable. Avoidable costs are future costs, not costs that have already been incurred and are therefore relevant to decision making. Sunk costs, on the other hand, are past costs and are never an avoidable cost.

A sunk cost will not change regardless of which alternative management chooses. This means that sunk costs are not relevant in decision-making as they have no bearing on future events and therefore should be excluded in decision making. The basic premise sounds simple enough but sunk costs are difficult to ignore due to human nature and are sometimes incorrectly included in the decision-making process. For example, suppose you have an old car, a hand-me-down from your grandmother, and last year you spent $1,600 on repairs and new tires and were just told by your mechanic that the car needs $1,200 in repairs to operate safely. Your goal is to have a safe and reliable car. Your alternatives are to get the repairs completed or trade in the car for a newer used car. From a quantitative perspective, you have gathered the following information to help with your decision. The trade-in value of your old car will be the minimum given by the dealer or $200. The newer used car will require you to make monthly payments of $150 for two years. You are faced with two alternatives: repair the existing car or trade it in for a newer used car. What costs do you consider? Remember, the $1,600 you have already spent (note the past tense) is a sunk cost—it is a consequence of a past decision. In this example, the relevant costs for each alternative are the $1,200 in current repair costs for the alternative to keep your current car, and $1,800 minus $200 trade in or $1,600 where the $1,800 is the 24 monthly payments of $150 for the alternative to buy a newer used car. Obviously qualitative factors would be considered such as the sentimental value of your grandmother’s car, shown in <a href="#auto_fc583f02-4b40-4c35-8b02-a5624f492d6f_figure-02-02-Perks" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.

The book value of an asset (historical cost – accumulated depreciation) is a sunk cost regardless of whether the asset it kept or disposed of in some manner. The cost of the asset occurred in the past and is therefore sunk and irrelevant to the decision at hand. Mangers may be reluctant to ignore sunk costs when making decisions, especially if the prior decision to purchase the asset was an unwise one. Often, when a path of action is taken by management, and that action is not achieving the desired results, managers may continue the same path in hope that the effect of prior decisions will improve. The key word in the previous sentence is “prior” which is a key indicator that information is non-relevant to a current decision. Hanging on to old decisions or old commitments is common as to do otherwise forces management to admit a bad decision was made.

Any future cost that does not differ between the alternatives in a decision is not a relevant cost as far as that decision is concerned. As explained in H2, the cost of sound protectors for your summer job would not be relevant to your decision as that cost exists under either scenario. Another irrelevant cost would be your transportation cost since that cost is also the same under either alternative. If a company is planning to either produce Red Widgets or Blue Wingdings and in either scenario, will require hiring ten additional employees, the cost of those ten employees is irrelevant as the cost does not differ between the alternatives.

When choosing between two alternatives, usually only one of the two choices can be selected. Opportunity costs are the costs associated with not choosing the other alternative. For example, if you are trying to choose between going to work immediately after completing your undergraduate degree or continuing to graduate school, you will have an opportunity cost. If you choose to go to work immediately, your <span data-type="term">opportunity cost</span> is forgoing a graduate degree, and any potential job limitations or advancements that result from that decision. If you choose instead to go directly into graduate school, your opportunity cost is the income that you could have been earning by going to work immediately upon graduation.

As such, many service industries have little or no emphasis on materials. The movie industry treats the cost of constructing movie sets as direct materials while accounting firms only direct material is supplies which is considered an indirect material expense.
</p><p id="auto_fc583f02-4b40-4c35-8b02-a5624f492d6f_eip-554">Instead of being dependent on materials; service industries depend on labor. Since it is labor intensive; it makes sense to used labor as an activity base and billable hours is often the best allocation base. For example, in an audit assignment, there often will be several accountants involved in the assignment, with differing levels of experience and expertise. The accounting firms have more billable hours at the staff level and less billable hours at the partner level. And since the firm bills the partner’s time at a significantly higher rate than the staff; it makes sense to apply overhead at the billable hours instead of the billable costs.

  <p id="auto_57270dee-f347-4230-b3db-cd8b804db63b_eip-736">WW-test notes that this appendix content includes index terms (length, mass, time), tables, tables with captions, a figure, an image, a footnote, centered text, one very long header, and LO icons. In the American system of measurement (originally developed in England), the fundamental units of length, weight, and time are the foot, pound, and second, respectively. There are also larger and smaller units, which include the ton (2240 lb), the mile (5280 ft), the rod (16 1/2 ft), the yard (3 ft), the inch (1/12 ft), the ounce (1/16 lb), and so on. Such units, whose origins in decisions by British royalty have been forgotten by most people, are quite inconvenient for conversion or doing calculations.</p><p id="auto_57270dee-f347-4230-b3db-cd8b804db63b_eip-958">Calculations can be centered WW-test without MathType<span data-type="newline"><br /></span>

<strong class="centered-text">In science, therefore, it is more usual to use the <em data-effect="italics">metric system</em>, which has been adopted in virtually all countries except the United States. Its great advantage is that every unit increases by a factor of ten, instead of the strange factors in the American system. The fundamental units of the metric system are:</strong>

<li><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">mass</span>: 1 kilogram (kg)</li>

</li></ul><p id="auto_57270dee-f347-4230-b3db-cd8b804db63b_eip-394">A meter was originally intended to be 1 ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along the surface of Earth. It is about 1.1 yd. A kilogram is the mass that on Earth results in a weight of about 2.2 lb.

  <section data-depth="1" id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-918"><h3 data-type="title">Slide Show Tab</h3><p id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-248">
So, now you have completed your presentation and all that is left is the editing. That is a big job in itself, but you want it to be perfect. There are three command groups on the Slideshow ribbon. The first is called Start Slide Show. Choose From the Beginning, or From Current Slide, and the presentation will do just that. Next, you can choose the option to Present Online, which entails using the free Office Presentation Service so that your slideshow can be viewed through a Web browser. You need to set up a Microsoft account, however, to use this option. The next command is Custom Slide Show. This command allows you to pick the slides to use in the show, a helpful option should the need arise to shorten the presentation.

</p><p id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-358">The next set of commands is the Set Up group. This is the area where you would deal with the practical issues affecting a presentation. Rehearsing the timing, playing narration, and other options are controlled on this ribbon. Again, there are other hidden selections to be made. Clicking on the Set Up Slide Show button extends the menu.</p><p id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-126">As you can see, you can set the show type as Presented by a speaker in full screen mode, Browsed by an individual in window mode, or Browsed at a kiosk in full screen mode. Then, you have the options of showing your presentation by a continuous loop, with or without narration, with or without animation, and so on. You will set these options as required. To the right, you may choose to Hide a slide, Rehearse the timing, or Record the slideshow. Other options in this window require just checking the appropriate boxes, such as Keep Slides Updated, Play Narration, etc. The last command group is Monitors, which simply asks you to choose whether the show will run automatically, or on a primary monitor, and whether to use Presenter View.
</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-744"><h3 data-type="title">Review Tab</h3><p id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-574">
The Review tab is used primarily when you are collaborating on a presentation with someone else or incorporating feedback on your draft slides. However, this tab still offers valuable resources if you are creating your presentation on your own. For example, the first command group is Proofing. This function checks the spelling in the whole presentation. The Thesaurus command is very helpful as you write the dialogue that accompanies the slide show.
</p><p id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-23">The next command group is Accessibility. When you click on Check Accessibility, PowerPoint investigates the slides in your show and then notifies you if you need alternative text, whether an element is missing from a slide, and so on. These comments are shown in a pane that pops up to the right of the slide.
</p><p id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-790">The last four command groups in the Review tab are Insights, Language, Comments, and Compare. The Insights command has a function called Smart Lookup, a very useful feature that, when text is selected, will generate definitions by several dictionaries, check a thesaurus for synonyms, and find related images and videos. The Language command group translates text to other languages, or it will change the language of the presentation. The next group in the ribbon is Comments. You can add comments, delete comments, or move ahead and move back to check out other comments. This is one of the main functions of the Review command when you are working with others on the same document. Finally, we have the Compare group of commands. Here you can compare different versions of a presentation or merge a file on your computer with a slide.

The View tab ribbon has 7 command groups starting with Presentation Views. This is self-explanatory, as the ribbon provides pictures of the various views. However, let’s take a look at each view and explain the reasoning behind them.
</p><p id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-235">Normal view is the view you work with as you create the slides. The large window shows the current slide, and the other slides are shown down the left side of the window. Outline view shows a list of the slides on the left, but with only the text. In this view, you can add text to your presentation without having to actually insert it on the slide. Slide Sorter view lays out your slides in order. This is useful when you want to change the order of the slides or delete a slide. Slides can be moved around easily with “drag and drop.” The Notes View shows a single slide with the notes below. This is useful when you want to add or edit a large amount of text. Reading view shows your slides one at a time like they would appear in the show.
</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-564"><h4 data-type="title">Slide Master View</h4><p id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-754">
A Slide Master or Master View is simply a template. It is a time-saving method used to create professional and consistent presentations. You can start with one of the PowerPoint themes, or a blank slide, add or change the colors, add borders, change the font, and change or create a layout of your own. You can insert textboxes and object placeholders. You have now created a template that unifies the slides in your presentation. Then, click on File, Save As, choose location, and in file type, choose PowerPoint Template.
</p></section></section><section data-depth="1" id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-941"><h3 data-type="title">Design Ideas Pane</h3><p id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-876">
The Design Ideas pane is available as soon as you begin a new presentation. It contains more themes for your presentation. However, there is a big difference between the regular PowerPoint themes and those presented in the Design Ideas pane: The Design Ideas pane is where to go if you want to create a presentation that is dynamic, unusual, and alive. Some even have videos attached. Additionally, the Design Ideas offerings change all the time. Every time you open PowerPoint you will see a new collection of ideas. You can choose to not see these ideas by clicking the little arrow, but they offer a wealth of interesting options to consider. Even if you are creating a more conservative presentation, just seeing what they come up with can be inspiring.
</p><section data-depth="2" id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-424"><h4 data-type="title">Speaker’s Notes</h4><p id="auto_2108d530-effc-4965-a701-3f3c3d596a4f_eip-920">
To add speaker’s notes to your presentation, display the slide and then click on Notes in the Status Bar. You will see the Notes pane appear below the slide. Type your notes and click Save. When you view your presentation, you will see the notes appear below the slide.
