    </div>
            <ul>
              <li>In explanations of endocrine function, reproduction, development, inheritance, and related topics, the second edition is clearer and more accurate in differentiations related to sex, and eliminates incorrect equivalencies and generalizations regarding sex and gender. OpenStax thanks Sam Long and River Suh, founders of Gender-Inclusive Biology, for their extensive guidance and support.</li>
              <li>Many of the illustrations have been improved to be more representative of diverse populations. We have also added photos of many conditions, symptoms, and disorders that present differently depending on skin tone. (Note that many of the illustration changes were made prior to the second edition revision.)</li>
              <li>In discussions and illustrations of genetics and inheritance, the text is clearer in its terminology and explanations related to parenting and parental roles.</li>
              <li>Several research references, data, and terminology have been improved to improve representation and currency.</li>

    These improvements are designed to create welcoming and inclusive learning experiences and promote scientifically accurate practices that students will encounter in their studies and careers. The additions and changes were made in a manner designed to enrich and support all users while maintaining the general approach of the text. Because OpenStax and our authors are aware of the difficulties posed by reorganization and renumbering, the extensive text and illustration changes have been implemented within the existing structure and organization of the book. A detailed transition guide will be available within the book&#x2019;s Instructor Resources at OpenStax.org.

          <p id="auto_7c42370b-c3ad-48ac-9620-d15367b882c6_eip-287">
Our unique approach to visuals is designed to emphasize only the components most important in any given illustration. The art style is particularly aimed at focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations.
</p>
          <p id="auto_7c42370b-c3ad-48ac-9620-d15367b882c6_eip-id1167703115240">Much of the art in this book consists of black line illustrations. The strongest line is used to highlight the most important structures, and shading is used to show dimension and shape. Color is used sparingly to highlight and clarify the primary anatomical or functional point of the illustration. This technique is intended to draw students&#x2019; attention to the critical learning point in the illustration, without distraction from excessive gradients, shadows, and highlights. Full color is used when the structure or process requires it (for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular system illustrations).

An understanding of anatomy and physiology is not only fundamental to any career in the health professions, but it can also benefit your own health. Familiarity with the human body can help you make healthful choices and prompt you to take appropriate action when signs of illness arise.

      is the scientific study of the body&#x2019;s structures. Some of these structures are very small and can only be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen, manipulated, measured, and weighed. The
      word &#x201C;anatomy&#x201D; comes from a Greek root that means &#x201C;to cut apart.&#x201D; Human anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and other injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the
      dead to augment their knowledge. When a body is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to one another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in
      pathology labs. In order to observe structures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow clinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured
      bone.</p>

      <span data-type="term" id="auto_ada35081-9ec4-4eb8-98b2-3ce350d5427f_term-00004" group-by="R">Regional anatomy</span>
      is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen. Studying regional anatomy helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and
      other structures work together to serve a particular body region. In contrast,
      <span data-type="term" id="auto_ada35081-9ec4-4eb8-98b2-3ce350d5427f_term-00005" group-by="s">systemic anatomy</span>
      is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system&#x2014;that is, a group of structures that work together to perform a unique body function. For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system would consider all of the skeletal
      muscles of the body.</p>
          <p id="auto_ada35081-9ec4-4eb8-98b2-3ce350d5427f_fs-id1707081">Whereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human

      is the scientific study of the chemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the functions of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body&#x2019;s tendency toward homeostasis.
      <span data-type="term" id="auto_ada35081-9ec4-4eb8-98b2-3ce350d5427f_term-00007" group-by="H">Homeostasis</span>
      is the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology certainly includes observation, both with the naked eye and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However, current advances in
      physiology usually depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments that reveal the functions of the many structures and chemical compounds that make up the human body.</p>
          <p id="auto_ada35081-9ec4-4eb8-98b2-3ce350d5427f_fs-id2297149">Like anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology is the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together to perform functions as
      complex and diverse as vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example, what different parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels along
      nerves).</p>
          <p id="auto_ada35081-9ec4-4eb8-98b2-3ce350d5427f_fs-id2104406">Form is closely related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear away dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again. At the
      microscopic level, the arrangement and function of the nerves and muscles that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a smaller level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of
      specific molecules and ions. Even the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.</p>
          <p id="auto_ada35081-9ec4-4eb8-98b2-3ce350d5427f_fs-id2080383">Your study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate the form of the structures you are studying to their function. In fact, it can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an
      understanding of the physiology that a body structure supports. Imagine, for example, trying to appreciate the unique arrangement of the bones of the human hand if you had no conception of the function of the hand. Fortunately, your understanding of
      how the human hand manipulates tools&#x2014;from pens to cell phones&#x2014;helps you appreciate the unique alignment of the thumb in opposition to the four fingers, making your hand a structure that allows you to pinch and grasp objects and type text messages.</p>

All matter in the universe is composed of one or more unique pure substances called elements, familiar examples of which are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, and iron. The smallest unit of any of these pure substances (elements) is an atom. Atoms are made up of subatomic particles such as the proton, electron and neutron. Two or more atoms combine to form a molecule, such as the water molecules, proteins, and sugars found in living things. Molecules are the chemical building blocks of all body structures.</p>

  In this book and throughout your studies of biological sciences, you will often read descriptions related to similarities and differences among biological structures, processes, and health related to a person's biological sex. People often use the words "female" and "male" to describe two different concepts: our sense of gender identity, and our biological sex as determined by our chromosomes, hormones, organs, and other physical characteristics. For some people, gender identity is different from biological sex or their sex assigned at birth. Throughout this book, "female" and "male" refer to sex only, and the typical anatomy and physiology of XX and XY individuals is discussed.</p>

These compartments keep body cells separated from external environmental threats and keep the cells moist and nourished. They also separate internal body fluids from the countless microorganisms that grow on body surfaces, including the lining of certain passageways that connect to the outer surface of the body. The intestinal tract, for example, is home to more bacterial cells than the total of all human cells in the body, yet these bacteria are outside the body and cannot be allowed to circulate freely inside the body.</p>
            <p id="auto_59221da8-5fb6-4b3e-9450-079cd616385b_fs-id2352225">Cells, for example, have a cell membrane (also referred to as the plasma membrane) that keeps the intracellular environment&#x2014;the fluids and organelles&#x2014;separate from the extracellular environment. Blood vessels keep blood inside a closed circulatory system, and nerves and muscles are wrapped in connective tissue sheaths that separate them from surrounding structures. In the chest and abdomen, a variety of internal membranes keep major organs such as the lungs, heart, and kidneys separate from others.</p>

As you read these words, red and white blood cells are moving throughout your body, muscle cells are contracting and relaxing to maintain your posture and to focus your vision, and glands are secreting chemicals to regulate body functions. Your body is coordinating the action of entire muscle groups to enable you to move air into and out of your lungs, to push blood throughout your body, and to propel the food you have eaten through your digestive tract. Consciously, of course, you contract your skeletal muscles to move the bones of your skeleton to get from one place to another (as the runners are doing in <a href="#auto_59221da8-5fb6-4b3e-9450-079cd616385b_fig-ch01_03_02" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.7</a>), and to carry out all of the activities of your daily life.</p>

Earth and its atmosphere have provided us with air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat, but these are not the only requirements for survival. Although you may rarely think about it, you also cannot live outside of a certain range of temperature and pressure that the surface of our planet and its atmosphere provides. The next sections explore these four requirements of life.</p>

            <h3 data-type="title">Nutrients</h3>
            <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id2532130">A <span data-type="term" id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_term-00001" group-by="n">nutrient</span> is a substance in foods and beverages that is essential to human survival. The three basic classes of nutrients are water, the energy-yielding and body-building nutrients, and the micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).</p>
            <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id1250210">The most critical nutrient is water. Depending on the environmental temperature and our state of health, we may be able to survive for only a few days without water. The body&#x2019;s functional chemicals are dissolved and transported in water, and the chemical reactions of life take place in water. Moreover, water is the largest component of cells, blood, and the fluid between cells, and water makes up about 70 percent of an adult&#x2019;s body mass. Water also helps regulate our internal temperature and cushions, protects, and lubricates joints and many other body structures.</p>
            <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id2269270">The energy-yielding nutrients are primarily carbohydrates and lipids, while proteins mainly supply the amino acids that are the building blocks of the body itself. You ingest these in plant and animal foods and beverages, and the digestive system breaks them down into molecules small enough to be absorbed. The breakdown products of carbohydrates and lipids can then be used in the metabolic processes that convert them to ATP. Although you might feel as if you are starving after missing a single meal, you can survive without consuming the energy-yielding nutrients for at least several weeks.</p>
            <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id1841065">Water and the energy-yielding nutrients are also referred to as macronutrients because the body needs them in large amounts. In contrast, micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. These elements and compounds participate in many essential chemical reactions and processes, such as nerve impulses, and some, such as calcium, also contribute to the body&#x2019;s structure. Your body can store some of the micronutrients in its tissues, and draw on those reserves if you fail to consume them in your diet for a few days or weeks. Some others micronutrients, such as vitamin C and most of the B vitamins, are water-soluble and cannot be stored, so you need to consume them every day or two.</p>

            <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id1758474">You have probably seen news stories about athletes who died of heat stroke, or hikers who died of exposure to cold. Such deaths occur because the chemical reactions upon which the body depends can only take place within a narrow range of body temperature, from just below to just above 37&#xB0;C (98.6&#xB0;F). When body temperature rises well above or drops well below normal, certain proteins (enzymes) that facilitate chemical reactions lose their normal structure and their ability to function and the chemical reactions of metabolism cannot proceed.</p>
            <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id1688531">That said, the body can respond effectively to short-term exposure to heat (<a href="#auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fig-ch01_04_01" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.8</a>) or cold. One of the body&#x2019;s responses to heat is, of course, sweating. As sweat evaporates from skin, it removes some thermal energy from the body, cooling it. Adequate water (from the extracellular fluid in the body) is necessary to produce sweat, so adequate fluid intake is essential to balance that loss during the sweat response. Not surprisingly, the sweat response is much less effective in a humid environment because the air is already saturated with water. Thus, the sweat on the skin&#x2019;s surface is not able to evaporate, and internal body temperature can get dangerously high.</p>

One response to cold is shivering, which is random muscle movement that generates heat. Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to generate heat. When that energy reserve is depleted, however, and the core temperature begins to drop significantly, red blood cells will lose their ability to give up oxygen, denying the brain of this critical component of ATP production. This lack of oxygen can cause confusion, lethargy, and eventually loss of consciousness and death. The body responds to cold by reducing blood circulation to the extremities, the hands and feet, in order to prevent blood from cooling there and so that the body&#x2019;s core can stay warm. Even when core body temperature remains stable, however, tissues exposed to severe cold, especially the fingers and toes, can develop frostbite when blood flow to the extremities has been much reduced. This form of tissue damage can be permanent and lead to gangrene, requiring amputation of the affected region.</p>

As you have learned, the body continuously engages in coordinated physiological processes to maintain a stable temperature. In some cases, however, overriding this system can be useful, or even life-saving. Hypothermia is the clinical term for an abnormally low body temperature (hypo- = &#x201C;below&#x201D; or &#x201C;under&#x201D;). Controlled hypothermia is clinically induced hypothermia performed in order to reduce the metabolic rate of an organ or of a person&#x2019;s entire body.</p>
                <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id2471181">Controlled hypothermia often is used, for example, during open-heart surgery because it decreases the metabolic needs of the brain, heart, and other organs, reducing the risk of damage to them. When controlled hypothermia is used clinically, the patient is given medication to prevent shivering. The body is then cooled to 25&#x2013;32&#xB0;C (79&#x2013;89&#xB0;F). The heart is stopped and an external heart-lung pump maintains circulation to the patient&#x2019;s body. The heart is cooled further and is maintained at a temperature below 15&#xB0;C (60&#xB0;F) for the duration of the surgery. This very cold temperature helps the heart muscle to tolerate its lack of blood supply during the surgery.</p>
                <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id2463653">Some emergency department physicians use controlled hypothermia to reduce damage to the heart in patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest. In the emergency department, the physician induces coma and lowers the patient&#x2019;s body temperature to approximately 91 degrees. This condition, which is maintained for 24 hours, slows the patient&#x2019;s metabolic rate. Because the patient&#x2019;s organs require less blood to function, the heart&#x2019;s workload is reduced.</p>

            <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id2567469"><span data-type="term" id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_term-00002" group-by="P">Pressure</span> is a force exerted by a substance that is in contact with another substance. Atmospheric pressure is pressure exerted by the mixture of gases (primarily nitrogen and oxygen) in the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere. Although you may not perceive it, atmospheric pressure is constantly pressing down on your body. This pressure keeps gases within your body, such as the gaseous nitrogen in body fluids, dissolved. If you were suddenly ejected from a space ship above Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere, you would go from a situation of normal pressure to one of very low pressure. The pressure of the nitrogen gas in your blood would be much higher than the pressure of nitrogen in the space surrounding your body. As a result, the nitrogen gas in your blood would expand, forming bubbles that could block blood vessels and even cause cells to break apart.</p>
            <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id1648023">Atmospheric pressure does more than just keep blood gases dissolved. Your ability to breathe&#x2014;that is, to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide&#x2014;also depends upon a precise atmospheric pressure. Altitude sickness occurs in part because the atmosphere at high altitudes exerts less pressure, reducing the exchange of these gases, and causing shortness of breath, confusion, headache, lethargy, and nausea. Mountain climbers carry oxygen to reduce the effects of both low oxygen levels and low barometric pressure at higher altitudes (<a href="#auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fig-ch01_04_02" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.9</a>).</p>

Decompression sickness (DCS) is a condition in which gases dissolved in the blood or in other body tissues are no longer dissolved following a reduction in pressure on the body. This condition affects underwater divers who surface from a deep dive too quickly, and it can affect pilots flying at high altitudes in planes with unpressurized cabins. Divers often call this condition &#x201C;the bends,&#x201D; a reference to joint pain that is a symptom of DCS.</p>
                <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id2153756">In all cases, DCS is brought about by a reduction in barometric pressure. At high altitude, barometric pressure is much less than on Earth&#x2019;s surface because pressure is produced by the weight of the column of air above the body pressing down on the body. The very great pressures on divers in deep water are likewise from the weight of a column of water pressing down on the body. For divers, DCS occurs at normal barometric pressure (at sea level), but it is brought on by the relatively rapid decrease of pressure as divers rise from the high pressure conditions of deep water to the now low, by comparison, pressure at sea level. Not surprisingly, diving in deep mountain lakes, where barometric pressure at the surface of the lake is less than that at sea level is more likely to result in DCS than diving in water at sea level.</p>
                <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id1884492">In DCS, gases dissolved in the blood (primarily nitrogen) come rapidly out of solution, forming bubbles in the blood and in other body tissues. This occurs because when pressure of a gas over a liquid is decreased, the amount of gas that can remain dissolved in the liquid also is decreased. It is air pressure that keeps your normal blood gases dissolved in the blood. When pressure is reduced, less gas remains dissolved. You have seen this in effect when you open a carbonated drink. Removing the seal of the bottle reduces the pressure of the gas over the liquid. This in turn causes bubbles as dissolved gases (in this case, carbon dioxide) come out of solution in the liquid.</p>
                <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id2431360">The most common symptoms of DCS are pain in the joints, with headache and disturbances of vision occurring in 10 percent to 15 percent of cases. Left untreated, very severe DCS can result in death. Immediate treatment is with pure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced, closed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body so that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to the body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing some of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.</p>

            <p id="auto_00a2d5b6-9b1d-49ab-a40d-fcd30ceef643_fs-id2097735">The dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the pressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body tissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the pulsating flow of pressurized blood.</p>

            <p id="auto_f10ff9a5-0428-4700-8676-96ad36c4ac64_fs-id1291623">In order to set the system in motion, a stimulus must drive a physiological parameter beyond its normal range (that is, beyond homeostasis). This stimulus is &#x201C;heard&#x201D; by a specific sensor. For example, in the control of blood glucose, specific endocrine cells in the pancreas detect excess glucose (the stimulus) in the bloodstream. These pancreatic beta cells respond to the increased level of blood glucose by releasing the hormone insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose, removing it from the bloodstream. As glucose concentration in the bloodstream drops, the decrease in concentration&#x2014;the actual negative feedback&#x2014;is detected by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops. This prevents blood sugar levels from continuing to drop below the normal range.</p>
            <p id="auto_f10ff9a5-0428-4700-8676-96ad36c4ac64_fs-id775958">Humans have a similar temperature regulation feedback system that works by promoting either heat loss or heat gain (<a href="#auto_f10ff9a5-0428-4700-8676-96ad36c4ac64_fig-ch01_05_01" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.10</a><strong>b</strong>). When the brain&#x2019;s temperature regulation center receives data from the sensors indicating that the body&#x2019;s temperature exceeds its normal range, it stimulates a cluster of brain cells referred to as the &#x201C;heat-loss center.&#x201D; This stimulation has three major effects:</p>
            <ul id="auto_f10ff9a5-0428-4700-8676-96ad36c4ac64_fs-id1221013">
              <li>Blood vessels in the skin begin to dilate allowing more blood from the body core to flow to the surface of the skin allowing the heat to radiate into the environment.</li>
              <li>As blood flow to the skin increases, sweat glands are activated to increase their output. As the sweat evaporates from the skin surface into the surrounding air, it takes heat with it.</li>
              <li>The depth of respiration increases, and a person may breathe through an open mouth instead of through the nasal passageways. This further increases heat loss from the lungs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="auto_f10ff9a5-0428-4700-8676-96ad36c4ac64_fs-id2226448">In contrast, activation of the brain&#x2019;s heat-gain center by exposure to cold reduces blood flow to the skin, and blood returning from the limbs is diverted into a network of deep veins. This arrangement traps heat closer to the body core and restricts heat loss. If heat loss is severe, the brain triggers an increase in random signals to skeletal muscles, causing them to contract and producing shivering. The muscle contractions of shivering release heat while using up ATP. The brain triggers the thyroid gland in the endocrine system to release thyroid hormone, which increases metabolic activity and heat production in cells throughout the body. The brain also signals the adrenal glands to release epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone that causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which can be used as an energy source. The breakdown of glycogen into glucose also results in increased metabolism and heat production.</p>

            <p id="auto_f10ff9a5-0428-4700-8676-96ad36c4ac64_fs-id2570988">The first contractions of labor (the stimulus) push the baby toward the cervix (the lowest part of the uterus). The cervix contains stretch-sensitive nerve cells that monitor the degree of stretching (the sensors). These nerve cells send messages to the brain, which in turn causes the pituitary gland at the base of the brain to release the hormone oxytocin into the bloodstream. Oxytocin causes stronger contractions of the smooth muscles in of the uterus (the effectors), pushing the baby further down the birth canal. This causes even greater stretching of the cervix. The cycle of stretching, oxytocin release, and increasingly more forceful contractions stops only when the baby is born. At this point, the stretching of the cervix halts, stopping the release of oxytocin.</p>
            <p id="auto_f10ff9a5-0428-4700-8676-96ad36c4ac64_fs-id2239774">A second example of positive feedback centers on reversing extreme damage to the body. Following a penetrating wound, the most immediate threat is excessive blood loss. Less blood circulating means reduced blood pressure and reduced perfusion (penetration of blood) to the brain and other vital organs. If perfusion is severely reduced, vital organs will shut down and the person will die. The body responds to this potential catastrophe by releasing substances in the injured blood vessel wall that begin the process of blood clotting. As each step of clotting occurs, it stimulates the release of more clotting substances. This accelerates the processes of clotting and sealing off the damaged area. Clotting is contained in a local area based on the tightly controlled availability of clotting proteins. This is an adaptive, life-saving cascade of events.</p>

However, the purpose of this language is not to confuse, but rather to increase precision and reduce medical errors. For example, is a scar &#x201C;above the wrist&#x201D; located on the forearm two or three inches away from the hand? Or is it at the base of the hand? Is it on the palm-side or back-side? By using precise anatomical terminology, we eliminate ambiguity. Anatomical terms derive from ancient Greek and Latin words. Because these languages are no longer used in everyday conversation, the meaning of their words does not change.</p>
          <p id="auto_17e4eea8-a005-45af-b835-f756a014cd48_fs-id2523539">Anatomical terms are made up of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. The root of a term often refers to an organ, tissue, or condition, whereas the prefix or suffix often describes the root. For example, in the disorder hypertension, the prefix &#x201C;hyper-&#x201D; means &#x201C;high&#x201D; or &#x201C;over,&#x201D; and the root word &#x201C;tension&#x201D; refers to pressure, so the word &#x201C;hypertension&#x201D; refers to abnormally high blood pressure.</p>

The two pleural cavities are situated on both sides of the body, anterior to the spine and lateral to the breastbone. The superior mediastinum is a wedge-shaped cavity located between the superior regions of the two thoracic cavities. The pericardial cavity within the mediastinum is located at the center of the chest below the superior mediastinum. The pericardial cavity roughly outlines the shape of the heart. The diaphragm divides the thoracic and the abdominal cavities. The abdominal cavity occupies the entire lower half of the trunk, anterior to the spine. Just under the abdominal cavity, anterior to the buttocks, is the pelvic cavity. The pelvic cavity is funnel shaped and is located inferior and anterior to the abdominal cavity. Together the abdominal and pelvic cavity can be referred to as the abdominopelvic cavity while the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities together can be referred to as the ventral body cavity." width="550" id="auto_17e4eea8-a005-45af-b835-f756a014cd48_9" />

Both the parietal and visceral serosa secrete the thin, slippery serous fluid located within the serous cavities. The pleural cavity reduces friction between the lungs and the body wall. Likewise, the pericardial cavity reduces friction between the heart and the wall of the pericardium. The peritoneal cavity reduces friction between the abdominal and pelvic organs and the body wall.

An inability to control bleeding, infection, and pain made surgeries infrequent, and those that were performed&#x2014;such as wound suturing, amputations, tooth and tumor removals, skull drilling, and cesarean births&#x2014;did not greatly advance knowledge about internal anatomy. Theories about the function of the body and about disease were therefore largely based on external observations and imagination. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however, the detailed anatomical drawings of Italian artist and anatomist Leonardo da Vinci and Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius were published, and interest in human anatomy began to increase. Medical schools began to teach anatomy using human dissection; although some resorted to grave robbing to obtain corpses. Laws were eventually passed that enabled students to dissect the corpses of criminals and those who donated their bodies for research. Still, it was not until the late nineteenth century that medical researchers discovered non-surgical methods to look inside the living body.</p>

            <p id="auto_bda09c0d-e898-4653-9d37-3cb49fab55e5_fs-id2162168">German physicist Wilhelm R&#xF6;ntgen (1845&#x2013;1923) was experimenting with electrical current when he discovered that a mysterious and invisible &#x201C;ray&#x201D; would pass through his flesh but leave an outline of his bones on a screen coated with a metal compound. In 1895, R&#xF6;ntgen made the first durable record of the internal parts of a living human: an &#x201C;X-ray&#x201D; image (as it came to be called) of his wife&#x2019;s hand. Scientists around the world quickly began their own experiments with X-rays, and by 1900, X-rays were widely used to detect a variety of injuries and diseases. In 1901, R&#xF6;ntgen was awarded the first Nobel Prize for physics for his work in this field.</p>

As they are used in medicine, X-rays are emitted from an X-ray machine and directed toward a specially treated metallic plate placed behind the patient&#x2019;s body. The beam of radiation results in darkening of the X-ray plate. X-rays are slightly impeded by soft tissues, which show up as gray on the X-ray plate, whereas hard tissues, such as bone, largely block the rays, producing a light-toned &#x201C;shadow.&#x201D; Thus, X-rays are best used to visualize hard body structures such as teeth and bones (<a href="#auto_bda09c0d-e898-4653-9d37-3cb49fab55e5_fig-ch01_07_01" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.18</a>). Like many forms of high energy radiation, however, X-rays are capable of damaging cells and initiating changes that can lead to cancer. This danger of excessive exposure to X-rays was not fully appreciated for many years after their widespread use.</p>

Although often supplanted by more sophisticated imaging techniques, the X-ray remains a &#x201C;workhorse&#x201D; in medical imaging, especially for viewing fractures and for dentistry. The disadvantage of irradiation to the patient and the operator is now attenuated by proper shielding and by limiting exposure.</p>

The technique was invented in the 1970s and is based on the principle that, as X-rays pass through the body, they are absorbed or reflected at different levels. In the technique, a patient lies on a motorized platform while a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scanner rotates 360 degrees around the patient, taking X-ray images. A computer combines these images into a two-dimensional view of the scanned area, or &#x201C;slice.&#x201D;</p>

It is especially useful for soft tissue scanning, such as of the brain and the thoracic and abdominal viscera. Its level of detail is so precise that it can allow physicians to measure the size of a mass down to a millimeter. The main disadvantage of CT scanning is that it exposes patients to a dose of radiation many times higher than that of X-rays. In fact, children who undergo CT scans are at increased risk of developing cancer, as are adults who have multiple CT scans.</p>

In 1970, a physician and researcher named Raymond Damadian noticed that malignant (cancerous) tissue gave off different signals than normal body tissue. He applied for a patent for the first MRI scanning device, which was in use clinically by the early 1980s. The early MRI scanners were crude, but advances in digital computing and electronics led to their advancement over any other technique for precise imaging, especially to discover tumors. MRI also has the major advantage of not exposing patients to radiation.</p>
              <p id="auto_bda09c0d-e898-4653-9d37-3cb49fab55e5_fs-id1960262">Drawbacks of MRI scans include their much higher cost, and patient discomfort with the procedure. The MRI scanner subjects the patient to such powerful electromagnets that the scan room must be shielded. The patient must be enclosed in a metal tube-like device for the duration of the scan (see <a href="#auto_bda09c0d-e898-4653-9d37-3cb49fab55e5_fig-ch01_07_02" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.19</a><strong>b</strong>), sometimes as long as thirty minutes, which can be uncomfortable and impractical for ill patients. The device is also so noisy that, even with earplugs, patients can become anxious or even fearful. These problems have been overcome somewhat with the development of &#x201C;open&#x201D; MRI scanning, which does not require the patient to be entirely enclosed in the metal tube. Patients with iron-containing metallic implants (internal sutures, some prosthetic devices, and so on) cannot undergo MRI scanning because it can dislodge these implants.</p>
              <p id="auto_bda09c0d-e898-4653-9d37-3cb49fab55e5_fs-id2291906">Functional MRIs (fMRIs), which detect the concentration of blood flow in certain parts of the body, are increasingly being used to study the activity in parts of the brain during various body activities. This has helped scientists learn more about the locations of different brain functions and more about brain abnormalities and diseases.</p>

The main advantage is that PET (see <a href="#auto_bda09c0d-e898-4653-9d37-3cb49fab55e5_fig-ch01_07_02" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.19</a><strong>c</strong>) can illustrate physiologic activity&#x2014;including nutrient metabolism and blood flow&#x2014;of the organ or organs being targeted, whereas CT and MRI scans can only show static images. PET is widely used to diagnose a multitude of conditions, such as heart disease, the spread of cancer, certain forms of infection, brain abnormalities, bone disease, and thyroid disease.</p>

Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all imaging techniques, and it is therefore used more freely in sensitive situations such as pregnancy. The technology was first developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Ultrasonography is used to study heart function, blood flow in the neck or extremities, certain conditions such as gallbladder disease, and fetal growth and development. The main disadvantages of ultrasonography are that the image quality is heavily operator-dependent and that it is unable to penetrate bone and gas.</p>

In the past, anatomy has primarily been studied via observing injuries, and later by the dissection of anatomical structures of cadavers, but in the past century,
        computer-assisted imaging techniques have allowed clinicians to look inside the living body. Human physiology is the scientific study of the chemistry and physics of the structures of the body. Physiology explains how the structures of the body work
        together to maintain life. It is difficult to study structure (anatomy) without knowledge of function (physiology). The two disciplines are typically studied together because form and function are closely related in all living things.</p>

These include the chemical, cellular, tissue, organ, organ system, and the organism level. Higher levels of organization are built from lower levels. Therefore, molecules combine to form cells, cells combine to form tissues, tissues combine to form organs, organs combine to form organ systems, and organ systems combine to form organisms.</p>

Although the body can respond to high temperatures by sweating and to low temperatures by shivering and increased fuel consumption, long-term exposure to extreme heat and cold is not compatible with survival. The body requires a precise atmospheric pressure to maintain its gases in solution and to facilitate respiration&#x2014;the intake of oxygen and the release of carbon dioxide. Humans also require blood pressure high enough to ensure that blood reaches all body tissues but low enough to avoid damage to blood vessels.</p>

Homeostasis is regulated by negative feedback loops and, much less frequently, by positive feedback loops. Both have the same components of a stimulus, sensor, control center, and effector; however, negative feedback loops work to prevent an excessive response to the stimulus, whereas positive feedback loops intensify the response until an end point is reached.</p>

            <p id="auto_17e4eea8-a005-45af-b835-f756a014cd48_fs-id2103934">Ancient Greek and Latin words are used to build anatomical terms. A standard reference position for mapping the body&#x2019;s structures is the normal anatomical position. Regions of the body are identified using terms such as &#x201C;occipital&#x201D; that are more precise than common words and phrases such as &#x201C;the back of the head.&#x201D; Directional terms such as anterior and posterior are essential for accurately describing the relative locations of body structures. Images of the body&#x2019;s interior commonly align along one of three planes: the sagittal, frontal, or transverse. The body&#x2019;s organs are organized in one of two main cavities&#x2014;dorsal (also referred to posterior) and ventral (also referred to anterior)&#x2014;which are further sub-divided according to the structures present in each area. The serous membranes have two layers&#x2014;parietal and visceral&#x2014;surrounding a fluid filled space. Serous membranes cover the lungs (pleural serosa), heart (pericardial serosa), and some abdominopelvic organs (peritoneal serosa).</p>

            <p id="auto_bda09c0d-e898-4653-9d37-3cb49fab55e5_fs-id1689506">Detailed anatomical drawings of the human body first became available in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; however, it was not until the end of the nineteenth century, and the discovery of X-rays, that anatomists and physicians discovered non-surgical methods to look inside a living body. Since then, many other techniques, including CT scans, MRI scans, PET scans, and ultrasonography, have been developed, providing more accurate and detailed views of the form and function of the human body.</p>

              <p id="auto_1fb02236-0cf1-424b-a8cd-13e77aabd1fb_fs-id2033651">The smallest, most fundamental material components of the human body are basic chemical elements. In fact, chemicals called nucleotide bases are the foundation of the genetic code with the instructions on how to build and maintain the human body from conception through old age. There are about three billion of these base pairs in human DNA.</p>
              <p id="auto_1fb02236-0cf1-424b-a8cd-13e77aabd1fb_fs-id1478322">Human chemistry includes organic molecules (carbon-based) and biochemicals (those produced by the body). Human chemistry also includes elements. In fact, life cannot exist without many of the elements that are part of the earth. All of the elements that contribute to chemical reactions, to the transformation of energy, and to electrical activity and muscle contraction&#x2014;elements that include phosphorus, carbon, sodium, and calcium, to name a few&#x2014;originated in stars.</p>
              <p id="auto_1fb02236-0cf1-424b-a8cd-13e77aabd1fb_fs-id1406290">These elements, in turn, can form both the inorganic and organic chemical compounds important to life, including, for example, water, glucose, and proteins. This chapter begins by examining elements and how the structures of atoms, the basic units of matter, determine the characteristics of elements by the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in the atoms. The chapter then builds the framework of life from there.</p>

Scientists define matter as anything that occupies space and has mass. An object&#x2019;s mass and its weight are related concepts, but not quite the same. An object&#x2019;s mass is the amount of matter contained in the object, and the object&#x2019;s mass is the same whether that object is on Earth or in the zero-gravity environment of outer space. An object&#x2019;s weight, on the other hand, is its mass as affected by the pull of gravity. Where gravity strongly pulls on an object&#x2019;s mass its weight is greater than it is where gravity is less strong. An object of a certain mass weighs less on the moon, for example, than it does on Earth because the gravity of the moon is less than that of Earth. In other words, weight is variable, and is influenced by gravity. A piece of cheese that weighs a pound on Earth weighs only a few ounces on the moon.</p>

            <h3 data-type="title">Elements and Compounds</h3>
            <p id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fs-id2052014">All matter in the natural world is composed of one or more of the 92 fundamental substances called elements. An <span data-type="term" id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_term-00002" group-by="e">element</span> is a pure substance that is distinguished from all other matter by the fact that it cannot be created or broken down by ordinary chemical means. While your body can assemble many of the chemical compounds needed for life from their constituent elements, it cannot make elements. They must come from the environment. A familiar example of an element that you must take in is calcium (Ca). Calcium is essential to the human body; it is absorbed and used for a number of processes, including strengthening bones. When you consume dairy products your digestive system breaks down the food into components small enough to cross into the bloodstream. Among these is calcium, which, because it is an element, cannot be broken down further. The elemental calcium in cheese, therefore, is the same as the calcium that forms your bones. Some other elements you might be familiar with are oxygen, sodium, and iron. The elements in the human body are shown in <a href="#auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fig-ch02_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.2</a>, beginning with the most abundant: oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). Each element&#x2019;s name can be replaced by a one- or two-letter symbol; you will become familiar with some of these during this course. All the elements in your body are derived from the foods you eat and the air you breathe.</p>

An atom&#x2019;s neutrons have no charge: they are electrically neutral. Just as a magnet sticks to a steel refrigerator because their opposite charges attract, the positively charged protons attract the negatively charged electrons. This mutual attraction gives the atom some structural stability. The attraction by the positively charged nucleus helps keep electrons from straying far. The number of protons and electrons within a neutral atom are equal, thus, the atom&#x2019;s overall charge is balanced.</p>

              <p id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fs-id1962969">An atom of carbon is unique to carbon, but a proton of carbon is not. One proton is the same as another, whether it is found in an atom of carbon, sodium (Na), or iron (Fe). The same is true for neutrons and electrons. So, what gives an element its distinctive properties&#x2014;what makes carbon so different from sodium or iron? The answer is the unique quantity of protons each contains. Carbon by definition is an element whose atoms contain six protons. No other element has exactly six protons in its atoms. Moreover, <em data-effect="italics">all</em> atoms of carbon, whether found in your liver or in a lump of coal, contain six protons. Thus, the <span data-type="term" id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_term-00008" group-by="a">atomic number</span>, which is the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom, identifies the element. Because an atom usually has the same number of electrons as protons, the atomic number identifies the usual number of electrons as well.</p>
              <p id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fs-id2673650">In their most common form, many elements also contain the same number of neutrons as protons. The most common form of carbon, for example, has six neutrons as well as six protons, for a total of 12 subatomic particles in its nucleus. An element&#x2019;s <span data-type="term" id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_term-00009" group-by="m">mass number</span> is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. So the most common form of carbon&#x2019;s mass number is 12. (Electrons have so little mass that they do not appreciably contribute to the mass of an atom.) Carbon is a relatively light element. Uranium (U), in contrast, has a mass number of 238 and is referred to as a heavy metal. Its atomic number is 92 (it has 92 protons) but it contains 146 neutrons; it has the most mass of all the naturally occurring elements.</p>

Different radioactive isotopes (also called radioisotopes) differ in their half-life, the time it takes for half of any size sample of an isotope to decay. For example, the half-life of tritium&#x2014;a radioisotope of hydrogen&#x2014;is about 12 years, indicating it takes 12 years for half of the tritium nuclei in a sample to decay. Excessive exposure to radioactive isotopes can damage human cells and even cause cancer and birth defects, but when exposure is controlled, some radioactive isotopes can be useful in medicine.

The controlled use of radioisotopes has advanced medical diagnosis and treatment of disease. Interventional radiologists are physicians who treat disease by using minimally invasive techniques involving radiation. Many conditions that could once only be treated with a lengthy and traumatic operation can now be treated non-surgically, reducing the cost, pain, length of hospital stay, and recovery time for patients. For example, in the past, the only options for a patient with one or more tumors in the liver were surgery and chemotherapy (the administration of drugs to treat cancer). Some liver tumors, however, are difficult to access surgically, and others could require the surgeon to remove too much of the liver. Moreover, chemotherapy is highly toxic to the liver, and certain tumors do not respond well to it anyway. In some such cases, an interventional radiologist can treat the tumors by disrupting their blood supply, which they need if they are to continue to grow. In this procedure, called radioembolization, the radiologist accesses the liver with a fine needle, threaded through one of the patient&#x2019;s blood vessels. The radiologist then inserts tiny radioactive &#x201C;seeds&#x201D; into the blood vessels that supply the tumors. In the days and weeks following the procedure, the radiation emitted from the seeds destroys the vessels and directly kills the tumor cells in the vicinity of the treatment.</p>

One of the most advanced uses of radioisotopes in medicine is the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, which detects the activity in the body of a very small injection of radioactive glucose, the simple sugar that cells use for energy. The PET camera reveals to the medical team which of the patient&#x2019;s tissues are taking up the most glucose. Thus, the most metabolically active tissues show up as bright &#x201C;hot spots&#x201D; on the images (<a href="#auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fig-ch02_01_05" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.6</a>). PET can reveal some cancerous masses because cancer cells consume glucose at a high rate to fuel their rapid reproduction.</p>

            <p id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fs-id1226607">In the human body, atoms do not exist as independent entities. Rather, they are constantly reacting with other atoms to form and to break down more complex substances. To fully understand anatomy and physiology you must grasp how atoms participate in such reactions. The key is understanding the behavior of electrons.</p>
            <p id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fs-id1391723">Although electrons do not follow rigid orbits a set distance away from the atom&#x2019;s nucleus, they do tend to stay within certain regions of space called electron shells. An <span data-type="term" id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_term-00013" group-by="e">electron shell</span> is a layer of electrons that encircle the nucleus at a distinct energy level.</p>
            <p id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fs-id2603370">The atoms of the elements found in the human body have from one to five electron shells, and all electron shells hold eight electrons except the first shell, which can only hold two. This configuration of electron shells is the same for all atoms. The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom. Hydrogen and helium have just one and two electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice that hydrogen and helium are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just one electron shell (<a href="#auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fig-ch02_01_06" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.7</a>). A second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen and helium.</p>
            <p id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fs-id2070158">Lithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons. Two of these fill the first electron shell, and the third spills over into a second shell. The second electron shell can accommodate as many as eight electrons. Carbon, with its six electrons, entirely fills its first shell, and half-fills its second. With ten electrons, neon (Ne) entirely fills its two electron shells. Again, a look at the periodic table reveals that all of the elements in the second row, from lithium to neon, have just two electron shells. Atoms with more than ten electrons require more than two shells. These elements occupy the third and subsequent rows of the periodic table.</p>

            <p id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fs-id1850994">The factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of electrons in its valence shell. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_term-00014" group-by="v">valence shell</span> is an atom&#x2019;s outermost electron shell. If the valence shell is full, the atom is stable; meaning its electrons are unlikely to be pulled away from the nucleus by the electrical charge of other atoms. If the valence shell is not full, the atom is reactive; meaning it will tend to react with other atoms in ways that make the valence shell full. Consider hydrogen, with its one electron only half-filling its valence shell. This single electron is likely to be drawn into relationships with the atoms of other elements, so that hydrogen&#x2019;s single valence shell can be stabilized.</p>
            <p id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fs-id1616535">All atoms (except hydrogen and helium with their single electron shells) are most stable when there are exactly eight electrons in their valence shell. This principle is referred to as the octet rule, and it states that an atom will give up, gain, or share electrons with another atom so that it ends up with eight electrons in its own valence shell. For example, oxygen, with six electrons in its valence shell, is likely to react with other atoms in a way that results in the addition of two electrons to oxygen&#x2019;s valence shell, bringing the number to eight. When two hydrogen atoms each share their single electron with oxygen, covalent bonds are formed, resulting in a molecule of water, H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
            <p id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fs-id1890709">In nature, atoms of one element tend to join with atoms of other elements in characteristic ways. For example, carbon commonly fills its valence shell by linking up with four atoms of hydrogen. In so doing, the two elements form the simplest of organic molecules, methane, which also is one of the most abundant and stable carbon-containing compounds on Earth. As stated above, another example is water; oxygen needs two electrons to fill its valence shell. It commonly interacts with two atoms of hydrogen, forming H<sub>2</sub>O. Incidentally, the name &#x201C;hydrogen&#x201D; reflects its contribution to water (hydro- = &#x201C;water&#x201D;; -gen = &#x201C;maker&#x201D;). Thus, hydrogen is the &#x201C;water maker.&#x201D;</p>

But do atoms ever actually touch one another? Most physicists would say no, because the negatively charged electrons in their valence shells repel one another. No force within the human body&#x2014;or anywhere in the natural world&#x2014;is strong enough to overcome this electrical repulsion. So when you read about atoms linking together or colliding, bear in mind that the atoms are not merging in a physical sense.</p>

As long as this situation remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates in a chemical reaction that results in the donation or acceptance of one or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or negatively charged. This happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full valence shell, as described previously. This can happen either by gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by giving away electrons to empty a shell that is less than half-full, thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full, valence shell.

It has just one electron in its valence shell. This characteristic makes potassium highly likely to participate in chemical reactions in which it donates one electron. (It is easier for potassium to donate one electron than to gain seven electrons.) The loss will cause the positive charge of potassium&#x2019;s protons to be more influential than the negative charge of potassium&#x2019;s electrons. In other words, the resulting potassium ion will be slightly positive. A potassium ion is written K<sup>+</sup>, indicating that it has lost a single electron. A positively charged ion is known as a <span data-type="term" id="auto_2c60e072-7665-49b9-a2c9-2736b72b533c_term-00005" group-by="c">cation</span>.</p>

Its atomic number is nine, and it has seven electrons in its valence shell. Thus, it is highly likely to bond with other atoms in such a way that fluorine accepts one electron (it is easier for fluorine to gain one electron than to donate seven electrons). When it does, its electrons will outnumber its protons by one, and it will have an overall negative charge. The ionized form of fluorine is called fluoride, and is written as F<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. A negatively charged ion is known as an <span data-type="term" id="auto_2c60e072-7665-49b9-a2c9-2736b72b533c_term-00006" group-by="a">anion</span>.</p>

A cation that has donated two electrons has a net charge of +2. Using magnesium (Mg) as an example, this can be written Mg<sup>++</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. An anion that has accepted two electrons has a net charge of &#x2013;2. The ionic form of selenium (Se), for example, is typically written Se<sup>2&#x2013;</sup>.</p>

Notice that the two covalently bonded atoms typically share just one or two electron pairs, though larger sharings are possible. The important concept to take from this is that in covalent bonds, electrons in the two atoms' overlapping atomic orbitals are shared to fill the valence shells of both atoms, ultimately stabilizing both of the atoms involved. In a single covalent bond, a single electron pair is shared between two atoms, while in a double covalent bond, two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms. There even are triple covalent bonds, where three electron pairs are shared between two atoms.</p>

This explains why &#x201C;table salt,&#x201D; for example, actually is a molecule called a &#x201C;salt&#x201D; in chemistry, which consists of equal numbers of positively-charged sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and negatively-charged chloride (Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup>), dissolves so readily in water, in this case forming dipole-ion bonds between the water and the electrically-charged ions (electrolytes). Water molecules also repel molecules with nonpolar covalent bonds, like fats, lipids, and oils. You can demonstrate this with a simple kitchen experiment: pour a teaspoon of vegetable oil, a compound formed by nonpolar covalent bonds, into a glass of water. Instead of instantly dissolving in the water, the oil forms a distinct bead because the polar water molecules repel the nonpolar oil.</p>

The bonding processes you have learned thus far are anabolic chemical reactions; that is, they form larger molecules from smaller molecules or atoms. But recall that metabolism can proceed in another direction: in catabolic chemical reactions, bonds between components of larger molecules break, releasing smaller molecules or atoms. Both types of reaction involve exchanges not only of matter, but of energy.</p>

In general, <span data-type="term" id="auto_a1979af6-5761-4483-8a50-6ba57729f769_term-00001" group-by="k">kinetic energy</span> is the form of energy powering any type of matter in motion. Imagine you are building a brick wall. The energy it takes to lift and place one brick atop another is kinetic energy&#x2014;the energy matter possesses because of its motion. Once the wall is in place, it stores potential energy. <span data-type="term" id="auto_a1979af6-5761-4483-8a50-6ba57729f769_term-00002" group-by="P">Potential energy</span> is the energy of position, or the energy matter possesses because of the positioning or structure of its components. If the brick wall collapses, the stored potential energy is released as kinetic energy as the bricks fall.</p>
            <p id="auto_a1979af6-5761-4483-8a50-6ba57729f769_fs-id1384002">In the human body, potential energy is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules. <span data-type="term" id="auto_a1979af6-5761-4483-8a50-6ba57729f769_term-00003" group-by="C">Chemical energy</span> is the form of potential energy in which energy is stored in chemical bonds. When those bonds are formed, chemical energy is invested, and when they break, chemical energy is released. Notice that chemical energy, like all energy, is neither created nor destroyed; rather, it is converted from one form to another. When you eat an energy bar before heading out the door for a hike, the honey, nuts, and other foods the bar contains are broken down and rearranged by your body into molecules that your muscle cells convert to kinetic energy.</p>
            <p id="auto_a1979af6-5761-4483-8a50-6ba57729f769_fs-id1583782">Chemical reactions that release more energy than they absorb are characterized as exergonic. The catabolism of the foods in your energy bar is an example. Some of the chemical energy stored in the bar is absorbed into molecules your body uses for fuel, but some of it is released&#x2014;for example, as heat. In contrast, chemical reactions that absorb more energy than they release are endergonic. These reactions require energy input, and the resulting molecule stores not only the chemical energy in the original components, but also the energy that fueled the reaction. Because energy is neither created nor destroyed, where does the energy needed for endergonic reactions come from? In many cases, it comes from exergonic reactions.</p>

              <li>Radiant energy is energy emitted and transmitted as waves rather than matter. These waves vary in length from long radio waves and microwaves to short gamma waves emitted from decaying atomic nuclei. The full spectrum of radiant energy is referred to as the electromagnetic spectrum. The body uses the ultraviolet energy of sunlight to convert a compound in skin cells to vitamin D, which is essential to human functioning. The human eye evolved to see the wavelengths that comprise the colors of the rainbow, from red to violet, so that range in the spectrum is called &#x201C;visible light.&#x201D;</li>

Similarly, there is nothing present in the products that are not present in the reactants.

As in math, chemical equations proceed from left to right, but instead of an equal sign, they employ an arrow or arrows indicating the direction in which the chemical reaction proceeds.

Thus, the greater the surface area of the reactants, the more readily they will interact. When you pop a cube of cheese into your mouth, you chew it before you swallow it. Among other things, chewing increases the surface area of the food so that digestive chemicals can more easily get at it. As a general rule, gases tend to react faster than liquids or solids, again because it takes energy to separate particles of a substance, and gases by definition already have space between their particles. Similarly, the larger the molecule, the greater the number of total bonds, so reactions involving smaller molecules, with fewer total bonds, would be expected to proceed faster.</p>

Reactions that involve highly reactive elements like hydrogen proceed more quickly than reactions that involve less reactive elements.

Recall that kinetic energy is the energy of matter in motion. The kinetic energy of subatomic particles increases in response to increases in thermal energy. The higher the temperature, the faster the particles move, and the more likely they are to come in contact and react.</p>

But as more and more people get up to dance&#x2014;especially if the music is fast&#x2014;collisions are likely to occur. It is the same with chemical reactions: the more particles present within a given space, the more likely those particles are to bump into one another. This means that chemists can speed up chemical reactions not only by increasing the <span data-type="term" id="auto_a1979af6-5761-4483-8a50-6ba57729f769_term-00009" group-by="c">concentration</span> of particles&#x2014;the number of particles in the space&#x2014;but also by decreasing the volume of the space, which would correspondingly increase the pressure. If there were 100 dancers in that club, and the manager abruptly moved the party to a room half the size, the concentration of the dancers would double in the new space, and the likelihood of collisions would increase accordingly.</p>

Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their collision. But in the body, extremely high heat&#x2014;such as a very high fever&#x2014;can damage body cells and be life-threatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that sustain life. That is where catalysts come in.</p>

In the body, water absorbs the heat generated by chemical reactions without greatly increasing in temperature. Moreover, when the environmental temperature soars, the water stored in the body helps keep the body cool. This cooling effect happens as warm blood from the body&#x2019;s core flows to the blood vessels just under the skin and is transferred to the environment. At the same time, sweat glands release warm water in sweat. As the water evaporates into the air, it carries away heat, and then the cooler blood from the periphery circulates back to the body core.</p>

              <p id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_fs-id2157424">A mixture is a combination of two or more substances, each of which maintains its own chemical identity. In other words, the constituent substances are not chemically bonded into a new, larger chemical compound. The concept is easy to imagine if you think of powdery substances such as flour and sugar; when you stir them together in a bowl, they obviously do not bond to form a new compound. The room air you breathe is a gaseous mixture, containing three discrete elements&#x2014;nitrogen, oxygen, and argon&#x2014;and one compound, carbon dioxide. There are three types of liquid mixtures, all of which contain water as a key component. These are solutions, colloids, and suspensions.</p>
              <p id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_fs-id1856926">For cells in the body to survive, they must be kept moist in a water-based liquid called a solution. In chemistry, a liquid <span data-type="term" id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_term-00003" group-by="s">solution</span> consists of a solvent that dissolves a substance called a solute. An important characteristic of solutions is that they are homogeneous; that is, the solute molecules are distributed evenly throughout the solution. If you were to stir a teaspoon of sugar into a glass of water, the sugar would dissolve into sugar molecules separated by water molecules. The ratio of sugar to water in the left side of the glass would be the same as the ratio of sugar to water in the right side of the glass. If you were to add more sugar, the ratio of sugar to water would change, but the distribution&#x2014;provided you had stirred well&#x2014;would still be even.</p>

Water is certainly the most abundant solvent in the body; essentially all of the body&#x2019;s chemical reactions occur among compounds dissolved in water. Because water molecules are polar, with regions of positive and negative electrical charge, water readily dissolves ionic compounds and polar covalent compounds. Such compounds are referred to as hydrophilic, or &#x201C;water-loving.&#x201D; As mentioned above, sugar dissolves well in water. This is because sugar molecules contain regions of hydrogen-oxygen polar bonds, making it hydrophilic. Nonpolar molecules, which do not readily dissolve in water, are called hydrophobic, or &#x201C;water-fearing.&#x201D;</p>

              <p id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_fs-id1218107">Various mixtures of solutes and water are described in chemistry. The concentration of a given solute is the number of particles of that solute in a given space (oxygen makes up about 21 percent of atmospheric air). In the bloodstream of humans, glucose concentration is usually measured in milligram (mg) per deciliter (dL), and in a healthy adult averages about 100 mg/dL. Another method of measuring the concentration of a solute is by its molarity&#x2014;which is moles (M) of the molecules per liter (L). The mole of an element is its atomic weight, while a mole of a compound is the sum of the atomic weights of its components, called the molecular weight. An often-used example is calculating a mole of glucose, with the chemical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. Using the periodic table, the atomic weight of carbon (C) is 12.011 grams (g), and there are six carbons in glucose, for a total atomic weight of 72.066 g. Doing the same calculations for hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O), the molecular weight equals 180.156g (the &#x201C;gram molecular weight&#x201D; of glucose). When water is added to make one liter of solution, you have one mole (1M) of glucose. This is particularly useful in chemistry because of the relationship of moles to &#x201C;Avogadro&#x2019;s number.&#x201D; A mole of any solution has the same number of particles in it: 6.02 &#xD7; 10<sup>23</sup>. Many substances in the bloodstream and other tissue of the body are measured in thousandths of a mole, or millimoles (mM).</p>

The solute particles consist of tiny clumps of molecules large enough to make the liquid mixture opaque (because the particles are large enough to scatter light). Familiar examples of colloids are milk and cream. In the thyroid glands, the thyroid hormone is stored as a thick protein mixture also called a colloid.</p>

This separation of particles from a suspension is called sedimentation. An example of sedimentation occurs in the blood test that establishes sedimentation rate, or sed rate. The test measures how quickly red blood cells in a test tube settle out of the watery portion of blood (known as plasma) over a set period of time. Rapid sedimentation of blood cells does not normally happen in the healthy body, but aspects of certain diseases can cause blood cells to clump together, and these heavy clumps of blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube more quickly than do normal blood cells.</p>

                <li>In dehydration synthesis, one reactant gives up an atom of hydrogen and another reactant gives up a hydroxyl group (OH) in the synthesis of a new product.

            <p id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_fs-id1425179">Recall that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds. In these reactions, one atom gives up one or more electrons, and thus becomes positively charged, whereas the other accepts one or more electrons and becomes negatively charged. You can now define a salt as a substance that, when dissolved in water, dissociates into ions other than H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. This fact is important in distinguishing salts from acids and bases, discussed next.</p>
            <p id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_fs-id2103101">A typical salt, NaCl, dissociates completely in water (<a href="#auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_fig-ch02_04_02" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.15</a>). The positive and negative regions on the water molecule (the hydrogen and oxygen ends respectively) attract the negative chloride and positive sodium ions, pulling them away from each other. Again, whereas nonpolar and polar covalently bonded compounds break apart into molecules in solution, salts dissociate into ions. These ions are electrolytes; they are capable of conducting an electrical current in solution. This property is critical to the function of ions in transmitting nerve impulses and prompting muscle contraction.</p>

Because an atom of hydrogen has just one proton and one electron, a positively charged hydrogen ion is simply a proton. This solitary proton is highly likely to participate in chemical reactions. Strong acids are compounds that release all of their H<sup>+ </sup>in solution; that is, they ionize completely. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is released from cells in the lining of the stomach, is a strong acid because it releases all of its H<sup>+ </sup>in the stomach&#x2019;s watery environment. This strong acid aids in digestion and kills ingested microbes. Weak acids do not ionize completely; that is, some of their hydrogen<sup> </sup>ions<sup> </sup>remain bonded within a compound in solution. An example of a weak acid is vinegar, or acetic acid; it is called acetate after it gives up a proton.</p>

              <p id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_fs-id1358455">The relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution&#x2019;s <span data-type="term" id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_term-00008" group-by="p">pH</span> is the negative, base-10 logarithm of the hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H<sup>+</sup> concentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH scale, like that shown in <a href="#auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_fig-ch02_04_04" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.17</a>. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution with a pH of 7 is considered neutral&#x2014;neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below 7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H<sup>+</sup>. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each pH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10<sup>&#x2013;4</sup> M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10<sup>&#x2013;5</sup> M, or 0.00001M. The higher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H<sup>+</sup>. Human urine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.</p>

              <p id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_fs-id2061621">The pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this slightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) constantly being released into the bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO<sub>2</sub> while breathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations&#x2014;either too acidic or too alkaline&#x2014;can lead to life-threatening disorders.</p>
              <p id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_fs-id1282302">All cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid&#x2013;base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body therefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and the internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_term-00009" group-by="b">buffer</span> is a solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is even a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid&#x2014;in this case, acting as a weak base&#x2014;will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and contribute hydrogen ions.</p>

Excessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations and disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person&#x2019;s ability to exhale fully, which causes a buildup of CO<sub>2</sub> (and H<sup>+</sup>) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the level or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe diarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with poorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of body fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure, liver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.</p>
                  <p id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_fs-id1897513">In contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with acidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low. Lung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the normal concentration of H<sup>+</sup>.</p>
                  <p id="auto_e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1_fs-id2285357">Metabolic alkalosis often results from prolonged, severe vomiting, which causes a loss of hydrogen and chloride ions (as components of HCl). Medications also can prompt alkalosis. These include diuretics that cause the body to lose potassium ions, as well as antacids when taken in excessive amounts, for instance by someone with persistent heartburn or an ulcer.</p>

            <h3 data-type="title">The Chemistry of Carbon</h3>
            <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id2413719">What makes organic compounds ubiquitous is the chemistry of their carbon core. Recall that carbon atoms have four electrons in their valence shell, and that the octet rule dictates that atoms tend to react in such a way as to complete their valence shell with eight electrons. Carbon atoms do not complete their valence shells by donating or accepting four electrons. Instead, they readily share electrons via covalent bonds.</p>
            <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id2338170">Commonly, carbon atoms share with other carbon atoms, often forming a long carbon chain referred to as a carbon skeleton. When they do share, however, they do not share all their electrons exclusively with each other. Rather, carbon atoms tend to share electrons with a variety of other elements, one of which is always hydrogen. Carbon and hydrogen groupings are called hydrocarbons. If you study the figures of organic compounds in the remainder of this chapter, you will see several with chains of hydrocarbons in one region of the compound.</p>
            <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id2069935">Many combinations are possible to fill carbon&#x2019;s four &#x201C;vacancies.&#x201D; Carbon may share electrons with oxygen or nitrogen or other atoms in a particular region of an organic compound. Moreover, the atoms to which carbon atoms bond may also be part of a functional group.

You can think of functional groups as tightly knit &#x201C;cliques&#x201D; whose members are unlikely to be parted. Five functional groups are important in human physiology; these are the hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, methyl and phosphate groups (<a href="#auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_tbl-ch02_01" class="autogenerated-content">Table 2.1</a>).</p>

Polymers are split into monomers by hydrolysis (-lysis = &#x201C;rupture&#x201D;). The bonds between their monomers are broken, via the donation of a molecule of water, which contributes a hydrogen atom to one monomer and a hydroxyl group to the other.</p>

When you are resting or asleep, a majority of the energy used to keep you alive is derived from triglycerides stored in your fat (adipose) tissues. Triglycerides also fuel long, slow physical activity such as gardening or hiking, and contribute a modest percentage of energy for vigorous physical activity. Dietary fat also assists the absorption and transport of the nonpolar fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Additionally, stored body fat protects and cushions the body&#x2019;s bones and internal organs, and acts as insulation to retain body heat.</p>

In fact, phospholipids are similar in structure to triglycerides. However, instead of having three fatty acids, a phospholipid is generated from a diglyceride, a glycerol with just two fatty acid chains (<a href="#auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fig-ch02_05_06" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.23</a>). The third binding site on the glycerol is taken up by the phosphate group, which in turn is attached to a polar &#x201C;head&#x201D; region of the molecule. Recall that triglycerides are nonpolar and hydrophobic. This still holds for the fatty acid portion of a phospholipid compound. However, the head of a phospholipid contains charges on the phosphate groups, as well as on the nitrogen atom. These charges make the phospholipid head hydrophilic. Therefore, phospholipids are said to have hydrophobic tails, containing the neutral fatty acids, and hydrophilic heads, containing the charged phosphate groups and nitrogen atom.</p>

Although both plants and animals synthesize sterols, the type that makes the most important contribution to human structure and function is cholesterol, which is synthesized by the liver in humans and animals and is also present in most animal-based foods. Like other lipids, cholesterol&#x2019;s hydrocarbons make it hydrophobic; however, it has a polar hydroxyl head that is hydrophilic. Cholesterol is an important component of bile acids, compounds that help emulsify dietary fats. In fact, the word root chole- refers to bile. Cholesterol is also a building block of many hormones, signaling molecules that the body releases to regulate processes at distant sites. Finally, like phospholipids, cholesterol molecules are found in the cell membrane, where their hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions help regulate the flow of substances into and out of the cell.</p>

Proteins are also components of many of the body&#x2019;s functional chemicals, including digestive enzymes in the digestive tract, antibodies, the neurotransmitters that neurons use to communicate with other cells, and the peptide-based hormones that regulate certain body functions (for instance, growth hormone). While carbohydrates and lipids are composed of hydrocarbons and oxygen, all proteins also contain nitrogen (N), and many contain sulfur (S), in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>

For this reason, they make excellent buffers, helping the body regulate acid&#x2013;base balance. What distinguishes the 20 amino acids from one another is their variable group, which is referred to as a side chain or an R-group. This group can vary in size and can be polar or nonpolar, giving each amino acid its unique characteristics. For example, the side chains of two amino acids&#x2014;cysteine and methionine&#x2014;contain sulfur. Sulfur does not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way that proteins containing cysteine and methionine are assembled.</p>

A protein&#x2019;s shape is determined, most fundamentally, by the sequence of amino acids of which it is made (<a href="#auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.26</a><strong>a</strong>).

              <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id2242372">Although some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary structures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the polypeptide. The most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. If you were to take a length of string and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see <a href="#auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.26</a><strong>b</strong>). Less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains.</p>
              <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id1707170">The secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the protein&#x2019;s tertiary structure (see <a href="#auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.26</a><strong>c</strong>). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_term-00016" group-by="d">disulfide bond</span> is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see <a href="#auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.26</a><strong>d</strong>). The polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. For instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains.</p>
              <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id1840952">When they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature. <span data-type="term" id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_term-00017" group-by="D">Denaturation</span> is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. Denatured proteins lose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. An everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added.</p>
              <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id2625066">The contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. For example, the long, slender shape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax (lengthen). As another example, bones contain long threads of a protein called collagen that acts as scaffolding upon which bone minerals are deposited. These elongated proteins, called fibrous proteins, are strong and durable and typically hydrophobic.</p>
              <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id1383766">In contrast, globular proteins are globes or spheres that tend to be highly reactive and are hydrophilic. The hemoglobin proteins packed into red blood cells are an example (see <a href="#auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.26</a><strong>d</strong>); however, globular proteins are abundant throughout the body, playing critical roles in most body functions. Enzymes, introduced earlier as protein catalysts, are examples of this. The next section takes a closer look at the action of enzymes.</p>

In a similar way, without enzymes to catalyze chemical reactions, the human body would be nonfunctional. It functions only because enzymes function.</p>
              <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id1861297">Enzymatic reactions&#x2014;chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes&#x2014;begin when substrates bind to the enzyme. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_term-00018" group-by="s">substrate</span> is a reactant in an enzymatic reaction. This occurs on regions of the enzyme known as active sites (<a href="#auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fig-ch02_05_10" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.27</a>). Any given enzyme catalyzes just one type of chemical reaction. This characteristic, called specificity, is due to the fact that a substrate with a particular shape and electrical charge can bind only to an active site corresponding to that substrate.</p>
              <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_eip-0">Due to this jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates, enzymes are known for their specificity. In fact, as an enzyme binds to its substrate(s), the enzyme structure changes slightly to find the best fit between the transition state (a structural intermediate between the substrate and product) and the active site, just as a rubber glove molds to a hand inserted into it. This active-site modification in the presence of substrate, along with the simultaneous formation of the transition state, is called induced fit. Overall, there is a specifically matched enzyme for each substrate and, thus, for each chemical reaction; however, there is some flexibility as well. Some enzymes have the ability to act on several different structurally related substrates.</p>

It is likely that enzymes speed up chemical reactions in part because the enzyme&#x2013;substrate complex undergoes a set of temporary and reversible changes that cause the substrates to be oriented toward each other in an optimal position to facilitate their interaction. This promotes increased reaction speed. The enzyme then releases the product(s), and resumes its original shape. The enzyme is then free to engage in the process again, and will do so as long as substrate remains.</p>

Proteins attract fluid, and a healthy concentration of proteins in the blood, the cells, and the spaces between cells helps ensure a balance of fluids in these various &#x201C;compartments.&#x201D; Moreover, proteins in the cell membrane help to transport electrolytes in and out of the cell, keeping these ions in a healthy balance. Like lipids, proteins can bind with carbohydrates. They can thereby produce glycoproteins or proteoglycans, both of which have many functions in the body.</p>

Humans have almost 22,000 genes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which lose their nuclei during development). These genes carry the genetic code to build one&#x2019;s body, and are unique for each individual except identical twins.</p>

            <p id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fs-id2622904">The human body is composed of elements, the most abundant of which are oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and nitrogen (N). You obtain these elements from the foods you eat and the air you breathe. The smallest unit of an element that retains all of the properties of that element is an atom. But, atoms themselves contain many subatomic particles, the three most important of which are protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles do not vary in quality from one element to another; rather, what gives an element its distinctive identification is the quantity of its protons, called its atomic number. Protons and neutrons contribute nearly all of an atom&#x2019;s mass; the number of protons and neutrons is an element&#x2019;s mass number. Heavier and lighter versions of the same element can occur in nature because these versions have different numbers of neutrons. Different versions of an element are called isotopes.</p>
            <p id="auto_b82d4112-06e7-42bb-bd70-4e83cdfe5df0_fs-id1273662">The tendency of an atom to be stable or to react readily with other atoms is largely due to the behavior of the electrons within the atom&#x2019;s outermost electron shell, called its valence shell. Helium, as well as larger atoms with eight electrons in their valence shell, is unlikely to participate in chemical reactions because they are stable. All other atoms tend to accept, donate, or share electrons in a process that brings the electrons in their valence shell to eight (or in the case of hydrogen, to two).</p>

Ions are charged atoms that form when an atom donates or accepts one or more negatively charged electrons. Cations (ions with a positive charge) are attracted to anions (ions with a negative charge). This attraction is called an ionic bond. In covalent bonds, the participating atoms do not lose or gain electrons, but rather share them. Molecules with nonpolar covalent bonds are electrically balanced, and have a linear three-dimensional shape. Molecules with polar covalent bonds have &#x201C;poles&#x201D;&#x2014;regions of weakly positive and negative charge&#x2014;and have a triangular three-dimensional shape. An atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen form water molecules by means of polar covalent bonds. Hydrogen bonds link hydrogen atoms already participating in polar covalent bonds to anions or electronegative regions of other polar molecules. Hydrogen bonds link water molecules, resulting in the properties of water that are important to living things.</p>

Kinetic energy, the energy of matter in motion, fuels the collisions of atoms, ions, and molecules that are necessary if their old bonds are to break and new ones to form. All molecules store potential energy, which is released when their bonds are broken.</p>
            <p id="auto_a1979af6-5761-4483-8a50-6ba57729f769_fs-id1700226">Four forms of energy essential to human functioning are: chemical energy, which is stored and released as chemical bonds are formed and broken; mechanical energy, which directly powers physical activity; radiant energy, emitted as waves such as in sunlight; and electrical energy, the power of moving electrons.</p>
            <p id="auto_a1979af6-5761-4483-8a50-6ba57729f769_fs-id1882994">Chemical reactions begin with reactants and end with products. Synthesis reactions bond reactants together, a process that requires energy, whereas decomposition reactions break the bonds within a reactant and thereby release energy. In exchange reactions, bonds are both broken and formed, and energy is exchanged.</p>
            <p id="auto_a1979af6-5761-4483-8a50-6ba57729f769_fs-id1470250">The rate at which chemical reactions occur is influenced by several properties of the reactants: temperature, concentration and pressure, and the presence or absence of a catalyst. An enzyme is a catalytic protein that speeds up chemical reactions in the human body.</p>

These compounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain both hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and cushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a byproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a reactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds that, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other than H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>&#x2013;</sup>. In contrast, acids release H<sup>+</sup> in solution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H<sup>+</sup>, thereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).</p>

A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g., from 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease in the concentration of H<sup>+</sup>. In a healthy adult, the pH of blood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control mechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy pH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids and weak bases released when the pH of blood or other body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside of this normal range.</p>

            <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id1865776">Organic compounds essential to human functioning include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic because they contain both carbon and hydrogen. Carbon atoms in organic compounds readily share electrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually oxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also may bond with one or more functional groups such as carboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates. Monomers are single units of organic compounds. They bond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which can in turn be broken by hydrolysis.</p>
            <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id2347482">Carbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel. Their structural forms include monosaccharides such as glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and polysaccharides, including starches (polymers of glucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and fiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel. It is converted via an oxidation-reduction reaction to ATP.</p>
            <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id1645046">Lipids are hydrophobic compounds that provide body fuel and are important components of many biological compounds. Triglycerides are the most abundant lipid in the body, and are composed of a glycerol backbone attached to three fatty acid chains. Phospholipids are compounds composed of a diglyceride with a phosphate group attached at the molecule&#x2019;s head. The result is a molecule with polar and nonpolar regions. Steroids are lipids formed of four hydrocarbon rings. The most important is cholesterol. Prostaglandins are signaling molecules derived from unsaturated fatty acids.</p>
            <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id2336120">Proteins are critical components of all body tissues. They are made up of monomers called amino acids, which contain nitrogen, joined by peptide bonds. Protein shape is critical to its function. Most body proteins are globular. An example is enzymes, which catalyze chemical reactions.</p>
            <p id="auto_6773536c-3efb-44c9-8ace-78fafdce27e1_fs-id2450246">Nucleotides are compounds with three building blocks: one or more phosphate groups, a pentose sugar, and a nitrogen-containing base. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids that function in protein synthesis. ATP is the body&#x2019;s fundamental molecule of energy transfer. Removal or addition of phosphates releases or invests energy.</p>

              <p id="auto_296b38a8-ec0c-464a-aa91-21fa71ada02b_fs-id1051549">You developed from a single fertilized egg cell into the complex organism containing trillions of cells that you see when you look in a mirror. During this developmental process, early, undifferentiated cells differentiate and become specialized in their structure and function. These different cell types form specialized tissues that work in concert to perform all of the functions necessary for the living organism. Cellular and developmental biologists study how the continued division of a single cell leads to such complexity and differentiation.</p>
              <p id="auto_296b38a8-ec0c-464a-aa91-21fa71ada02b_fs-id1955807">Consider the difference between a structural cell in the skin and a nerve cell. A structural skin cell may be shaped like a flat plate (squamous) and live only for a short time before it is shed and replaced. Packed tightly into rows and sheets, the squamous skin cells provide a protective barrier for the cells and tissues that lie beneath. A nerve cell, on the other hand, may be shaped something like a star, sending out long processes up to a meter in length and may live for the entire lifetime of the organism. With their long winding appendages, nerve cells can communicate with one another and with other types of body cells and send rapid signals that inform the organism about its environment and allow it to interact with that environment. These differences illustrate one very important theme that is consistent at all organizational levels of biology: the form of a structure is optimally suited to perform particular functions assigned to that structure. Keep this theme in mind as you tour the inside of a cell and are introduced to the various types of cells in the body.</p>
              <p id="auto_296b38a8-ec0c-464a-aa91-21fa71ada02b_fs-id1530911">A primary responsibility of each cell is to contribute to homeostasis. Homeostasis is a term used in biology that refers to a dynamic state of balance within parameters that are compatible with life. For example, living cells require a water-based environment to survive in, and there are various physical (anatomical) and physiological mechanisms that keep all of the trillions of living cells in the human body moist. This is one aspect of homeostasis. When a particular parameter, such as blood pressure or blood oxygen content, moves far enough <em data-effect="italics">out</em> of homeostasis (generally becoming too high or too low), illness or disease&#x2014;and sometimes death&#x2014;inevitably results.</p>
              <p id="auto_296b38a8-ec0c-464a-aa91-21fa71ada02b_fs-id1690280">The concept of a cell started with microscopic observations of dead cork tissue by scientist Robert Hooke in 1665. Without realizing their function or importance, Hook coined the term &#x201C;cell&#x201D; based on the resemblance of the small subdivisions in the cork to the rooms that monks inhabited, called cells. About ten years later, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek became the first person to observe living and moving cells under a microscope. In the century that followed, the theory that cells represented the basic unit of life would develop. These tiny fluid-filled sacs house components responsible for the thousands of biochemical reactions necessary for an organism to grow and survive. In this chapter, you will learn about the major components and functions of a prototypical, generalized cell and discover some of the different types of cells in the human body.</p>

Cholesterol is also present, which contributes to the fluidity of the membrane, and there are various proteins embedded within the membrane that have a variety of functions.</p>
            <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fs-id1524241">A single phospholipid molecule has a phosphate group on one end, called the &#x201C;head,&#x201D; and two side-by-side chains of fatty acids that make up the lipid tails (<a href="#auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fig-ch03_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.2</a>).

Some lipid tails consist of saturated fatty acids and some contain unsaturated fatty acids. This combination adds to the fluidity of the tails that are constantly in motion.

            <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fs-id1332770">One of the great wonders of the cell membrane is its ability to regulate the concentration of substances inside the cell. These substances include ions such as Ca<sup>++</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup>; nutrients including sugars, fatty acids, and amino acids; and waste products, particularly carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), which must leave the cell.</p>
            <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fs-id1667456">The membrane&#x2019;s lipid bilayer structure provides the first level of control. The phospholipids are tightly packed together, and the membrane has a hydrophobic interior. This structure causes the membrane to be selectively permeable. A membrane that has <span data-type="term" id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_term-00015" group-by="s">selective permeability</span> allows only substances meeting certain criteria to pass through it unaided. In the case of the cell membrane, only relatively small, nonpolar materials can move through the lipid bilayer (remember, the lipid tails of the membrane are nonpolar). Some examples of these are other lipids, oxygen and carbon dioxide gases, and alcohol. However, water-soluble materials&#x2014;like glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes&#x2014;need some assistance to cross the membrane because they are repelled by the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipid bilayer. All substances that move through the membrane do so by one of two general methods, which are categorized based on whether or not energy is required. <span data-type="term" id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_term-00016" group-by="P">Passive transport</span> is the movement of substances across the membrane without the expenditure of cellular energy.

A <span data-type="term" id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_term-00018" group-by="c">concentration gradient</span> is the difference in concentration of a substance across a space. Molecules (or ions) will spread/diffuse from where they are more concentrated to where they are less concentrated until they are equally distributed in that space. (When molecules move in this way, they are said to move<em data-effect="italics"> down</em> their concentration gradient.) <span data-type="term" id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_term-00019" group-by="D">Diffusion</span> is the movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. A couple of common examples will help to illustrate this concept. Imagine being inside a closed bathroom. If a bottle of perfume were sprayed, the scent molecules would naturally diffuse from the spot where they left the bottle to all corners of the bathroom, and this diffusion would go on until no more concentration gradient remains. Another example is a spoonful of sugar placed in a cup of tea. Eventually the sugar will diffuse throughout the tea until no concentration gradient remains. In both cases, if the room is warmer or the tea hotter, diffusion occurs even faster as the molecules are bumping into each other and spreading out faster than at cooler temperatures. Having an internal body temperature around 98.6<sup>&#xB0; </sup>F thus also aids in diffusion of particles within the body.</p>

              <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fs-id1502280">Whenever a substance exists in greater concentration on one side of a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell membranes, any substance that can move down its concentration gradient across the membrane will do so. Consider substances that can easily diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, such as the gases oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and CO<sub>2</sub>. O<sub>2</sub> generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO<sub>2</sub> typically diffuses out of cells because it is more concentrated inside of them. Neither of these examples requires any energy on the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane.</p>
              <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fs-id1212990">Before moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use up oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O<sub>2</sub> inside the cell than outside. As a result, oxygen will diffuse from the interstitial fluid directly through the lipid bilayer of the membrane and into the cytoplasm within the cell. On the other hand, because cells produce CO<sub>2</sub> as a byproduct of metabolism, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations rise within the cytoplasm; therefore, CO<sub>2</sub> will move from the cell through the lipid bilayer and into the interstitial fluid, where its concentration is lower. This mechanism of molecules moving across a cell membrane from the side where they are more concentrated to the side where they are less concentrated is a form of passive transport called simple diffusion (<a href="#auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fig-ch03_01_04" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.5</a>).</p>

Solutes dissolved in water on either side of the cell membrane will tend to diffuse down their concentration gradients, but because most substances cannot pass freely through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, their movement is restricted to protein channels and specialized transport mechanisms in the membrane. <span data-type="term" id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_term-00020" group-by="F">Facilitated diffusion</span> is the diffusion process used for those substances that cannot cross the lipid bilayer due to their size, charge, and/or polarity (<a href="#auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fig-ch03_01_05" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.6</a>).

Their diffusion is facilitated by membrane proteins that form sodium channels (or &#x201C;pores&#x201D;), so that Na<sup>+</sup> ions can move down their concentration gradient from outside the cells to inside the cells. There are many other solutes that must undergo facilitated diffusion to move into a cell, such as amino acids, or to move out of a cell, such as wastes. Because facilitated diffusion is a passive process, it does not require energy expenditure by the cell.</p>

Unlike diffusion of a substance from where it is more concentrated to less concentrated, filtration uses a hydrostatic pressure gradient that pushes the fluid&#x2014;and the solutes within it&#x2014;from a higher pressure area to a lower pressure area. Filtration is an extremely important process in the body. For example, the circulatory system uses filtration to move plasma and substances across the endothelial lining of capillaries and into surrounding tissues, supplying cells with the nutrients. Filtration pressure in the kidneys provides the mechanism to remove wastes from the bloodstream.</p>

              <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fs-id1666810">For all of the transport methods described above, the cell expends no energy. Membrane proteins that aid in the passive transport of substances do so without the use of ATP. During active transport, ATP is required to move a substance across a membrane, often with the help of protein carriers, and usually <em data-effect="italics">against</em> its concentration gradient.</p>
              <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fs-id1465738">One of the most common types of active transport involves proteins that serve as pumps. The word &#x201C;pump&#x201D; probably conjures up thoughts of using energy to pump up the tire of a bicycle or a basketball. Similarly, energy from ATP is required for these membrane proteins to transport substances&#x2014;molecules or ions&#x2014;across the membrane, usually against their concentration gradients (from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration).</p>

An <span data-type="term" id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_term-00026" group-by="e">electrical gradient</span> is a difference in electrical charge across a space. In the case of nerve cells, for example, the electrical gradient exists between the inside and outside of the cell, with the inside being negatively-charged (at around -70 mV) relative to the outside. The negative electrical gradient is maintained because each Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump moves three Na<sup>+</sup> ions out of the cell and two K<sup>+</sup> ions into the cell for each ATP molecule that is used (<a href="#auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fig-ch03_01_08" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.9</a>).

              <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_eip-152">Active transport pumps can also work together with other active or passive transport systems to move substances across the membrane. For example, the sodium-potassium pump maintains a high concentration of sodium ions outside of the cell. Therefore, if the cell needs sodium ions, all it has to do is open a passive sodium channel, as the concentration gradient of the sodium ions will drive them to diffuse into the cell. In this way, the action of an active transport pump (the sodium-potassium pump) powers the passive transport of sodium ions by creating a concentration gradient. When active transport powers the transport of another substance in this way, it is called secondary active transport.</p>
              <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_eip-214">Symporters are secondary active transporters that move two substances in the same direction. For example, the sodium-glucose symporter uses sodium ions to &#x201C;pull&#x201D; glucose molecules into the cell. Because cells store glucose for energy, glucose is typically at a higher concentration inside of the cell than outside. However, due to the action of the sodium-potassium pump, sodium ions will easily diffuse into the cell when the symporter is opened. The flood of sodium ions through the symporter provides the energy that allows glucose to move through the symporter and into the cell, against its concentration gradient.</p>
              <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_eip-677">Conversely, antiporters are secondary active transport systems that transport substances in opposite directions. For example, the sodium-hydrogen ion antiporter uses the energy from the inward flood of sodium ions to move hydrogen ions (H+) out of the cell. The sodium-hydrogen antiporter is used to maintain the pH of the cell's interior.</p>

The genetic disease is most well known for its damage to the lungs, causing breathing difficulties and chronic lung infections, but it also affects the liver, pancreas, and intestines. Only about 50 years ago, the prognosis for children born with CF was very grim&#x2014;a life expectancy rarely over 10 years. Today, with advances in medical treatment, many CF patients live into their 30s.</p>
                  <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fs-id1495301">The symptoms of CF result from a malfunctioning membrane ion channel called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. In healthy people, the CFTR protein is an integral membrane protein that transports Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> ions out of the cell. In a person who has CF, the gene for the CFTR is mutated, thus, the cell manufactures a defective channel protein that typically is not incorporated into the membrane, but is instead degraded by the cell.</p>
                  <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fs-id1272771">The CFTR requires ATP in order to function, making its Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> transport a form of active transport. This characteristic puzzled researchers for a long time because the Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> ions are actually flowing <em data-effect="italics">down</em> their concentration gradient when transported out of cells. Active transport generally pumps ions <em data-effect="italics">against</em> their concentration gradient, but the CFTR presents an exception to this rule.</p>
                  <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fs-id1113454">In normal lung tissue, the movement of Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> out of the cell maintains a Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup>-rich, negatively charged environment immediately outside of the cell. This is particularly important in the epithelial lining of the respiratory system. Respiratory epithelial cells secrete mucus, which serves to trap dust, bacteria, and other debris. A cilium (plural = cilia) is one of the hair-like appendages found on certain cells. Cilia on the epithelial cells move the mucus and its trapped particles up the airways away from the lungs and toward the outside. In order to be effectively moved upward, the mucus cannot be too viscous; rather it must have a thin, watery consistency. The transport of Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> and the maintenance of an electronegative environment outside of the cell attract positive ions such as Na<sup>+</sup> to the extracellular space. The accumulation of both Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the extracellular space creates solute-rich mucus, which has a low concentration of water molecules. As a result, through osmosis, water moves from cells and extracellular matrix into the mucus, &#x201C;thinning&#x201D; it out. This is how, in a normal respiratory system, the mucus is kept sufficiently watered-down to be propelled out of the respiratory system.</p>
                  <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fs-id1321541">If the CFTR channel is absent, Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> ions are not transported out of the cell in adequate numbers, thus preventing them from drawing positive ions. The absence of ions in the secreted mucus results in the lack of a normal water concentration gradient. Thus, there is no osmotic pressure pulling water into the mucus. The resulting mucus is thick and sticky, and the ciliated epithelia cannot effectively remove it from the respiratory system. Passageways in the lungs become blocked with mucus, along with the debris it carries. Bacterial infections occur more easily because bacterial cells are not effectively carried away from the lungs.</p>

These two types of ER perform some very different functions and can be found in very different amounts depending on the type of cell. Rough ER (RER) is so-called because its membrane is dotted with embedded granules&#x2014;organelles called ribosomes, giving the RER a bumpy appearance. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_term-00006" group-by="r">ribosome</span> is an organelle that serves as the site of protein synthesis. It is composed of two ribosomal RNA subunits that wrap around mRNA to start the process of translation, followed by protein synthesis. Smooth ER (SER) lacks these ribosomes.</p>
              <p id="auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_fs-id1858545">One of the main functions of the smooth ER is in the synthesis of lipids. The smooth ER synthesizes phospholipids, the main component of biological membranes, as well as steroid hormones. For this reason, cells that produce large quantities of such hormones, such as those of the female ovaries and male testes, contain large amounts of smooth ER. In addition to lipid synthesis, the smooth ER also sequesters (i.e., stores) and regulates the concentration of cellular Ca<sup>++</sup>, a function extremely important in cells of the nervous system where Ca<sup>++</sup> is the trigger for neurotransmitter release. The smooth ER additionally metabolizes some carbohydrates and performs a detoxification role, breaking down certain toxins.</p>
              <p id="auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_fs-id2581786">In contrast with the smooth ER, the primary job of the rough ER is the synthesis and modification of proteins destined for the cell membrane or for export from the cell. For this protein synthesis, many ribosomes attach to the ER (giving it the studded appearance of rough ER). Typically, a protein is synthesized within the ribosome and released inside the channel of the rough ER, where sugars can be added to it (by a process called glycosylation) before it is transported within a vesicle to the next stage in the packaging and shipping process: the Golgi apparatus.</p>

The Golgi apparatus has two distinct sides, each with a different role. One side of the apparatus receives products in vesicles. These products are sorted through the apparatus, and then they are released from the opposite side after being repackaged into new vesicles. If the product is to be exported from the cell, the vesicle migrates to the cell surface and fuses to the cell membrane, and the cargo is secreted (<a href="#auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_fig-ch03_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.15</a>).</p>

Just as you must consume nutrients to provide yourself with energy, so must each of your cells take in nutrients, some of which convert to chemical energy that can be used to power biochemical reactions. Another important function of the cell is detoxification. Humans take in all sorts of toxins from the environment and also produce harmful chemicals as byproducts of cellular processes. Cells called hepatocytes in the liver detoxify many of these toxins.</p>

Mitochondria consist of an outer lipid bilayer membrane as well as an additional inner lipid bilayer membrane (<a href="#auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_fig-ch03_02_04" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.16</a>). The inner membrane is highly folded into winding structures with a great deal of surface area, called cristae. It is along this inner membrane that a series of proteins, enzymes, and other molecules perform the biochemical reactions of cellular respiration. These reactions convert energy stored in nutrient molecules (such as glucose) into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides usable cellular energy to the cell. Cells use ATP constantly, and so the mitochondria are constantly at work. Oxygen molecules are required during cellular respiration, which is why you must constantly breathe it in. One of the organ systems in the body that uses huge amounts of ATP is the muscular system because ATP is required to sustain muscle contraction. As a result, muscle cells are packed full of mitochondria. Nerve cells also need large quantities of ATP to run their sodium-potassium pumps. Therefore, an individual neuron will be loaded with over a thousand mitochondria. On the other hand, a bone cell, which is not nearly as metabolically-active, might only have a couple hundred mitochondria.</p>

Some ROS are important for certain cellular functions, such as cell signaling processes and immune responses against foreign substances. Free radicals are reactive because they contain free unpaired electrons; they can easily oxidize other molecules throughout the cell, causing cellular damage and even cell death. Free radicals are thought to play a role in many destructive processes in the body, from cancer to coronary artery disease.</p>

These byproducts are safely released into the cytoplasm. Like miniature sewage treatment plants, peroxisomes neutralize harmful toxins so that they do not wreak havoc in the cells.

The free radical theory on aging was originally proposed in the 1950s, and still remains under debate. Generally speaking, the free radical theory of aging suggests that accumulated cellular damage from oxidative stress contributes to the physiological and anatomical effects of aging. There are two significantly different versions of this theory: one states that the aging process itself is a result of oxidative damage, and the other states that oxidative damage causes age-related disease and disorders. The latter version of the theory is more widely accepted than the former. However, many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative damage does contribute to the aging process. Research has shown that reducing oxidative damage can result in a longer lifespan in certain organisms such as yeast, worms, and fruit flies. Conversely, increasing oxidative damage can shorten the lifespan of mice and worms. Interestingly, a manipulation called calorie-restriction (moderately restricting the caloric intake) has been shown to increase life span in some laboratory animals. It is believed that this increase is at least in part due to a reduction of oxidative stress. However, a long-term study of primates with calorie-restriction showed no increase in their lifespan. A great deal of additional research will be required to better understand the link between reactive oxygen species and aging.</p>

A <span data-type="term" id="auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_term-00019" group-by="c">centriole</span> can serve as the cellular origin point for microtubules extending outward as cilia or flagella or can assist with the separation of DNA during cell division. Microtubules grow out from the centrioles by adding more tubulin subunits, like adding additional links to a chain.</p>
            <p id="auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_fs-id1493979">In contrast with microtubules, the <span data-type="term" id="auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_term-00020" group-by="m">microfilament</span> is a thinner type of cytoskeletal filament (see <a href="#auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_fig-ch03_02_06" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.18</a><strong>b</strong>). Actin, a protein that forms chains, is the primary component of these microfilaments. Actin fibers, twisted chains of actin filaments, constitute a large component of muscle tissue and, along with the protein myosin, are responsible for muscle contraction. Like microtubules, actin filaments are long chains of single subunits (called actin subunits). In muscle cells, these long actin strands, called thin filaments, are &#x201C;pulled&#x201D; by thick filaments of the myosin protein to contract the cell.</p>
            <p id="auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_fs-id1094713">Actin also has an important role during cell division. When a cell is about to split in half during cell division, actin filaments work with myosin to create a cleavage furrow that eventually splits the cell down the middle, forming two new cells from the original cell.</p>
            <p id="auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_fs-id2259822">The final cytoskeletal filament is the intermediate filament. As its name would suggest, an <span data-type="term" id="auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_term-00021" group-by="i">intermediate filament</span> is a filament intermediate in thickness between the microtubules and microfilaments (see <a href="#auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_fig-ch03_02_06" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.18</a><strong>c</strong>). Intermediate filaments are made up of long fibrous subunits of a protein called keratin that are wound together like the threads that compose a rope. Intermediate filaments, in concert with the microtubules, are important for maintaining cell shape and structure. Unlike the microtubules, which resist compression, intermediate filaments resist tension&#x2014;the forces that pull apart cells. There are many cases in which cells are prone to tension, such as when epithelial cells of the skin are compressed, tugging them in different directions. Intermediate filaments help anchor organelles together within a cell and also link cells to other cells by forming special cell-to-cell junctions.</p>

The nucleus is generally considered the control center of the cell because it stores all of the genetic instructions for manufacturing proteins. Interestingly, some cells in the body, such as muscle cells, contain more than one nucleus (<a href="#auto_f53c4738-3dce-4a11-8560-526c87ab0938_fig-ch03_03_02" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.20</a>), which is known as multinucleated. Other cells, such as mammalian red blood cells (RBCs), do not contain nuclei at all. RBCs eject their nuclei as they mature, making space for the large numbers of hemoglobin molecules that carry oxygen throughout the body (<a href="#auto_f53c4738-3dce-4a11-8560-526c87ab0938_fig-ch03_03_03" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.21</a>).

This information is stored within DNA. The nucleus sends &#x201C;commands&#x201D; to the cell via molecular messengers that translate the information from DNA. Each cell in your body (with the exception of germ cells) contains the complete set of your DNA. When a cell divides, the DNA must be duplicated so that the each new cell receives a full complement of DNA. The following section will explore the structure of the nucleus and its contents, as well as the process of DNA replication.</p>

            <p id="auto_f53c4738-3dce-4a11-8560-526c87ab0938_fs-id729868">In order for an organism to grow, develop, and maintain its health, cells must reproduce themselves by dividing to produce two new daughter cells, each with the full complement of DNA as found in the original cell. Billions of new cells are produced in an adult human every day. Only very few cell types in the body do not divide, including nerve cells, skeletal muscle fibers, and cardiac muscle cells. The division time of different cell types varies. Epithelial cells of the skin and gastrointestinal lining, for instance, divide very frequently to replace those that are constantly being rubbed off of the surface by friction.</p>
            <p id="auto_f53c4738-3dce-4a11-8560-526c87ab0938_fs-id1739073">A DNA molecule is made of two strands that &#x201C;complement&#x201D; each other in the sense that the molecules that compose the strands fit together and bind to each other, creating a double-stranded molecule that looks much like a long, twisted ladder. This double helix can be constructed easily because the two strands are antiparallel, meaning the two strands run in opposite directions. Each side rail of the DNA ladder is composed of alternating sugar and phosphate groups (<a href="#auto_f53c4738-3dce-4a11-8560-526c87ab0938_fig-ch03_03_05" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.23</a>). The two sides of the ladder are not identical, but are complementary. These two backbones are bonded to each other across pairs of protruding bases, each bonded pair forming one &#x201C;rung,&#x201D; or cross member. The four DNA bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). Because of their shape and charge, the two bases that compose a pair always bond together. Adenine always binds with thymine, and cytosine always binds with guanine. The particular sequence of bases along the DNA molecule determines the genetic code. Therefore, if the two complementary strands of DNA were pulled apart, you could infer the order of the bases in one strand from the bases in the other, complementary strand. For example, if one strand has a region with the sequence AGTGCCT, then the sequence of the complementary strand would be TCACGGA.</p>

As you might imagine, it is very important that DNA replication take place precisely so that new cells in the body contain the exact same genetic material as their parent cells. Mistakes made during DNA replication, such as the accidental addition of an inappropriate nucleotide, have the potential to render a gene dysfunctional or useless. Fortunately, there are mechanisms in place to minimize such mistakes. A DNA proofreading process enlists the help of special enzymes that scan the newly synthesized molecule for mistakes and corrects them. Once the process of DNA replication is complete, the cell is ready to divide. You will explore the process of cell division later in the chapter.</p>

          <p id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_fs-id2211531">It was mentioned earlier that DNA provides a &#x201C;blueprint&#x201D; for the cell structure and physiology. This refers to the fact that DNA contains the information necessary for the cell to build one very important type of molecule: the protein. Most structural components of the cell are made up, at least in part, by proteins and virtually all the functions that a cell carries out are completed with the help of proteins. One of the most important classes of proteins is enzymes, which help speed up necessary biochemical reactions that take place inside the cell. Some of these critical biochemical reactions include building larger molecules from smaller components (such as occurs during DNA replication or synthesis of microtubules) and breaking down larger molecules into smaller components (such as when harvesting chemical energy from nutrient molecules). Whatever the cellular process may be, it is almost sure to involve proteins. Just as the cell&#x2019;s genome describes its full complement of DNA, a cell&#x2019;s <span data-type="term" id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_term-00001" group-by="p">proteome</span> is its full complement of proteins. Protein synthesis begins with genes. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_term-00002" group-by="g">gene</span> is a functional segment of DNA that provides the genetic information necessary to build a protein. Each particular gene provides the code necessary to construct a particular protein. <span data-type="term" id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_term-00003" group-by="G">Gene expression</span>, which transforms the information coded in a gene to a final gene product, ultimately dictates the structure and function of a cell by determining which proteins are made.</p>
          <p id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_fs-id1955042">The interpretation of genes works in the following way. Recall that proteins are polymers, or chains, of many amino acid building blocks. The sequence of bases in a gene (that is, its sequence of A, T, C, G nucleotides) translates to an amino acid sequence. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_term-00004" group-by="t">triplet</span> is a section of three DNA bases in a row that codes for a specific amino acid. Similar to the way in which the three-letter code <em data-effect="italics">d-o-g</em> signals the image of a dog, the three-letter DNA base code signals the use of a particular amino acid. For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the amino acid valine. Therefore, a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code to build an entire protein, with multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (<a href="#auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_fig-ch03_04_01" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.25</a>). The mechanism by which cells turn the DNA code into a protein product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.</p>

            <p id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_fs-id1212347">There are several different types of RNA, each having different functions in the cell. The structure of RNA is similar to DNA with a few small exceptions. For one thing, unlike DNA, most types of RNA, including mRNA, are single-stranded and contain no complementary strand. Second, the ribose sugar in RNA contains an additional oxygen atom compared with DNA. Finally, instead of the base thymine, RNA contains the base uracil. This means that adenine will always pair up with uracil during the protein synthesis process.</p>

Transcription begins in a fashion somewhat like DNA replication, in that a region of DNA unwinds and the two strands separate, however, only that small portion of the DNA will be split apart. The triplets within the gene on this section of the DNA molecule are used as the template to transcribe the complementary strand of RNA (<a href="#auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_fig-ch03_04_02" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.26</a>).

Interestingly, some introns that are removed from mRNA are not always non-coding. When different coding regions of mRNA are spliced out, different variations of the protein will eventually result, with differences in structure and function. This process results in a much larger variety of possible proteins and protein functions. When the mRNA transcript is ready, it travels out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm.</p>

Translation requires two major aids: first, a &#x201C;translator,&#x201D; the molecule that will conduct the translation, and second, a substrate on which the mRNA strand is translated into a new protein, like the translator&#x2019;s &#x201C;desk.&#x201D; Both of these requirements are fulfilled by other types of RNA. The substrate on which translation takes place is the ribosome.</p>
            <p id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_fs-id1404772">Remember that many of a cell&#x2019;s ribosomes are found associated with the rough ER, and carry out the synthesis of proteins destined for the Golgi apparatus. <span data-type="term" id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_term-00016" group-by="R">Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)</span> is a type of RNA that, together with proteins, composes the structure of the ribosome. Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm as two distinct components, a small and a large subunit. When an mRNA molecule is ready to be translated, the two subunits come together and attach to the mRNA. The ribosome provides a substrate for translation, bringing together and aligning the mRNA molecule with the molecular &#x201C;translators&#x201D; that must decipher its code.</p>
            <p id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_fs-id1205938">The other major requirement for protein synthesis is the translator molecules that physically &#x201C;read&#x201D; the mRNA codons. <span data-type="term" id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_term-00017" group-by="T">Transfer RNA (tRNA)</span> is a type of RNA that ferries the appropriate corresponding amino acids to the ribosome, and attaches each new amino acid to the last, building the polypeptide chain one-by-one. Thus tRNA transfers specific amino acids from the cytoplasm to a growing polypeptide. The tRNA molecules must be able to recognize the codons on mRNA and match them with the correct amino acid. The tRNA is modified for this function. On one end of its structure is a binding site for a specific amino acid. On the other end is a base sequence that matches the codon specifying its particular amino acid. This sequence of three bases on the tRNA molecule is called an <span data-type="term" id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_term-00018" group-by="a">anticodon</span>. For example, a tRNA responsible for shuttling the amino acid glycine contains a binding site for glycine on one end. On the other end it contains an anticodon that complements the glycine codon (GGA is a codon for glycine, and so the tRNAs anticodon would read CCU). Equipped with its particular cargo and matching anticodon, a tRNA molecule can read its recognized mRNA codon and bring the corresponding amino acid to the growing chain (<a href="#auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_fig-ch03_04_04" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.28</a>).</p>

            <p id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_fs-id1531123">Much like the processes of DNA replication and transcription, translation consists of three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. Initiation takes place with the binding of a ribosome to an mRNA transcript. The elongation stage involves the recognition of a tRNA anticodon with the next mRNA codon in the sequence. Once the anticodon and codon sequences are bound (remember, they are complementary base pairs), the tRNA presents its amino acid cargo and the growing polypeptide strand is attached to this next amino acid. This attachment takes place with the assistance of various enzymes and requires energy. The tRNA molecule then releases the mRNA strand, the mRNA strand shifts one codon over in the ribosome, and the next appropriate tRNA arrives with its matching anticodon. This process continues until the final codon on the mRNA is reached which provides a &#x201C;stop&#x201D; message that signals termination of translation and triggers the release of the complete, newly synthesized protein. Thus, a gene within the DNA molecule is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into a protein product (<a href="#auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_fig-ch03_04_05" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.29</a>).</p>

Cytokinesis then occurs, dividing the cytoplasm and cell body into two new cells. Mitosis is divided into four major stages that take place after interphase (<a href="#auto_ea2a2ecf-4268-4b70-b371-82888c466d47_fig-ch03_05_03" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.32</a>) and in the following order: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.

If the abnormal cells continue to divide unstopped, they can damage the tissues around them, spread to other parts of the body, and eventually result in death. In healthy cells, the tight regulation mechanisms of the cell cycle prevent this from happening, while failures of cell cycle control can cause unwanted and excessive cell division. Failures of control may be caused by inherited genetic abnormalities that compromise the function of certain &#x201C;stop&#x201D; and &#x201C;go&#x201D; signals. Environmental insult that damages DNA can also cause dysfunction in those signals. Often, a combination of both genetic predisposition and environmental factors lead to cancer.</p>

Fortunately, certain cells of the immune system are capable of recognizing cells that have become cancerous and destroying them. However, in certain cases the cancerous cells remain undetected and continue to proliferate. If the resulting tumor does not pose a threat to surrounding tissues, it is said to be benign and can usually be easily removed. If capable of damage, the tumor is considered malignant and the patient is diagnosed with cancer.</p>

Cancer is an extremely complex condition, capable of arising from a wide variety of genetic and environmental causes. Typically, mutations or aberrations in a cell&#x2019;s DNA that compromise normal cell cycle control systems lead to cancerous tumors. Cell cycle control is an example of a homeostatic mechanism that maintains proper cell function and health. While progressing through the phases of the cell cycle, a large variety of intracellular molecules provide stop and go signals to regulate movement forward to the next phase. These signals are maintained in an intricate balance so that the cell only proceeds to the next phase when it is ready. This homeostatic control of the cell cycle can be thought of like a car&#x2019;s cruise control. Cruise control will continually apply just the right amount of acceleration to maintain a desired speed, unless the driver hits the brakes, in which case the car will slow down. Similarly, the cell includes molecular messengers, such as cyclins, that push the cell forward in its cycle.</p>
                  <p id="auto_ea2a2ecf-4268-4b70-b371-82888c466d47_fs-id2192433">In addition to cyclins, a class of proteins that are encoded by genes called proto-oncogenes provide important signals that regulate the cell cycle and move it forward. Examples of proto-oncogene products include cell-surface receptors for growth factors, or cell-signaling molecules, two classes of molecules that can promote DNA replication and cell division. In contrast, a second class of genes known as tumor suppressor genes sends stop signals during a cell cycle. For example, certain protein products of tumor suppressor genes signal potential problems with the DNA and thus stop the cell from dividing, while other proteins signal the cell to die if it is damaged beyond repair. Some tumor suppressor proteins also signal a sufficient surrounding cellular density, which indicates that the cell need not presently divide. The latter function is uniquely important in preventing tumor growth: normal cells exhibit a phenomenon called &#x201C;contact inhibition;&#x201D; thus, extensive cellular contact with neighboring cells causes a signal that stops further cell division.</p>
                  <p id="auto_ea2a2ecf-4268-4b70-b371-82888c466d47_fs-id850869">These two contrasting classes of genes, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, are like the accelerator and brake pedal of the cell&#x2019;s own &#x201C;cruise control system,&#x201D; respectively. Under normal conditions, these stop and go signals are maintained in a homeostatic balance. Generally speaking, there are two ways that the cell&#x2019;s cruise control can lose control: a malfunctioning (overactive) accelerator, or a malfunctioning (underactive) brake. When compromised through a mutation, or otherwise altered, proto-oncogenes can be converted to oncogenes, which produce oncoproteins that push a cell forward in its cycle and stimulate cell division even when it is undesirable to do so. For example, a cell that should be programmed to self-destruct (a process called apoptosis) due to extensive DNA damage might instead be triggered to proliferate by an oncoprotein. On the other hand, a dysfunctional tumor suppressor gene may fail to provide the cell with a necessary stop signal, also resulting in unwanted cell division and proliferation.</p>
                  <p id="auto_ea2a2ecf-4268-4b70-b371-82888c466d47_fs-id1526500">A delicate homeostatic balance between the many proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes delicately controls the cell cycle and ensures that only healthy cells replicate. Therefore, a disruption of this homeostatic balance can cause aberrant cell division and cancerous growths.</p>

One type of adult stem cell is the epithelial stem cell, which gives rise to the keratinocytes in the multiple layers of epithelial cells in the epidermis of skin. Adult bone marrow has three distinct types of stem cells: hematopoietic stem cells, which give rise to red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (<a href="#auto_966c32cc-3d6f-4f4e-af4f-ea0c975e825c_fig-ch03_06_01" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.34</a>); endothelial stem cells, which give rise to the endothelial cell types that line blood and lymph vessels; and mesenchymal stem cells, which give rise to the different types of muscle cells.</p>

Because all cells in the body, beginning with the fertilized egg, contain the same DNA, how do the different cell types come to be so different? The answer is analogous to a movie script. The different actors in a movie all read from the same script, however, they are each only reading their own part of the script. Similarly, all cells contain the same full complement of DNA, but each type of cell only &#x201C;reads&#x201D; the portions of DNA that are relevant to its own function. In biology, this is referred to as the unique genetic expression of each cell.</p>

Stem cell research aims to find ways to use stem cells to regenerate and repair cellular damage. Over time, most adult cells undergo the wear and tear of aging and lose their ability to divide and repair themselves. Stem cells do not display a particular morphology or function. Adult stem cells, which exist as a small subset of cells in most tissues, keep dividing and can differentiate into a number of specialized cells generally formed by that tissue. These cells enable the body to renew and repair body tissues.</p>
                <p id="auto_966c32cc-3d6f-4f4e-af4f-ea0c975e825c_fs-id1534313">The mechanisms that induce a non-differentiated cell to become a specialized cell are poorly understood. In a laboratory setting, it is possible to induce stem cells to differentiate into specialized cells by changing the physical and chemical conditions of growth. Several sources of stem cells are used experimentally and are classified according to their origin and potential for differentiation. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are extracted from embryos and are pluripotent. The adult stem cells that are present in many organs and differentiated tissues, such as bone marrow and skin, are multipotent, being limited in differentiation to the types of cells found in those tissues. The stem cells isolated from umbilical cord blood are also multipotent, as are cells from deciduous teeth (baby teeth). Researchers have recently developed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mouse and human adult stem cells. These cells are genetically reprogrammed multipotent adult cells that function like embryonic stem cells; they are capable of generating cells characteristic of all three germ layers.</p>
                <p id="auto_966c32cc-3d6f-4f4e-af4f-ea0c975e825c_fs-id1532957">Because of their capacity to divide and differentiate into specialized cells, stem cells offer a potential treatment for diseases such as diabetes and heart disease (<a href="#auto_966c32cc-3d6f-4f4e-af4f-ea0c975e825c_fig-ch03_06_03" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.36</a>). Cell-based therapy refers to treatment in which stem cells induced to differentiate in a growth dish are injected into a patient to repair damaged or destroyed cells or tissues. Many obstacles must be overcome for the application of cell-based therapy. Although embryonic stem cells have a nearly unlimited range of differentiation potential, they are seen as foreign by the patient&#x2019;s immune system and may trigger rejection. Also, the destruction of embryos to isolate embryonic stem cells raises considerable ethical and legal questions.</p>

            <p id="auto_ab65fdf7-9137-48d6-b949-5da675cda5e4_fs-id1449977">The cell membrane provides a barrier around the cell, separating its internal components from the extracellular environment. It is composed of a phospholipid bilayer, with hydrophobic internal lipid &#x201C;tails&#x201D; and hydrophilic external phosphate &#x201C;heads.&#x201D; Various membrane proteins are scattered throughout the bilayer, both inserted within it and attached to it peripherally. The cell membrane is selectively permeable, allowing only a limited number of materials to diffuse through its lipid bilayer. All materials that cross the membrane do so using passive (non energy-requiring) or active (energy-requiring) transport processes. During passive transport, materials move by simple diffusion or by facilitated diffusion through the membrane, down their concentration gradient. Water passes through the membrane in a diffusion process called osmosis. During active transport, energy is expended to assist material movement across the membrane in a direction against their concentration gradient. Active transport may take place with the help of protein pumps or through the use of vesicles.</p>

            <p id="auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_fs-id1639757">The internal environmental of a living cell is made up of a fluid, jelly-like substance called cytosol, which consists mainly of water, but also contains various dissolved nutrients and other molecules. The cell contains an array of cellular organelles, each one performing a unique function and helping to maintain the health and activity of the cell. The cytosol and organelles together compose the cell&#x2019;s cytoplasm. Most organelles are surrounded by a lipid membrane similar to the cell membrane of the cell. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes share a functional connectivity and are collectively referred to as the endomembrane system. There are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While the smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid synthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly responsible for protein synthesis using its associated ribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins to the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and packaged for delivery to various locations within or outside of the cell. Some of these protein products are enzymes destined to break down unwanted material and are packaged as lysosomes for use inside the cell.</p>
            <p id="auto_7d5ecac2-a4c4-4167-b952-c3a9bde54252_fs-id1955545">Cells also contain mitochondria and peroxisomes, which are the organelles responsible for producing the cell&#x2019;s energy supply and detoxifying certain chemicals, respectively. Biochemical reactions within mitochondria transform energy-carrying molecules into the usable form of cellular energy known as ATP. Peroxisomes contain enzymes that transform harmful substances such as free radicals into oxygen and water. Cells also contain a miniaturized &#x201C;skeleton&#x201D; of protein filaments that extend throughout its interior. Three different kinds of filaments compose this cytoskeleton (in order of increasing thickness): microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. Each cytoskeletal component performs unique functions as well as provides a supportive framework for the cell.</p>

            <p id="auto_f53c4738-3dce-4a11-8560-526c87ab0938_fs-id1475912">The nucleus is the command center of the cell, containing the genetic instructions for all of the materials a cell will make (and thus all of its functions it can perform). The nucleus is encased within a membrane of two interconnected lipid bilayers, side-by-side. This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-lined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into and out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or more nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome synthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of the cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely contained structure called chromatin within the nucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a variety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to divide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to form chromosomes.</p>
            <p id="auto_f53c4738-3dce-4a11-8560-526c87ab0938_fs-id1967418">There is a pool of cells constantly dividing within your body. The result is billions of new cells being created each day. Before any cell is ready to divide, it must replicate its DNA so that each new daughter cell will receive an exact copy of the organism&#x2019;s genome. A variety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication. These enzymes unwind the DNA molecule, separate the two strands, and assist with the building of complementary strands along each parent strand. The original DNA strands serve as templates from which the nucleotide sequence of the new strands are determined and synthesized. When replication is completed, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each one contains one original strand and one newly synthesized complementary strand.</p>

            <p id="auto_9720dd66-aa78-4811-8a72-9caff10a22b9_fs-id1534841">DNA stores the information necessary for instructing the cell to perform all of its functions. Cells use the genetic code stored within DNA to build proteins, which ultimately determine the structure and function of the cell. This genetic code lies in the particular sequence of nucleotides that make up each gene along the DNA molecule. To &#x201C;read&#x201D; this code, the cell must perform two sequential steps. In the first step, transcription, the DNA code is converted into an RNA code. A molecule of messenger RNA that is complementary to a specific gene is synthesized in a process similar to DNA replication. The molecule of mRNA provides the code to synthesize a protein. In the process of translation, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome. Next, tRNA molecules shuttle the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome, one-by-one, coded by sequential triplet codons on the mRNA, until the protein is fully synthesized. When completed, the mRNA detaches from the ribosome, and the protein is released. Typically, multiple ribosomes attach to a single mRNA molecule at once such that multiple proteins can be manufactured from the mRNA concurrently.</p>

After a cell is born, it passes through an interphase before it is ready to replicate itself and produce daughter cells. This interphase includes two gap phases (G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>), as well as an S phase, during which its DNA is replicated in preparation for cell division. The cell cycle is under precise regulation by chemical messengers both inside and outside the cell that provide &#x201C;stop&#x201D; and &#x201C;go&#x201D; signals for movement from one phase to the next. Failures of these signals can result in cells that continue to divide uncontrollably, which can lead to cancer.</p>
            <p id="auto_ea2a2ecf-4268-4b70-b371-82888c466d47_fs-id1177766">Once a cell has completed interphase and is ready for cell division, it proceeds through four separate stages of mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase). Telophase is followed by the division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis), which generates two daughter cells. This process takes place in all normally dividing cells of the body except for the germ cells that produce eggs and sperm.</p>

            <p id="auto_966c32cc-3d6f-4f4e-af4f-ea0c975e825c_fs-id1072987">One of the major areas of research in biology is that of how cells specialize to assume their unique structures and functions, since all cells essentially originate from a single fertilized egg. Cell differentiation is the process of cells becoming specialized as they body develops. A stem cell is an unspecialized cell that can divide without limit as needed and can, under specific conditions, differentiate into specialized cells. Stem cells are divided into several categories according to their potential to differentiate. While all somatic cells contain the exact same genome, different cell types only express some of those genes at any given time. These differences in gene expression ultimately dictate a cell&#x2019;s unique morphological and physiological characteristics. The primary mechanism that determines which genes will be expressed and which ones will not is through the use of different transcription factor proteins, which bind to DNA and promote or hinder the transcription of different genes. Through the action of these transcription factors, cells specialize into one of hundreds of different cell types in the human body.</p>
