But it is this shift away from a focus on profit that allows them to pursue missions of social improvement and contributions to society as a whole. To be truly effective in a not-for-profit organization, a person must share the organization’s vision.</p>
<p id="auto_1c542225-081d-4076-81d3-3d4abe62f593_fs-idm356169072">The vision for <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Team Rubicon</span> was shaped by its cofounders, Jake Wood and William McNulty, who saw the devastation caused by the Haiti earthquake in 2010 and sprang into action. Both marines, Wood and McNulty knew they could do something to help in this devastating and chaotic situation. Within 24 hours, they enlisted the help of six other military veterans and first responders, gathered donations and supplies from friends and family, and made their way to Haiti to help with disaster relief, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Team Rubicon</span> was born.</p>

</span>

</figure><p id="auto_1c542225-081d-4076-81d3-3d4abe62f593_fs-idm354371568">The organization gets its name from the Rubicon, a river in northern Italy that Julius Caesar and his troops crossed on their epic march to Rome, with the river marking the point of no return. The name underscores the cofounders’ experiences during the Haitian disaster, where despite advice from government officials and other aid organizations not to proceed, their small team crossed into Haiti from the Dominican Republic carrying crucial gear and medical supplies to thousands of earthquake victims.</p>
<p id="auto_1c542225-081d-4076-81d3-3d4abe62f593_fs-idm347809152">Seven years later, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Team Rubicon</span>’s mission is twofold: to pair the skills and experiences of military veterans with first responders to hit the ground running in any type of disaster and to provide a sense of community and accomplishment to veterans who have served their country proudly but may be struggling as a result of their war experiences.</p>
<p id="auto_1c542225-081d-4076-81d3-3d4abe62f593_fs-idm366389120">According to the organization’s mission statement, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Team Rubicon</span> seeks to provide veterans three things they sometimes lose after leaving the military: a purpose, gained through disaster relief; a sense of community, built by serving with others; and a feeling of self-worth from recognizing the impact one individual can make when dealing with natural disasters.</p>
<p id="auto_1c542225-081d-4076-81d3-3d4abe62f593_fs-idm351856816">Headquartered in the Los Angeles area, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Team Rubicon</span> is staffed by more than 60 employees who work in 10 regions around the country, along with more than 40,000 volunteers ready to deploy within 24 hours. Similar to company operations in for-profit organizations, staff positions at <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Team Rubicon</span> include regional administrators; field operations (including membership and training); marketing, communications, and social media; fundraising and partnership development; finance and accounting; and people operations.</p>
<p id="auto_1c542225-081d-4076-81d3-3d4abe62f593_fs-idm358525776"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Team Rubicon</span>’s staff members bring professional and/or military experience to their daily jobs, but they all share the organization’s vision. Many staff members started as volunteers for <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Team Rubicon</span> while working in for-profit careers, while others took advantage of the organization’s strong internship program to become familiar with its mission and focus on disaster relief.</p>
<p id="auto_1c542225-081d-4076-81d3-3d4abe62f593_fs-idm363235312">In 2016, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Team Rubicon</span> trained 8,000 military veterans and first responders in disaster relief and responded to 46 disasters, which required more than 85,000 volunteer hours. In addition to donations from individuals and corporations, Team Rubicon relies on its partnerships with other organizations, such as Southwest Airlines, which supplies hundreds of free plane tickets each year to fly volunteers to disaster sites.</p>
<p id="auto_1c542225-081d-4076-81d3-3d4abe62f593_fs-idm356082656"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Team Rubicon</span> actively engages its nationwide community at every level of the organization, from volunteer to board member, and every step of its operation: from training to planning to implementation to seeking donations and volunteers to help with any type of disaster relief. Over the past several years, Team Rubicon has been recognized as one of the top nonprofits to work for by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis"><em data-effect="italics">The NonProfit Times</em></span>, based on employee surveys and business partners’ input about the organization’s work environment.</p><p id="auto_1c542225-081d-4076-81d3-3d4abe62f593_fs-idm365138256">The not-for-profit world may not be for everyone, but if its growth is any indication within the overall economy, it does appeal to many. With a resolve to assist those in need, including both disaster victims and returning military personnel, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Team Rubicon</span> offers opportunities for those interested in nonprofit careers as well as those passionate about helping others.</p>

It also explores how the world’s economies and governments shape economic activity. Each day in the United States, thousands of new businesses are born. Only a rare few will become the next <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Apple</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Google</span>, or <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Amazon</span>. Unfortunately, many others will never see their first anniversary. The survivors are those that understand that change is the one constant in the business environment. Those organizations pay attention to the business environment in which they operate and the trends that affect all businesses and then successfully adapt to those trends. In this module, we will meet many businesses, both large and small, profit and not-for-profit, that prosper because they track trends and use them to identify potential opportunities. This ability to manage change is a critical factor in separating the success stories from the tales of business failure.</p>

<p id="auto_1c542225-081d-4076-81d3-3d4abe62f593_fs-idm361886368">We begin our study of business by introducing you to the primary functions of a business, the relationship between risk and profits, and the importance of not-for-profit organizations. We’ll also examine the major components of the business environment and how changing demographic, social, political and legal, and competitive factors affect all business organizations. Next, we’ll explore how economies provide jobs for workers and also compete with other businesses to create and deliver products to consumers. You will also learn how governments attempt to influence economic activity through policies such as lowering or raising taxes. Next, we discuss how supply and demand determine prices for goods and services. Finally, we conclude by examining key trends in the business environment, economic systems, and the competitive environment.</p>

<ol id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_bl-002">
<li>How do businesses and not-for-profit organizations help create our standard of living?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm379621376">Take a moment to think about the many different types of businesses you come into contact with on a typical day. As you drive to class, you may stop at a gas station that is part of a major national oil company and grab lunch from a fast food chain such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Taco Bell</span> or <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">McDonald’s</span> or the neighborhood pizza place. Need more cash? You can do your banking on a smartphone or other device via mobile apps. You don’t even have to visit the store anymore: online shopping brings the stores to you, offering everything from clothes to food, furniture, and concert tickets.</p>

<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm372784208">A <span data-type="term">business</span> is an organization that strives for a profit by providing goods and services desired by its customers. Businesses meet the needs of consumers by providing medical care, autos, and countless other goods and services. <span data-type="term">Goods</span> are tangible items manufactured by businesses, such as laptops. <span data-type="term">Services</span> are intangible offerings of businesses that can’t be held, touched, or stored. Physicians, lawyers, hairstylists, car washes, and airlines all provide services. Businesses also serve other organizations, such as hospitals, retailers, and governments, by providing machinery, goods for resale, computers, and thousands of other items.</p>

<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm371198016">Thus, businesses create the goods and services that are the basis of our standard of living. The <span data-type="term">standard of living</span> of any country is measured by the output of goods and services people can buy with the money they have. The United States has one of the highest standards of living in the world. Although several countries, such as Switzerland and Germany, have higher average wages than the United States, their standards of living aren’t higher, because prices are so much higher. As a result, the same amount of money buys less in those countries. For example, in the United States, we can buy an Extra Value Meal at <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">McDonald’s</span> for less than $5, while in another country, a similar meal might cost as much as $10.</p>

<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm373114640">Businesses play a key role in determining our quality of life by providing jobs and goods and services to society. <span data-type="term">Quality of life</span> refers to the general level of human happiness based on such things as life expectancy, educational standards, health, sanitation, and leisure time. Building a high quality of life is a combined effort of businesses, government, and not-for-profit organizations. In 2017, Vienna, Austria, ranked highest in quality of life, followed by Zurich, Switzerland; Auckland, New Zealand; and Munich, Germany. It may come as a surprise that not one of the world’s top cities is in the United States: seven of the top 10 locations are in western Europe, two are in Australia/New Zealand, and one is in Canada. At the other end of the scale, Baghdad, Iraq, is the city scoring the lowest on the annual survey.<a href="#auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_rfin-ch01_1" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_rfin-ch01_1">“Mercer 2017 Quality of Life Rankings,” http://mercer.com/qol, May 15, 2017.</div></a> Creating a quality of life is not without risks, however. <span data-type="term">Risk</span> is the potential to lose time and money or otherwise not be able to accomplish an organization’s goals. Without enough blood donors, for example, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">American Red Cross</span> faces the risk of not meeting the demand for blood by victims of disaster. Businesses such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Microsoft</span> face the risk of falling short of their revenue and profit goals. <span data-type="term">Revenue</span> is the money a company receives by providing services or selling goods to customers. <span data-type="term">Costs</span> are expenses for rent, salaries, supplies, transportation, and many other items that a company incurs from creating and selling goods and services. For example, some of the costs incurred by Microsoft in developing its software include expenses for salaries, facilities, and advertising. If <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Microsoft</span> has money left over after it pays all costs, it has a <span data-type="term">profit</span>. A company whose costs are greater than revenues shows a loss.</p>

<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm380070544">When a company such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Microsoft</span> uses its resources intelligently, it can often increase sales, hold costs down, and earn a profit. Not all companies earn profits, but that is the risk of being in business. In U.S. business today, there is generally a direct relationship between risks and profit: the greater the risks, the greater the potential for profit (or loss). Companies that take too conservative a stance may lose out to more nimble competitors who react quickly to the changing business environment.</p>

<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm371195152">Take <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Sony</span>, for example. The Japanese electronics giant, once a leader with its Walkman music player and Trinitron televisions, steadily lost ground—and profits—over the past two decades to other companies by not embracing new technologies such as the digital music format and flat-panel TV screens. Sony misjudged what the market wanted and stayed with proprietary technologies rather than create cross-platform options for consumers. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Apple</span>, at the time an upstart in personal music devices, quickly grabbed the lion’s share of the digital music market with its iPods and iTunes music streaming service. By 2016, Sony restructured its business portfolio and has experienced substantial success with its PlayStation 4 gaming console and original gaming content.<a href="#auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_rfin-ch01_2" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_rfin-ch01_2">Rob Fahey, “Sony’s Entire Future Now Rests on PlayStation,” http://www.gamesindustry.biz, July 1, 2016.</div></a></p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_bsec-003"><h3 data-type="title">Not-for-Profit Organizations</h3><p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm375000384">Not all organizations strive to make a profit. A <span data-type="term">not-for-profit organization</span> is an organization that exists to achieve some goal other than the usual business goal of profit. Charities such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Habitat for Humanity</span>, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">United Way</span>, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">American Cancer Society</span>, and the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">World Wildlife Fund</span> are not-for-profit organizations, as are most hospitals, zoos, arts organizations, civic groups, and religious organizations. Over the last 20 years, the number of nonprofit organizations—and the employees and volunteers who work for them—has increased considerably. Government is our largest and most pervasive not-for-profit group. In addition, more than 1.5 million nongovernmental not-for-profit entities operate in the United States today and contribute more than $900 billion annually to the U.S. economy.<a href="#auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_rfin-ch01_3" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_rfin-ch01_3">“Quick Facts about Nonprofits,” National Center for Charitable Statistics, http://nccs.urban.org, accessed May 15, 2017; Brice S.

<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm376012224">Like their for-profit counterparts, these groups set goals and require resources to meet those goals. However, their goals are not focused on profits. For example, a not-for-profit organization’s goal might be feeding the poor, preserving the environment, increasing attendance at the ballet, or preventing drunk driving. Not-for-profit organizations do not compete directly with one another in the same manner as, for example, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Ford</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Honda</span>, but they do compete for talented employees, people’s limited volunteer time, and donations.</p>

As discussed in detail in the ethics chapter, for-profit businesses are now addressing social issues. Successful not-for-profits apply business principles to operate more effectively. Not-for-profit managers are concerned with the same concepts as their colleagues in for-profit companies: developing strategy, budgeting carefully, measuring performance, encouraging innovation, improving productivity, demonstrating accountability, and fostering an ethical workplace environment.</p>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm381749312">In addition to pursuing a museum’s artistic goals, for example, top executives manage the administrative and business side of the organization: human resources, finance, and legal concerns. Ticket revenues cover a fraction of the museum’s operating costs, so the director spends a great deal of time seeking major donations and memberships. Today’s museum boards of directors include both art patrons and business executives who want to see sound fiscal decision-making in a not-for-profit setting. Therefore, a museum director must walk a fine line between the institution’s artistic mission and financial policies. According to a survey by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis"><em data-effect="italics">The Economist</em></span>, over the next several years, major art museums will be looking for new directors, as more than a third of the current ones are approaching retirement.<a href="#auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_rfin-ch01_4" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_rfin-ch01_4">Julia Halperin, “As a Generation of Directors Reaches Retirement, Fresh Faces Prepare to Take Over US Museums,” <em data-effect="italics">The Art Newspaper,</em> http://www.russellreynolds.com, June 2, 2015; “Museum Succession in America: Onwards and Upwards,” <em data-effect="italics">The Economist,</em> www.economist.com, May 9, 2015.</div></a></p></section><section data-depth="1" id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_bsec-004"><h3 data-type="title">Factors of Production: The Building Blocks of Business</h3>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm372230576">To provide goods and services, regardless of whether they operate in the for-profit or not-for-profit sector, organizations require inputs in the form of resources called <span data-type="term">factors of production</span>. Four traditional factors of production are common to all productive activity: <em data-effect="italics">natural resources</em>, <em data-effect="italics">labor (human resources)</em>, <em data-effect="italics">capital</em>, and <em data-effect="italics">entrepreneurship</em>. Many experts now include <em data-effect="italics">knowledge</em> as a fifth factor, acknowledging its key role in business success. By using the factors of production efficiently, a company can produce more goods and services with the same resources.</p>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm379247520">Commodities that are useful inputs in their natural state are known as natural resources. They include farmland, forests, mineral and oil deposits, and water. Sometimes natural resources are simply called land, although, as you can see, the term means more than just land. Companies use natural resources in different ways. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">International Paper Company</span> uses wood pulp to make paper, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company</span> may use water, oil, or coal to produce electricity. Today urban sprawl, pollution, and limited resources have raised questions about resource use. Conservationists, environmentalists, and government bodies are proposing laws to require land-use planning and resource conservation.</p>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm381747056">Labor, or human resources, refers to the economic contributions of people working with their minds and muscles. This input includes the talents of everyone—from a restaurant cook to a nuclear physicist—who performs the many tasks of manufacturing and selling goods and services.</p>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm379795216">The tools, machinery, equipment, and buildings used to produce goods and services and get them to the consumer are known as <span data-type="term">capital</span>. Sometimes the term <em data-effect="italics">capital</em> is also used to mean the money that buys machinery, factories, and other production and distribution facilities. However, because money itself produces nothing, it is not one of the basic inputs. Instead, it is a means of acquiring the inputs. Therefore, in this context, capital does not include money.</p>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm381746016"><span data-type="term">Entrepreneurs</span> are the people who combine the inputs of natural resources, labor, and capital to produce goods or services with the intention of making a profit or accomplishing a not-for-profit goal. These people make the decisions that set the course for their businesses; they create products and production processes or develop services. Because they are not guaranteed a profit in return for their time and effort, they must be risk-takers. Of course, if their companies succeed, the rewards may be great.</p>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm381744864">Today, many individuals want to start their own businesses. They are attracted by the opportunity to be their own boss and reap the financial rewards of a successful firm. Many start their first business from their dorm rooms, such as Mark <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Zuckerberg</span> of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Facebook</span>, or while living at home, so their cost is almost zero. Entrepreneurs include people such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Microsoft</span> cofounder Bill <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Gates</span>, who was named the richest person in the world in 2017, as well as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Google</span> founders Sergey <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Brin</span> and Larry <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Page</span>.<a href="#auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_rfin-ch01_5" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_rfin-ch01_5">Kerry A.

John <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Fischer</span> of Longmont, Colorado, fits the profile.</p>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm370745296">The drawn-out U.S. presidential election in 2000 between Bush and Gore inspired Fischer to create a bumper sticker that claimed, “He’s Not My President,” which became a top seller. As a result of this venture, Fischer started an online retail sticker store, which he viewed as possibly the “<span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Amazon</span> of Stickers.” Designing and making stickers in his basement, Fischer’s start-up would eventually become a multimillion-dollar company, recognized in 2017 by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis"><em data-effect="italics">Forbes</em></span> as one of its top 25 small businesses.</p><p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm375185360">The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">StickerGiant</span> online store was successful, supplying everything from sports stickers to ones commemorating rock and roll bands and breweries. By 2011, the business was going strong; however, the entrepreneur decided to do away with the retail store, instead focusing the business on custom orders, which became <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">StickerGiant</span>’s main product.</p>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm381112048">As the company became more successful and added more employees, Fischer once again looked to make some changes. In 2012 he decided to introduce a concept called open-book management, in which he shares the company’s financials with employees at a weekly meeting. Other topics discussed at the meeting include customer comments and feedback, employee concerns, and colleague appreciation for one another. Fischer believes sharing information about the company’s performance (good or bad) not only allows employees to feel part of the operation, but also empowers them to embrace change or suggest ideas that could help the business expand and flourish.</p>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm373001584">Innovation is also visible in the technology <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">StickerGiant</span> uses to create miles and miles of custom stickers (nearly 800 miles of stickers in 2016). The manufacturing process involves digital printing and laser-finishing equipment. Fischer says only five other companies worldwide have the laser-finishing equipment <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">StickerGiant</span> uses as part of its operations. Because of the investment in this high-tech equipment, the company can make custom stickers in large quantities overnight and ship them to customers the next day.</p>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm377196176">This small business continues to evolve with an entrepreneur at the helm who is not afraid of making changes or having fun. In 2016, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">StickerGiant</span> put together Saul the Sticker Ball, a <em data-effect="italics">Guinness World Records</em> winner that weighed in at a whopping 232 pounds. Fischer and his employees created Saul when they collected more than 170,000 stickers that had been lying around the office and decided to put them to good use. With $10 million in annual sales and nearly 40 employees, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">StickerGiant</span> continues to be a successful endeavor for John <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Fischer</span> and his employees almost two decades after <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Fischer</span> created his first sticker.</p>

Despite the fact that many “routine” jobs have been replaced by automation over the last decade or outsourced to other countries, technology has actually created more jobs that require knowledge and cognitive skills.<a href="#auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_rfin-ch01_6" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_rfin-ch01_6">Caroline Beaton, “Why Knowledge Workers Are Bad at Making Decisions,” <em data-effect="italics">Forbes,</em> http://www.forbes.com, January 23, 2017; Josh Zumbrun, “The Rise of Knowledge Workers Is Accelerating Despite the Threat of Automation,” <em data-effect="italics">The Wall Street Journal,</em> http://www.wsj.com, May 4, 2016.</div></a></p>

<li>How do businesses and not-for-profit organizations help create our standard of living?</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm381100640">Businesses attempt to earn a profit by providing goods and services desired by their customers. Not-for-profit organizations, though not striving for a profit, still deliver many needed services for our society. Our standard of living is measured by the output of goods and services. Thus, businesses and not-for-profit organizations help create our standard of living. Our quality of life is not simply the amount of goods and services available for consumers but rather the society’s general level of happiness.</p>
<p id="auto_b97adc9e-9ff7-4e70-8604-09f182019ba5_fs-idm372656768">Economists refer to the building blocks of a business as the factors of production. To produce anything, one must have natural resources, labor (human resources), capital, and entrepreneurship to assemble the resources and manage the business. Today’s competitive business environment is based upon knowledge and learning. The companies that succeed will be those that learn fast, use knowledge efficiently, and develop new insights.</p>

<ol id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_bl-006" start="2">
<li>What are the sectors of the business environment, and how do changes in them influence business decisions?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm377297744">Businesses do not operate in a vacuum but rather in a dynamic environment that has a direct influence on how they operate and whether they will achieve their objectives. This external business environment is composed of numerous outside organizations and forces that we can group into seven key subenvironments, as <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_bfig-003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong> illustrates: economic, political and legal, demographic, social, competitive, global, and technological. Each of these sectors creates a unique set of challenges and opportunities for businesses.</p>

<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm371995392">Business owners and managers have a great deal of control over the internal environment of business, which covers day-to-day decisions. They choose the supplies they purchase, which employees they hire, the products they sell, and where they sell those products. They use their skills and resources to create goods and services that will satisfy existing and prospective customers. However, the external environmental conditions that affect a business are generally beyond the control of management and change constantly. To compete successfully, business owners and managers must continuously study the environment and adapt their businesses accordingly.</p>

<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm371429344">Other forces, such as natural disasters, can also have a major impact on businesses. While still in the rebuilding stage after <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hurricane Katrina</span> hit in 2005, the U.S. Gulf Coast suffered another disaster in April 2010 as a result of an explosion on the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Deepwater Horizon</span> oil-rig, which killed 11 workers and sent more than 3 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. This event, which played out for more than 87 days, severely affected the environment, businesses, tourism, and people’s livelihoods. Global oil conglomerate BP, which was responsible for the oil spill, has spent more than $60 billion in response to the disaster and cleanup. Seven years after the explosion, tourism and other businesses are slowly recovering, although scientists are not certain about the long-term environmental consequences of the oil spill.<a href="#auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_7" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_7">Environmental Defense Fund, “Seven Years Later: What’s Ahead for the Gulf,” http://www.edf.org, accessed May 15, 2017; “Oil Spills Fast Facts,” <em data-effect="italics">CNN,</em> http://www.cnn.com, February 9, 2017; Steven Mufson, “BP’s Big Bill for the World’s Largest Oil Spill Reaches $61.6 Billion,” <em data-effect="italics">Washington Post,</em> https://www.washingtonpost.com, July 14, 2016; Debbie Elliott, “5 Years after BP Oil Spill, Effects Linger and Recovery Is Slow,” <em data-effect="italics">NPR,</em> http://www.npr.org, April 20, 2015.</div></a></p>

</figure><p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm379445008">No one business is large or powerful enough to create major changes in the external environment. Thus, managers are primarily adapters to, rather than agents of, change. Global competition is basically an uncontrollable element in the external environment. In some situations, however, a firm can influence external events through its strategies. For example, major U.S. pharmaceutical companies have been successful in getting the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Food and Drug Administration</span> (FDA) to speed up the approval process for new drugs.<a href="#auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_8" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_8">Melissa Healy, “Speed Up Drug Approvals at FDA?

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_bsec-007"><h3 data-type="title">Economic Influences</h3>
<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm376082432">This category is one of the most important external influences on businesses. Fluctuations in the level of economic activity create business cycles that affect businesses and individuals in many ways. When the economy is growing, for example, unemployment rates are low, and income levels rise. Inflation and interest rates are other areas that change according to economic activity. Through the policies it sets, such as taxes and interest rate levels, a government attempts to stimulate or curtail the level of economic activity. In addition, the forces of supply and demand determine how prices and quantities of goods and services behave in a free market.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_bsec-008"><h3 data-type="title">Political and Legal Influences</h3>
<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm377288544">The political climate of a country is another critical factor for managers to consider in day-to-day business operations. The amount of government activity, the types of laws it passes, and the general political stability of a government are three components of political climate. For example, a multinational company such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">General Electric</span> will evaluate the political climate of a country before deciding to locate a plant there. Is the government stable, or might a coup disrupt the country? How restrictive are the regulations for foreign businesses, including foreign ownership of business property and taxation? Import tariffs, quotas, and export restrictions also must be taken into account.</p>
<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm373217968">In the United States, laws passed by Congress and the many regulatory agencies cover such areas as competition, minimum wages, environmental protection, worker safety, and copyrights and patents. For example, Congress passed the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Telecommunications Act of 1996</span> to deregulate the telecommunications industry. As a result, competition increased and new opportunities arose as traditional boundaries between service providers blurred. Today the dramatic growth in mobile technology has changed the focus of telecommunications, which now faces challenges related to broadband access and speed, content streaming, and much-needed improvements in network infrastructure to address ever-increasing data transmissions.<a href="#auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_10" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_10">“CIO Journal: 2017 Telecommunications Outlook,” <em data-effect="italics">The Wall Street Journal,</em> http://deloitte.wsj.com, March 1, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm372602096">Federal agencies play a significant role in business operations. When <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Pfizer</span> wants to bring a new medication for heart disease to market, it must follow the procedures set by the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Food and Drug Administration</span> for testing and clinical trials and secure FDA approval. Before issuing stock, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Pfizer</span> must register the securities with the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">The Federal Trade Commission</span> will penalize <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Pfizer</span> if its advertisements promoting the drug’s benefits are misleading.

<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm361042752">States and local governments also exert control over businesses—imposing taxes, issuing corporate charters and business licenses, setting zoning ordinances, and similar regulations.

<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm372639424">Demographic factors are an uncontrollable factor in the business environment and extremely important to managers. <span data-type="term">Demography</span> is the study of people’s vital statistics, such as their age, gender, race and ethnicity, and location. Demographics help companies define the markets for their products and also determine the size and composition of the workforce. You’ll encounter demographics as you continue your study of business.</p>
<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm373923280">Demographics are at the heart of many business decisions. Businesses today must deal with the unique shopping preferences of different generations, which each require marketing approaches and goods and services targeted to their needs. For example, the more than 75 million members of the millennial generation were born between 1981 and 1997. In 2017 they surpassed baby boomers as America’s largest generation.<a href="#auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_11" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_11">Richard Fry, “Millennials Overtake Baby Boomers as America’s Largest Generation,” <em data-effect="italics">Pew Research Center,</em> http://www.pewresearch.org, April 25, 2016.</div></a> The marketing impact of millennials continues to be immense. These are technologically savvy and prosperous young people, with hundreds of billions of dollars to spend. And spend they do—freely, even though they haven’t yet reached their peak income and spending years.<a href="#auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_12" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_12">Ashley Lutz, “Everything You Know about Millennial Spending Is about to Change,” <em data-effect="italics">Business Insider,</em> http://www.businessinsider.com, October 1, 2016.</div></a> Other age groups, such as Generation X—people born between 1965 and 1980—and the baby boomers—born between 1946 and 1964—have their own spending patterns. Many boomers nearing retirement have money and are willing to spend it on their health, their comforts, leisure pursuits, and cars. As the population ages, businesses are offering more products that appeal to middle-aged and senior markets.<a href="#auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_13" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_13">Geoff Gross, “5 Ways to Effectively Market to Baby Boomers,” <em data-effect="italics">Entrepreneur,</em> http://www.entrepreneur.com, June 1, 2016.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm379736224">Social factors—our attitudes, values, ethics, and lifestyles—influence what, how, where, and when people purchase products or services. They are difficult to predict, define, and measure because they can be very subjective. They also change as people move through different life stages. People of all ages have a broader range of interests, defying traditional consumer profiles. They also experience a “poverty of time” and seek ways to gain more control over their time. Changing roles have brought more women into the workforce. This development is increasing family incomes, heightening demand for time-saving goods and services, changing family shopping patterns, and impacting individuals’ ability to achieve a work-life balance. In addition, a renewed emphasis on ethical behavior within organizations at all levels of the company has managers and employees alike searching for the right approach when it comes to gender inequality, sexual harassment, and other social behaviors that impact the potential for a business’s continued success.</p>

Fortunately, the management team at <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">H&amp;R Block</span> not only believes in maintaining a strong culture, it also tries to offer flexibility to its more than 70,000 employees and seasonal workers in 12,000 retail offices worldwide.</p>
<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm379202976">Based in Kansas City, Missouri, and built on a culture of providing exceptional customer service, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">H&amp;R Block</span> was recently named the top U.S. business with the best work-life balance by online job search site Indeed. Analyzing more than 10 million company reviews by employees, Indeed researchers identified the top 20 firms with the best work-life balance. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">H&amp;R Block</span> headed the 2017 list, followed by mortgage lender <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Network Capital Funding Corporation</span>, fast food chain <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">In-N-Out Burger</span>, Texas food retailer <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">H-E-B</span>, and health services company <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Kaiser Permanente</span>, among others.</p>
<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm377865344">According to Paul Wolfe, Indeed’s senior vice president of human resources, empathy on the part of organizations is a key factor in helping employees achieve balance. Wolfe says companies that demonstrate empathy and work diligently to provide personal time for all employees tend to take the top spots on the work-life balance list. “Comments we have seen from employee reviews for these companies indicate ‘fair’ and ‘flexible work environments,’” he says. Surprisingly, none of the tech companies known for their generous work perks made the top 20 list in 2017.</p>
<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm373210848">In this 24/7 world, when no one is far from a text or tweet, finding time for both family and work can be difficult, especially in the tax services industry, which is so schedule driven for a good part of the year. Making a commitment to help workers achieve a healthy work-life balance not only helps its employees, but it also helps <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">H&amp;R Block</span> retain workers in a tight labor market where individuals continue to have choices when it comes to where and for whom they want to work.</p>

<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm361055152">The application of technology can stimulate growth under capitalism or any other economic system. <span data-type="term">Technology</span> is the application of science and engineering skills and knowledge to solve production and organizational problems. New equipment and software that improve productivity and reduce costs can be among a company’s most valuable assets. <span data-type="term">Productivity</span> is the amount of goods and services one worker can produce. Our ability as a nation to maintain and build wealth depends in large part on the speed and effectiveness with which we use technology—to invent and adapt more efficient equipment to improve manufacturing productivity, to develop new products, and to process information and make it instantly available across the organization and to suppliers and customers.</p>
<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm373261536">Many U.S. businesses, large and small, use technology to create change, improve efficiencies, and streamline operations. For example, advances in cloud computing provide businesses with the ability to access and store data without running applications or programs housed on a physical computer or server in their offices. Such applications and programs can now be accessed through the internet. Mobile technology allows businesses to communicate with employees, customers, suppliers, and others at the swipe of a tablet or smartphone screen. Robots help businesses automate repetitive tasks that free up workers to focus on more knowledge-based tasks critical to business operations.<a href="#auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_15" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_rfin-ch01_15">“Why Move to the Cloud? 10 Benefits of Cloud Computing,” http://www.salesforce.com, accessed May 15, 2017; Jim Rock, “How Robots Will Reshape the U.S. Economy,” <em data-effect="italics">Tech Crunch,</em> http://techcrunch.com, March 21, 2016.</div></a></p>

<li>What are the sectors of the business environment, and how do changes in them influence business decisions?</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_cabb0f13-a523-475d-9c9c-c8c255fc6d62_fs-idm381919840">The external business environment consists of economic, political and legal, demographic, social, competitive, global, and technological sectors. Managers must understand how the environment is changing and the impact of those changes on the business. When economic activity is strong, unemployment rates are low, and income levels rise. The political environment is shaped by the amount of government intervention in business affairs, the types of laws it passes to regulate both domestic and foreign businesses, and the general political stability of a government. Demographics, or the study of people’s vital statistics, are at the heart of many business decisions. Businesses today must deal with the unique preferences of different generations, each of which requires different marketing approaches and different goods and services. The population is becoming increasingly diverse: currently minorities represent more than 38 percent of the total U.S. population, and that number will continue to increase over the next several decades. Minorities’ buying power has increased significantly as well, and companies are developing products and marketing campaigns that target different ethnic groups. Social factors—our attitudes, values, and lifestyles—influence what, how, where, and when people purchase products. They are difficult to predict, define, and measure because they can be very subjective. They also change as people move through different life stages.</p>

<li>What are the primary features of the world’s economic systems, and how are the three sectors of the U.S. economy linked?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm348381664">A business’s success depends in part on the economic systems of the countries where it is located and where its sells its products. A nation’s <span data-type="term">economic system</span> is the combination of policies, laws, and choices made by its government to establish the systems that determine what goods and services are produced and how they are allocated. <span data-type="term">Economics</span> is the study of how a society uses scarce resources to produce and distribute goods and services. The resources of a person, a firm, or a nation are limited. Hence, economics is the study of choices—what people, firms, or nations choose from among the available resources. Every economy is concerned with what types and amounts of goods and services should be produced, how they should be produced, and for whom. These decisions are made by the marketplace, the government, or both. In the United States, the government and the free-market system together guide the economy.</p>

<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm357678352">You probably know more about economics than you realize.

<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm349266400">The major differentiator among economic systems is whether the government or individuals decide:</p>

<li>How to allocate limited resources—the factors of production—to individuals and organizations to best satisfy unlimited societal needs</li>

Sometimes, as was the case of the former East Germany, the transition to capitalism was painful but fairly quick. In other countries, such as Russia, the movement has been characterized by false starts and backsliding. <span data-type="term">Capitalism</span>, also known as the <em data-effect="italics">private enterprise system</em>, is based on competition in the marketplace and private ownership of the factors of production (resources). In a competitive economic system, a large number of people and businesses buy and sell products freely in the marketplace. In pure capitalism, all the factors of production are owned privately, and the government does not try to set prices or coordinate economic activity.</p>
<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm364003088">A capitalist system guarantees certain economic rights: the right to own property, the right to make a profit, the right to make free choices, and the right to compete. The right to own property is central to capitalism. The main incentive in this system is profit, which encourages entrepreneurship. Profit is also necessary for producing goods and services, building manufacturing plants, paying dividends and taxes, and creating jobs. The freedom to choose whether to become an entrepreneur or to work for someone else means that people have the right to decide what they want to do on the basis of their own drive, interest, and training. The government does not create job quotas for each industry or give people tests to determine what they will do.</p>
<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm353653200">Competition is good for both businesses and consumers in a capitalist system. It leads to better and more diverse products, keeps prices stable, and increases the efficiency of producers. Companies try to produce their goods and services at the lowest possible cost and sell them at the highest possible price. But when profits are high, more businesses enter the market to seek a share of those profits. The resulting competition among companies tends to lower prices. Companies must then find new ways of operating more efficiently if they are to keep making a profit—and stay in business.</p>

<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm347764944">The complete opposite of capitalism is <span data-type="term">communism</span>. In a communist economic system, the government owns virtually all resources and controls all markets. Economic decision-making is centralized: the government, rather than the competitive forces in the marketplace, decides what will be produced, where it will be produced, how much will be produced, where the raw materials and supplies will come from, who will get the output, and what the prices will be. This form of centralized economic system offers little if any choice to a country’s citizens. Early in the 20th century, countries that chose communism, such as the former Soviet Union and China, believed that it would raise their standard of living. In practice, however, the tight controls over most aspects of people’s lives, such as what careers they can choose, where they can work, and what they can buy, led to lower productivity. Workers had no reasons to work harder or produce quality goods, because there were no rewards for excellence. Errors in planning and resource allocation led to shortages of even basic items.</p>
<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm370326688">These factors were among the reasons for the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union into multiple independent nations. Recent reforms in Russia, China, and most of the eastern European nations have moved these economies toward more capitalistic, market-oriented systems. North Korea and Cuba are the best remaining examples of communist economic systems. Time will tell whether Cuba takes small steps toward a market economy now that the United States reestablished diplomatic relations with the island country a few years ago.<a href="#auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_rfin-ch01_16" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_rfin-ch01_16">“What the Future Holds for U.S.–Cuba Relations,” <em data-effect="italics">Knowledge@Wharton,</em> http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu, April 11, 2017.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm334902032"><span data-type="term">Socialism</span> is an economic system in which the basic industries are owned by the government or by the private sector under strong government control. A socialist state controls critical, large-scale industries such as transportation, communications, and utilities. Smaller businesses and those considered less critical, such as retail, may be privately owned. To varying degrees, the state also determines the goals of businesses, the prices and selection of goods, and the rights of workers. Socialist countries typically provide their citizens with a higher level of services, such as health care and unemployment benefits, than do most capitalist countries. As a result, taxes and unemployment may also be higher in socialist countries. For example, in 2017, the top individual tax rate in France was 45 percent, compared to 39.6 percent in the United States. With both countries electing new presidents in 2017, tax cuts were a campaign promise that both President Macron and President Trump took on as part of their overall economic agendas.<a href="#auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_rfin-ch01_17" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_rfin-ch01_17">France Accountants, “French Tax Summary 2017,” http://www.franceaccountants.com, accessed May 15, 2017; “2017 Tax Brackets,” http://www.bankrate.com, accessed May 15, 2017.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm368108048">Pure capitalism and communism are extremes; real-world economies fall somewhere between the two. The U.S. economy leans toward pure capitalism, but it uses government policies to promote economic stability and growth. Also, through policies and laws, the government transfers money to the poor, the unemployed, and the elderly or disabled. American capitalism has produced some very powerful organizations in the form of large corporations, such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">General Motors</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Microsoft</span>. To protect smaller firms and entrepreneurs, the government has passed legislation that requires that the giants compete fairly against weaker competitors.</p>
<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm327388720">Canada, Sweden, and the UK, among others, are also called <span data-type="term">mixed economies</span>; that is, they use more than one economic system. Sometimes, the government is basically socialist and owns basic industries. In Canada, for example, the government owns the communications, transportation, and utilities industries, as well as some of the natural-resource industries. It also provides health care to its citizens. But most other activity is carried on by private enterprise, as in a capitalist system. In 2016, UK citizens voted for Britain to leave the European Union, a move that will take two or more years to finalize. It is too early to tell what impact the Brexit decision will have on the UK economy and other economies around the world.<a href="#auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_rfin-ch01_18" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_rfin-ch01_18">Simon Kennedy, “Brexit Timeline: From the Referendum to Article 50,” <em data-effect="italics">Bloomberg,</em> http://www.bloomberg.com, March 20, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm356257296">The few factors of production owned by the government in a mixed economy include some public lands, the postal service, and some water resources. But the government is extensively involved in the economic system through taxing, spending, and welfare activities. The economy is also mixed in the sense that the country tries to achieve many social goals—income redistribution and retirement pensions, for example—that may not be attempted in purely capitalist systems.</p>

<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm365056000">The state of the economy affects both people and businesses. How you spend your money (or save it) is a personal economic decision. Whether you continue in school and whether you work part-time are also economic decisions. Every business also operates within the economy. Based on their economic expectations, businesses decide what products to produce, how to price them, how many people to employ, how much to pay these employees, how much to expand the business, and so on.</p>
<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm348090048">Economics has two main subareas. <span data-type="term">Macroeconomics</span> is the study of the economy as a whole. It looks at <em data-effect="italics">aggregate</em> data for large groups of people, companies, or products considered as a whole. In contrast, <span data-type="term">microeconomics</span> focuses on individual parts of the economy, such as households or firms.</p>
<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm365404256">Both <em data-effect="italics">macroeconomics</em> and <em data-effect="italics">microeconomics</em> offer a valuable outlook on the economy. For example, Ford might use both to decide whether to introduce a new line of vehicles. The company would consider such macroeconomic factors as the national level of personal income, the unemployment rate, interest rates, fuel costs, and the national level of sales of new vehicles. From a microeconomic viewpoint, Ford would judge consumer demand for new vehicles versus the existing supply, competing models, labor and material costs and availability, and current prices and sales incentives.</p>

Let’s review the exchanges by following the red circle around the inside of the diagram. Households provide inputs (natural resources, labor, capital, entrepreneurship, knowledge) to businesses, which convert these inputs into outputs (goods and services) for consumers. In return, households receive income from rent, wages, interest, and ownership profits (blue circle). Businesses receive revenue from consumer purchases of goods and services.</p>
<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm326926064">The other important exchange in <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_bfig-005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong> takes place between governments (federal, state, and local) and both households and businesses. Governments supply many types of publicly provided goods and services (highways, schools, police, courts, health services, unemployment insurance, social security) that benefit consumers and businesses. Government purchases from businesses also contribute to business revenues. When a construction firm repairs a local stretch of state highway, for example, government pays for the work. As the diagram shows, government receives taxes from households and businesses to complete the flow.</p>
<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm353305664">Changes in one flow affect the others. If government raises taxes, households have less to spend on goods and services. Lower consumer spending causes businesses to reduce production, and economic activity declines; unemployment may rise. In contrast, cutting taxes can stimulate economic activity. Keep the circular flow in mind as we continue our study of economics. The way economic sectors interact will become more evident as we explore macroeconomics and microeconomics.</p>

<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm353440192">Economics is the study of how individuals, businesses, and governments use scarce resources to produce and distribute goods and services. Today there is a global trend toward capitalism. Capitalism, also known as the <em data-effect="italics">private enterprise system,</em> is based upon marketplace competition and private ownership of the factors of production. Competition leads to more diverse goods and services, keeps prices stable, and pushes businesses to become more efficient.</p>
<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm368397024">In a communist economy, the government owns virtually all resources, and economic decision-making is done by central government planning. Governments have generally moved away from communism because it is inefficient and delivers a low standard of living. Socialism is another centralized economic system in which the basic industries are owned by the government or by the private sector under strong government control. Other industries may be privately owned. The state is also somewhat influential in determining the goals of business, the prices and selection of products, and the rights of workers. Most national economies today are a mix of socialism and capitalism.</p>
<p id="auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_fs-idm356012928">The two major areas in economics are macroeconomics, the study of the economy as a whole, and microeconomics, the study of households and firms. The individual, business, and government sectors of the economy are linked by a series of two-way flows. The government provides public goods and services to the other two sectors and receives income in the form of taxes. Changes in one flow affect the other sectors.</p>

<li>How do economic growth, full employment, price stability, and inflation indicate a nation’s economic health?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm364740224">Have you ever looked at <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">CNN</span>’s <em data-effect="italics">Headline News</em> on a mobile device or turned on the radio and heard something like, “Today the Labor Department reported that for the second straight month unemployment declined”? Statements like this are macroeconomic news. Understanding the national economy and how changes in government policies affect households and businesses is a good place to begin our study of economics.</p>

<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm364021872">Let’s look first at macroeconomic goals and how they can be met. The United States and most other countries have three main macroeconomic goals: economic growth, full employment, and price stability. A nation’s economic well-being depends on carefully defining these goals and choosing the best economic policies for achieving them.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_bsec-023"><h3 data-type="title">Striving for Economic Growth</h3>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm353051712">Perhaps the most important way to judge a nation’s economic health is to look at its production of goods and services. The more the nation produces, the higher its standard of living. An increase in a nation’s output of goods and services is <span data-type="term">economic growth</span>.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm348688480">The most basic measure of economic growth is the <span data-type="term">gross domestic product (GDP)</span>. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a nation’s borders each year. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> publishes quarterly GDP figures that can be used to compare trends in national output. When GDP rises, the economy is growing.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm365145696">The rate of growth in real GDP (GDP adjusted for inflation) is also important. Recently, the U.S. economy has been growing at a slow but steady rate of between 3 and 4 percent annually. This growth rate has meant a steady increase in the output of goods and services and relatively low unemployment. When the growth rate slides toward zero, the economy begins to stagnate and decline.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm363223120">One country that continues to grow more rapidly than most is China, whose GDP has been growing at 6 to 7 percent per year. Today few things in the global marketplace are not or cannot be made in China. The primary contributor to China’s rapid growth has been technology. For example, most tablets and laptops are manufactured in China.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm355987584">The level of economic activity is constantly changing. These upward and downward changes are called <span data-type="term">business cycles</span>. Business cycles vary in length, in how high or low the economy moves, and in how much the economy is affected. Changes in GDP trace the patterns as economic activity expands and contracts. An increase in business activity results in rising output, income, employment, and prices. Eventually, these all peak, and output, income, and employment decline. A decline in GDP that lasts for two consecutive quarters (each a three-month period) is called a <span data-type="term">recession</span>. It is followed by a recovery period when economic activity once again increases. The most recent recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm365664208">Businesses must monitor and react to the changing phases of business cycles. When the economy is growing, companies often have a difficult time hiring good employees and finding scarce supplies and raw materials. When a recession hits, many firms find they have more capacity than the demand for their goods and services requires. During the most recent recession, many businesses operated at substantially lower than capacity. When plants use only part of their capacity, they operate inefficiently and have higher costs per unit produced. Let’s say that <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Mars Corp</span>. has a huge plant that can produce one million Milky Way candy bars a day, but because of a recession Mars can sell only half a million candy bars a day. The plant uses large, expensive machines. Producing Milky Ways at 50 percent capacity does not efficiently utilize Mars’s investment in its plant and equipment.</p>

<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm367876192">Another macroeconomic goal is <span data-type="term">full employment</span>, or having jobs for all who want to and can work. Full employment doesn’t actually mean 100 percent employment. Some people choose not to work for personal reasons (attending school, raising children) or are temporarily unemployed while they wait to start a new job. Thus, the government defines full employment as the situation when about 94 to 96 percent of those available to work actually have jobs. During the 2007–2009 recession in the United States, the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in October 2009. Today, that rate hovers at about 4 percent.<a href="#auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_rfin-ch01_19" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_rfin-ch01_19">Maggie McGrath, “Unemployment Rate Holds Steady at 4.1% as U.S. Adds 148,000 Jobs in December,” <em data-effect="italics">Forbes,</em> https://www.forbes.com, January 5, 2018; Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Spotlight on Statistics: The Recession of 2007–2009,” http://www.bls.gov/spotlight, accessed May 15, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm370047728">Maintaining low unemployment levels is of concern not just to the United States but also to countries around the world. For example, high youth unemployment rates (for workers 25 years of age and younger) in Spain, Italy, and Greece continue to cause protests in these European countries as elected officials struggle with how to turn around their respective economies and put more people, particularly young people, back to work. The UK’s impending exit from the European Union may also have an effect on unemployment rates, as global companies move jobs out of Britain to central European countries such as Poland.<a href="#auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_rfin-ch01_20" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_rfin-ch01_20">Marcus Bensasson, “Youth Unemployment Shows Euro-Area Recovery Not Working for All,” <em data-effect="italics">Bloomberg Markets,</em> http://www.bloomberg.com, April 3, 2017; Dorota Bartyzel and Konrad Krasuski, “Brexit Flight to Shift 30,000 Jobs to Poland, Minister Says,” <em data-effect="italics">Bloomberg Politics,</em> http://www.bloomberg.com, January 23, 2017.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm369974256">To determine how close we are to full employment, the government measures the <span data-type="term">unemployment rate</span>.

<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm367220272">Economists classify unemployment into four types: frictional, structural, cyclical, and seasonal. The categories are of small consolation to someone who is unemployed, but they help economists understand the problem of unemployment in our economy.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm347129424"><span data-type="term">Frictional unemployment</span> is short-term unemployment that is not related to the business cycle. It includes people who are unemployed while waiting to start a better job, those who are reentering the job market, and those entering for the first time, such as new college graduates. This type of unemployment is always present and has little impact on the economy.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm358918512"><span data-type="term">Structural unemployment</span> is also unrelated to the business cycle but is involuntary. It is caused by a mismatch between available jobs and the skills of available workers in an industry or a region. For example, if the birthrate declines, fewer teachers will be needed. Or the available workers in an area may lack the skills that employers want. Retraining and skill-building programs are often required to reduce structural unemployment.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm351315120"><span data-type="term">Cyclical unemployment</span>, as the name implies, occurs when a downturn in the business cycle reduces the demand for labor throughout the economy. In a long recession, cyclical unemployment is widespread, and even people with good job skills can’t find jobs. The government can partly counteract cyclical unemployment with programs that boost the economy.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm369980224">In the past, cyclical unemployment affected mainly less-skilled workers and those in heavy manufacturing. Typically, they would be rehired when economic growth increased. Since the 1990s, however, competition has forced many American companies to downsize so they can survive in the global marketplace. These job reductions affected workers in all categories, including middle management and other salaried positions. Firms continue to reevaluate workforce requirements and downsize to stay competitive to compete with Asian, European, and other U.S. firms. After a strong rebound from the global recession of 2007–2009, when the auto industry slashed more than 200,000 hourly and salaried workers from their payrolls, the automakers are now taking another close look at the size of their global workforces. For example, as sales steadily rose after the recession, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Ford Motor Company</span>’s workforce in North America increased by 25 percent over the past five years. As car sales plateaued in 2017, the company recently announced it would cut approximately 10 percent of its global workforce in an effort to reduce costs, boost profits, and increase its stock value for shareholders.<a href="#auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_rfin-ch01_21" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_rfin-ch01_21">Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Employees in Motor Vehicle and Parts Industry,” https://data.bls.gov, data extracted on May 19, 2017; Christina Rogers, “Ford Aims to Cut Global Workforce by Roughly 10%,” <em data-effect="italics">The Wall Street Journal,</em> http://www.wsj.com, May 15, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm367973248">The last type is <span data-type="term">seasonal unemployment</span>, which occurs during specific times of the year in certain industries. Employees subject to seasonal unemployment include retail workers hired for the holiday shopping season, lettuce pickers in California, and restaurant employees in ski country during the summer.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_bsec-027"><h3 data-type="title">Keeping Prices Steady</h3><p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm366456848">The third macroeconomic goal is to keep overall prices for goods and services fairly steady. The situation in which the average of all prices of goods and services is rising is called <span data-type="term">inflation</span>. Inflation’s higher prices reduce <span data-type="term">purchasing power</span>, the value of what money can buy. Purchasing power is a function of two things: inflation and income. If incomes rise at the same rate as inflation, there is no change in purchasing power. If prices go up but income doesn’t rise or rises at a slower rate, a given amount of income buys less, and purchasing power falls. For example, if the price of a basket of groceries rises from $30 to $40 but your salary remains the same, you can buy only 75 percent as many groceries ($30 ÷ $40) for $30. Your purchasing power declines by 25 percent ($10 ÷ $40). If incomes rise at a rate faster than inflation, then purchasing power increases. So you can, in fact, have rising purchasing power even if inflation is increasing. Typically, however, inflation rises faster than incomes, leading to a decrease in purchasing power.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm369641088">Inflation affects both personal and business decisions. When prices are rising, people tend to spend more—before their purchasing power declines further. Businesses that expect inflation often increase their supplies, and people often speed up planned purchases of cars and major appliances.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm352845648">From the early 2000s to April 2017, inflation in the United States was very low, in the 0.1 to 3.8 percent range; for 2016 it was 1.3 percent. For comparison, in the 1980s, the United States had periods of inflation in the 12 to 13 percent range.<a href="#auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_rfin-ch01_22" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_rfin-ch01_22">“Historical Inflation Rates: 1914–2017,” http://www.usinflationcalculator.com, accessed May 19, 2017.</div></a> Some nations have had high double- and even triple-digit inflation in recent years.

<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm335987808">There are two types of inflation. <span data-type="term">Demand-pull inflation</span> occurs when the demand for goods and services is greater than the supply. Would-be buyers have more money to spend than the amount needed to buy available goods and services. Their demand, which exceeds the supply, tends to pull prices up. This situation is sometimes described as “too much money chasing too few goods.” The higher prices lead to greater supply, eventually creating a balance between demand and supply.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm369119008"><span data-type="term">Cost-push inflation</span> is triggered by increases in production costs, such as expenses for materials and wages. These increases push up the prices of final goods and services. Wage increases are a major cause of cost-push inflation, creating a “wage-price spiral.” For example, assume the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">United Auto Workers</span> union negotiates a three-year labor agreement that raises wages 3 percent per year and increases overtime pay. Carmakers will then raise car prices to cover their higher labor costs. Also, the higher wages will give autoworkers more money to buy goods and services, and this increased demand may pull up other prices. Workers in other industries will demand higher wages to keep up with the increased prices, and the cycle will push prices even higher.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_bsec-029"><h4 data-type="title">How Inflation Is Measured</h4>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm369555632">The rate of inflation is most commonly measured by looking at changes in the <span data-type="term">consumer price index (CPI)</span>, an index of the prices of a “market basket” of goods and services purchased by typical urban consumers. It is published monthly by the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Department of Labor</span>. Major components of the CPI, which are weighted by importance, are food and beverages, clothing, transportation, housing, medical care, recreation, and education. There are special indexes for food and energy. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Department of Labor</span> collects about 80,000 retail price quotes and 5,000 housing rent figures to calculate the CPI.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm355599216">The CPI sets prices in a base period at 100. The base period, which now is 1982–1984, is chosen for its price stability. Current prices are then expressed as a percentage of prices in the base period. A rise in the CPI means prices are increasing. For example, the CPI was 244.5 in April 2017, meaning that prices more than doubled since the 1982–1984 base period.</p>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm349389040">Changes in wholesale prices are another important indicator of inflation. The <span data-type="term">producer price index (PPI)</span> measures the prices paid by producers and wholesalers for various commodities, such as raw materials, partially finished goods, and finished products. The PPI, which uses 1982 as its base year, is actually a family of indexes for many different product categories, including crude goods (raw materials), intermediate goods (which become part of finished goods), and finished goods. For example, the PPI for finished goods was 197.7 in April 2017, a 3.9-point increase, and for chemicals was 106.5, up 3.8 points since April 2016. Examples of other PPI indexes include processed foods, lumber, containers, fuels and lubricants, metals, and construction. Because the PPI measures prices paid by producers for raw materials, energy, and other commodities, it may foreshadow subsequent price changes for businesses and consumers.</p>

<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm366802208">Inflation has several negative effects on people and businesses. For one thing, inflation penalizes people who live on fixed incomes. Let’s say that a couple receives $2,000 a month retirement income beginning in 2018. If inflation is 10 percent in 2019, then the couple can buy only about 91 percent (100 ÷ 110) of what they could purchase in 2018. Similarly, inflation hurts savers. As prices rise, the real value, or purchasing power, of a nest egg of savings deteriorates.</p>

<li>How do economic growth, full employment, price stability, and inflation indicate a nation’s economic health?</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_537264d9-0a84-47bd-823e-3093c1d2dcd1_fs-idm351607056">A nation’s economy is growing when the level of business activity, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) is rising. GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a year. The goal of full employment is to have a job for all who can and want to work. How well a nation is meeting its employment goals is measured by the unemployment rate. There are four types of unemployment: frictional, structural, cyclical, and seasonal. With price stability, the overall prices of goods and services are not moving very much either up or down. Inflation is the general upward movement of prices. When prices rise, purchasing power falls. The rate of inflation is measured by changes in the consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI). There are two main causes of inflation. If the demand for goods and services exceeds the supply, prices will rise. This is called demand-pull inflation. With cost-push inflation, higher production costs, such as expenses for materials and wages, increase the final prices of goods and services.</p>

<li>How does the government use monetary policy and fiscal policy to achieve its macroeconomic goals?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_fs-idm349534336">To reach macroeconomic goals, countries must often choose among conflicting alternatives. Sometimes political needs override economic needs. For example, bringing inflation under control may call for a politically difficult period of high unemployment and low growth. Or, in an election year, politicians may resist raising taxes to curb inflation. Still, the government must try to guide the economy to a sound balance of growth, employment, and price stability. The two main tools it uses are monetary policy and fiscal policy.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_bsec-033"><h3 data-type="title">Monetary Policy</h3><p id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_fs-idm359910416"><span data-type="term">Monetary policy</span> refers to a government’s programs for controlling the amount of money circulating in the economy and interest rates. Changes in the money supply affect both the level of economic activity and the rate of inflation. The <span data-type="term">Federal Reserve System (the Fed)</span>, the central banking system of the United States, prints money and controls how much of it will be in circulation. The money supply is also controlled by the Fed’s regulation of certain bank activities.</p>
<p id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_fs-idm351959024">When the Fed increases or decreases the amount of money in circulation, it affects interest rates (the cost of borrowing money and the reward for lending it). The Fed can change the interest rate on money it lends to banks to signal the banking system and financial markets that it has changed its monetary policy. These changes have a ripple effect. Banks, in turn, may pass along this change to consumers and businesses that receive loans from the banks. If the cost of borrowing increases, the economy slows because interest rates affect consumer and business decisions to spend or invest. The housing industry, business, and investments react most to changes in interest rates.</p>
<p id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_fs-idm357055520">As a result of the 2007–2009 recession and the global financial crisis that ensued, the Fed dropped the federal funds rate—the interest rate charged on overnight loans between banks—to 0 percent in December 2008 and kept the rate at zero until December 2015, when it raised the rate to 0.25 percent. This decision marked the first increase in the federal-funds rate since June 2006, when the federal funds rate was 5.25 percent. As the U.S. economy continues to show a slow but steady expansion, the Fed subsequently increased the federal funds rate to a range of 0.75 to 1 percent in March 2017. As expected, this change has a ripple effect: the regional Federal Reserve Banks increase the discount rate they charge commercial banks for short-term loans, many commercial banks raise the interest rates they charge their customers, and credit card companies increase the annual percentage rate (APR) they charge consumers on their credit card balances.<a href="#auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_rfin-ch01_24" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_rfin-ch01_24">Binyamin Appelbaum, “Fed Raises Interest Rates for Third Time Since Financial Crisis,” <em data-effect="italics">The New York Times,</em> http://www.nytimes.com, March 15, 2017; Lauren Lyons Cole, “How the Fed’s Interest-Rate Hike Affects Consumers,” <em data-effect="italics">Consumer Reports,</em> http://www.consumerreports.org, March 15, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_fs-idm334803424">As you can see, the Fed can use monetary policy to contract or expand the economy. With <span data-type="term">contractionary policy</span>, the Fed restricts, or tightens, the money supply by selling government securities or raising interest rates. The result is slower economic growth and higher unemployment. Thus, contractionary policy reduces spending and, ultimately, lowers inflation. With <span data-type="term">expansionary policy</span>, the Fed increases, or loosens, growth in the money supply. An expansionary policy stimulates the economy. Interest rates decline, so business and consumer spending go up. Unemployment rates drop as businesses expand. But increasing the money supply also has a negative side: more spending pushes prices up, increasing the inflation rate.</p>

By cutting taxes or by increasing spending, the government can stimulate the economy. Look again at <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_0cafad1a-91cd-4524-b36d-12c1c880e4a4_bfig-005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong>. The more government buys from businesses, the greater the business revenues and output. Likewise, if consumers or businesses have to pay less in taxes, they will have more income to spend for goods and services. Tax policies in the United States therefore affect business decisions. High corporate taxes can make it harder for U.S. firms to compete with companies in countries with lower taxes. As a result, companies may choose to locate facilities overseas to reduce their tax burden.</p><p id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_fs-idm349097664">Nobody likes to pay taxes, although we grudgingly accept that we have to. Although most U.S. citizens complain that they are overtaxed, we pay lower taxes per capita (per person) than citizens in many countries similar to ours. In addition, our taxes represent a lower percentage of gross income and GDP compared to most countries.</p>
<p id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_fs-idm361481216">Taxes are, of course, the major source of revenue for our government. Every year, the president prepares a budget for the coming year based upon estimated revenues and expenditures. Congress receives the president’s report and recommendations and then, typically, debates and analyzes the proposed budget for several months. The president’s original proposal is always modified in numerous ways. <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_bfig-008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong> shows the sources of revenue and expenses for the U.S. budget.</p>

When government takes more money from business and consumers (the private sector), a phenomenon known as <span data-type="term">crowding out</span> occurs. Here are three examples of crowding out:</p>
<ol id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_bl-018">
<li>The government spends more on public libraries, and individuals buy fewer books at bookstores.</li>
<li>The government spends more on public education, and individuals spend less on private education.</li>
<li>The government spends more on public transportation, and individuals spend less on private transportation.</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_fs-idm365376752">In other words, government spending is crowding out private spending.</p>
<p id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_fs-idm368606528">If the government spends more for programs (social services, education, defense) than it collects in taxes, the result is a <span data-type="term">federal budget deficit</span>. To balance the budget, the government can cut its spending, increase taxes, or do some combination of the two. When it cannot balance the budget, the government must make up any shortfalls by borrowing (just like any business or household).</p>
<p id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_fs-idm367262368">In 1998, for the first time in a generation, there was a federal budget surplus (revenue exceeding spending) of about $71 billion. That budget surplus was short lived, however. By 2005, the deficit was more than $318 billion. In the fiscal year of 2009, the federal deficit was at an all-time high of more than $1.413 trillion. Six years later, at the end of the 2015 fiscal year, the deficit decreased to $438 billion.<a href="#auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_rfin-ch01_25" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_rfin-ch01_25">Mike Patton, “U.S. Government Deficit Is Rising Again,” <em data-effect="italics">Forbes,</em> http://www.forbes.com, April 28, 2016.</div></a> The U.S. government has run budget deficits for many years. The accumulated total of these past deficits is the <span data-type="term">national debt</span>, which now amounts to about $19.8 trillion, or about $61,072 for every man, woman, and child in the United States. Total interest on the debt is more than $2.5 trillion a year.<a href="#auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_rfin-ch01_26" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_rfin-ch01_26">“Quantifying the National Debt,” http://www.justfacts.com, accessed May 23, 2017; “U.S. National Debt Clock: U.S. Total Interest Paid,” http://usdebtclock.org, accessed May 23, 2017.</div></a> To cover the deficit, the U.S. government borrows money from people and businesses in the form of Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds. These are federal IOUs that pay interest to their owners.</p>
<p id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_fs-idm353590048">The national debt is an emotional issue debated not only in the halls of Congress, but by the public as well. Some believe that deficits contribute to economic growth, high employment, and price stability. Others have the following reservations about such a high national debt:</p>
<ul id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_bl-019">
<li><em data-effect="italics">Not Everyone Holds the Debt:</em> The government is very conscious of who actually bears the burden of the national debt and keeps track of who holds what bonds. If only the rich were bondholders, then they alone would receive the interest payments and could end up receiving more in interest than they paid in taxes. In the meantime, poorer people, who held no bonds, would end up paying taxes that would be transferred to the rich as interest, making the debt an unfair burden to them. At times, therefore, the government has instructed commercial banks to reduce their total debt by divesting some of their bond holdings. That’s also why the Treasury created <span data-type="term">savings bonds</span>. Because these bonds are issued in relatively small denominations, they allow more people to buy and hold government debt.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">It Crowds Out Private Investment:</em> The national debt also affects private investment. If the government raises the interest rate on bonds to be able to sell them, it forces private businesses, whose corporate bonds (long-term debt obligations issued by a company) compete with government bonds for investor dollars, to raise rates on their bonds to stay competitive. In other words, selling government debt to finance government spending makes it more costly for private industry to finance its own investment. As a result, government debt may end up crowding out private investment and slowing economic growth in the private sector.</li>

<li>How does the government use monetary policy and fiscal policy to achieve its macroeconomic goals?</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_55347de3-ecd4-4584-b478-43eeccb2603e_fs-idm367905232">Monetary policy refers to actions by the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) to control the money supply. When the Fed restricts the money supply, interest rates rise, the inflation rate drops, and economic growth slows. By expanding the money supply, the Fed stimulates economic growth. The government also uses fiscal policy— changes in levels of taxation and spending—to control the economy. Reducing taxes or increasing spending stimulates the economy; raising taxes or decreasing spending does the opposite. When the government spends more than it receives in tax revenues, it must borrow to finance the deficit. Some economists favor deficit spending as a way to stimulate the economy; others worry about our high level of national debt.</p>

<li>What are the basic microeconomic concepts of demand and supply, and how do they establish prices?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm351443344">Now let’s shift our focus from the whole economy to <em data-effect="italics">microeconomics,</em> the study of households, businesses, and industries. This field of economics is concerned with how prices and quantities of goods and services behave in a free market. It stands to reason that people, firms, and governments try to get the most from their limited resources. Consumers want to buy the best quality at the lowest price. Businesses want to keep costs down and revenues high to earn larger profits. Governments also want to use their revenues to provide the most effective public goods and services possible. These groups choose among alternatives by focusing on the prices of goods and services.</p>

<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm341057488">As consumers in a free market, we influence what is produced. If Mexican food is popular, the high demand attracts entrepreneurs who open more Mexican restaurants. They want to compete for our dollars by supplying Mexican food at a lower price, of better quality, or with different features, such as Santa Fe Mexican food rather than Tex-Mex. This section explains how business and consumer choices influence the price and availability of goods and services.</p>

The higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded, and vice versa. A graph of this relationship is called a <span data-type="term">demand curve</span>.</p>
<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm351560176">Let’s assume you own a store that sells jackets for snowboarders. From past experience, you know how many jackets you can sell at different prices. The demand curve in <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_bfig-010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong> depicts this information. The <em data-effect="italics">x</em>-axis (horizontal axis) shows the quantity of jackets, and the <em data-effect="italics">y</em>-axis (vertical axis) shows the related price of those jackets. For example, at a price of $100, customers will buy (demand) 600 snowboard jackets.</p>
<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm349775024">In the graph, the demand curve slopes downward and to the right because as the price falls, people will want to buy more jackets. Some people who were not going to buy a jacket will purchase one at the lower price. Also, some snowboarders who already have a jacket will buy a second one. The graph also shows that if you put a large number of jackets on the market, you will have to reduce the price to sell all of them.</p>
<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm365360176">Understanding demand is critical to businesses. Demand tells you <em data-effect="italics">how much you can sell</em> and <em data-effect="italics">at what price</em>—in other words, how much money the firm will take in that can be used to cover costs and hopefully earn a profit. Gauging demand is difficult even for the very largest corporations, but particularly for small firms.</p>

Note that the supply curve slopes upward and to the right, the opposite of the demand curve. If snowboarders are willing to pay higher prices, suppliers of jackets will buy more inputs (for example, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Gore-Tex</span>® fabric, dye, machinery, labor) and produce more jackets. The quantity supplied will be higher at higher prices, because manufacturers can earn higher profits.</p>

<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm365709056">In a stable economy, the number of jackets that snowboarders demand depends on the jackets’ price. Likewise, the number of jackets that suppliers provide depends on price. But at what price will consumer demand for jackets match the quantity suppliers will produce?</p>
<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm353041152">To answer this question, we need to look at what happens when demand and supply interact. By plotting both the demand curve and the supply curve on the same graph in <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_bfig-012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong>, we see that they cross at a certain quantity and price. At that point, labeled E, the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. This is the point of <span data-type="term">equilibrium</span>. The equilibrium price is $80; the equilibrium quantity is 700 jackets. At that point, there is a balance between the quantity consumers will buy and the quantity suppliers will make available.</p>
<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm348597552">Market equilibrium is achieved through a series of quantity and price adjustments that occur automatically. If the price increases to $160, suppliers produce more jackets than consumers are willing to buy, and a surplus results. To sell more jackets, prices will have to fall. Thus, a surplus pushes prices downward until equilibrium is reached. When the price falls to $60, the quantity of jackets demanded rises above the available supply. The resulting shortage forces prices upward until equilibrium is reached at $80.</p>

If demand increases, more jackets will be purchased at every price, and the demand curve shifts to the right (as illustrated by line D<sub>2</sub> in <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_bfig-013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong>). If demand decreases, less will be bought at every price, and the demand curve shifts to the left (D<sub>1</sub>). When demand decreased, snowboarders bought 500 jackets at $80 instead of 700 jackets. When demand increased, they purchased 800.</p>

<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm365292432">A number of things can increase or decrease demand. For example, if snowboarders’ incomes go up, they may decide to buy a second jacket. If incomes fall, a snowboarder who was planning to purchase a jacket may wear an old one instead. Changes in fashion or tastes can also influence demand. If snowboarding were suddenly to go out of fashion, demand for jackets would decrease quickly. A change in the price of related products can also influence demand. For example, if the average price of a snowboard rises to $1,000, people will quit snowboarding, and jacket demand will fall.</p>
<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm363424576">Another factor that can shift demand is expectations about future prices. If you expect jacket prices to increase significantly in the future, you may decide to go ahead and get one today. If you think prices will fall, you will postpone your purchase. Finally, changes in the number of buyers will affect demand. Snowboarding is a young person’s sport, and the number of teenagers will increase in the next few years. Therefore, the demand for snowboard jackets should increase.</p>

New technology typically lowers the cost of production. For example, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">North Face</span>, a supplier of ski and snowboard jackets, purchased laser-guided pattern-cutting equipment and computer-aided pattern-making equipment. Each jacket was cheaper to produce, resulting in a higher profit per jacket. This provided an incentive to supply more jackets at every price. If the price of resources such as labor or fabric goes up, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">North Face</span> will earn a smaller profit on each jacket, and the amount supplied will decrease at every price. The reverse is also true. Changes in the prices of other goods can also affect supply.</p>
<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm336009568">Let’s say that snow skiing becomes a really hot sport again. The number of skiers jumps dramatically, and the price of ski jackets soars. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">North Face</span> can use its machines and fabrics to produce either ski or snowboard jackets. If the company can make more profit from ski jackets, it will produce fewer snowboard jackets at every price. Also, a change in the number of producers will shift the supply curve. If the number of jacket suppliers increases, they will place more jackets on the market at every price. If any suppliers stop making jackets available, the supply will naturally decrease. Taxes can also affect supply. If the government decides, for some reason, to tax the supplier for every snowboard jacket produced, then profits will fall, and fewer jackets will be offered at every price. <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_btab-002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong> summarizes the factors that can shift demand and supply curves.</p>
<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm352194976">To better understand the relationship between supply and demand across the economy, consider the impact of 2005’s <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hurricane Katrina</span> on U.S. energy prices. Oil and gas prices were already at high levels before Hurricane Katrina disrupted production in the Gulf Coast. Most U.S. offshore drilling sites are located in the Gulf of Mexico, and almost 30 percent of U.S. refining capacity is in Gulf States that were hit hard by the storm. Prices rose almost immediately as supplies fell while demand remained at the same levels.</p>
<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm353452128">The storm drove home the vulnerability of the U.S. energy supply to not only natural disasters, but also terrorist attacks and price increases from foreign oil producers. Many energy policy experts questioned the wisdom of having such a high concentration of oil facilities—about 25 percent of the oil and natural gas infrastructure—in hurricane-prone states. Refiners were already almost at capacity before Katrina’s devastation.<a href="#auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_rfin-ch01_27" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_rfin-ch01_27">Kimberly Amadeo, “Hurricane Katrina Facts: Damage and Costs,” <em data-effect="italics">The Balance,</em> http://www.thebalance.com, February 9, 2017.</div></a></p>

With oil at the time costing $50 to $60 a barrel—more than double the 2003 price—both businesses and consumers across the United States felt the pinch in their wallets. Midwestern agricultural businesses export about 70 percent of their grain production through Gulf of Mexico port facilities. With fewer usable docking spaces, barges couldn’t unload and return for more crops. The supply of both transportation services and grain products was inadequate to meet demand, pushing up transportation and grain costs. Higher gas prices also contributed to rising prices, as 80 percent of shipping costs are related to fuel.</p>
<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm363307424">More than a decade after Katrina, U.S. gas prices have fluctuated dramatically, with the cost of a gallon of regular gas peaking in 2014 at $3.71, dropping as low as $1.69 in early 2015, and moderating to $2.36 in mid-2017. Recent research by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">JP Morgan Chase</span> revealed that consumers spend roughly 80 percent of their savings from lower gas prices, which helps the overall economy.<a href="#auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_rfin-ch01_28" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_rfin-ch01_28">“18-Month Average Retail Price Chart (2015–2017),” http://www.gasbuddy.com, accessed May 23, 2017; JPMorgan Chase Institute, “How Falling Gas Prices Fuel the Consumer,” https://www.jpmorganchase, accessed May 23, 2017.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_78ea8e25-72af-4843-9e65-57fe13f990b6_fs-idm363356000">Demand is the quantity of a good or service that people will buy at a given price. Supply is the quantity of a good or service that firms will make available at a given price. When the price increases, the quantity demanded falls, but the quantity supplied rises. A price decrease leads to increased demand but a lower supply. At the point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, demand and supply are in balance. This equilibrium point is achieved by market adjustments of quantity and price.</p>

<li>What are the four types of market structure?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm243385760">One of the characteristics of a free-market system is that suppliers have the right to compete with one another. The number of suppliers in a market defines the <span data-type="term">market structure</span>. Economists identify four types of market structures: (1) perfect competition, (2) pure monopoly, (3) monopolistic competition, and (4) oligopoly. <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_btab-003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong> summarizes the characteristics of each of these market structures.</p>

<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm237046832">Characteristics of <span data-type="term">perfect (pure) competition</span> include:</p>
<ul id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_bl-026">
<li>A large number of small firms are in the market.</li>
<li>The firms sell similar products; that is, each firm’s product is very much like the products sold by other firms in the market.</li>
<li>Buyers and sellers in the market have good information about prices, sources of supply, and so on.</li>
<li>It is easy to open a new business or close an existing one.</li>

<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm245569392">In a perfectly competitive market, firms sell their products at prices determined solely by forces beyond their control. Because the products are very similar and each firm contributes only a small amount to the total quantity supplied by the industry, price is determined by supply and demand. A firm that raised its price even a little above the going rate would lose customers. In the wheat market, for example, the product is essentially the same from one wheat producer to the next. Thus, none of the producers has control over the price of wheat.</p>
<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm234984800">Perfect competition is an ideal. No industry shows all its characteristics, but the stock market and some agricultural markets, such as those for wheat and corn, come closest. Farmers, for example, can sell all of their crops through national commodity exchanges at the current market price.</p>

<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm253489696">At the other end of the spectrum is <span data-type="term">pure monopoly</span>, the market structure in which a single firm accounts for all industry sales of a particular good or service. The firm <em data-effect="italics">is</em> the industry. This market structure is characterized by <span data-type="term">barriers to entry</span>—factors that prevent new firms from competing equally with the existing firm. Often the barriers are technological or legal conditions. Polaroid, for example, held major patents on instant photography for years. When <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Kodak</span> tried to market its own instant camera, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Polaroid</span> sued, claiming patent violations. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Polaroid</span> collected millions of dollars from <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Kodak</span>. Another barrier may be one firm’s control of a natural resource. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd.</span>, for example, controls most of the world’s supply of uncut diamonds.</p>
<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm247728864">Public utilities, such as gas and water companies, are pure monopolies. Some monopolies are created by a government order that outlaws competition. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">U.S. Postal Service</span> is currently one such monopoly.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_bsec-046"><h3 data-type="title">Monopolistic Competition</h3>
<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm235273120">Three characteristics define the market structure known as <span data-type="term">monopolistic competition</span>:</p>
<ul id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_bl-027">
<li>Many firms are in the market.</li>
<li>The firms offer products that are close substitutes but still differ from one another.</li>
<li>It is relatively easy to enter the market.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm239650576">Under monopolistic competition, firms take advantage of product differentiation. Industries where monopolistic competition occurs include clothing, food, and similar consumer products. Firms under monopolistic competition have more control over pricing than do firms under perfect competition because consumers do not view the products as perfect substitutes. Nevertheless, firms must demonstrate product differences to justify their prices to customers. Consequently, companies use advertising to distinguish their products from others. Such distinctions may be significant or superficial. For example, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nike</span> says “Just Do It,” and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Tylenol</span> is advertised as being easier on the stomach than aspirin.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_bsec-047"><h3 data-type="title">Oligopoly</h3>
<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm253262368">An <span data-type="term">oligopoly</span> has two characteristics:</p>
<ul id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_bl-028">
<li>A few firms produce most or all of the output.</li>
<li>Large capital requirements or other factors limit the number of firms.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm244162832"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Boeing</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Airbus Industries</span> (aircraft manufacturers) and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Apple</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Google</span> (operating systems for smartphones) are major players in different oligopolistic industries.</p>
<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm236783568">With so few firms in an oligopoly, what one firm does has an impact on the other firms. Thus, the firms in an oligopoly watch one another closely for new technologies, product changes and innovations, promotional campaigns, pricing, production, and other developments. Sometimes they go so far as to coordinate their pricing and output decisions, which is illegal. Many antitrust cases—legal challenges arising out of laws designed to control anticompetitive behavior—occur in oligopolies.</p>
<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm236318272">The market structure of an industry can change over time. Take, for example, telecommunications. At one time, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">AT&amp;T</span> had a monopoly on long-distance telephone service nationwide. Then the U.S. government divided the company into seven regional phone companies in 1984, opening the door to greater competition. Other companies such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">MCI</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Sprint</span> entered the fray and built state-of-the-art fiber-optic networks to win customers from the traditional providers of phone service. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">1996 Telecommunications Act</span> changed the competitive environment yet again by allowing local phone companies to offer long-distance service in exchange for letting competition into their local markets. Today, the broadcasting, computer, telephone, and video industries are converging as companies consolidate through merger and acquisition.</p>

</ol>
<p id="auto_b079347a-3546-4bc7-aa1a-1c8074bc4ef1_fs-idm248635696">Market structure is the number of suppliers in a market. Perfect competition is characterized by a large number of buyers and sellers, very similar products, good market information for both buyers and sellers, and ease of entry into and exit from the market. In a pure monopoly, there is a single seller in a market. In monopolistic competition, many firms sell close substitutes in a market that is fairly easy to enter. In an oligopoly, a few firms produce most or all of the industry’s output. An oligopoly is also difficult to enter, and what one firm does will influence others.</p>

<li>Which trends are reshaping the business, microeconomic, and macroeconomic environments and competitive arena?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm356303824">Trends in the business and economic environment occur in many areas. As noted earlier, today’s workforce is more diverse than ever, with increasing numbers of minorities and older workers. Competition has intensified. Technology has accelerated the pace of work and the ease with which we communicate. Let’s look at how companies are meeting the challenges of a changing workforce, the growing demand for energy, and how companies are meeting competitive challenges.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_bsec-050"><h3 data-type="title">Changing Workforce Demographics</h3>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm353189680">As the baby boomer generation ages, so does the U.S. workforce. In 2010, more than 25 percent of all employees were retirement age. Fast forward to the U.S. labor force in 2017, however, and millennials have taken over the top spot in the labor market, with more than 40 percent of the total workforce. Although older workers are now retiring closer to the traditional retirement age of 65, many plan to keep working beyond 65, often into their 70s. No longer is retirement an all-or-nothing proposition, and older workers in the baby boomer generation are taking a more positive attitude toward their later years. A surprising number of Americans expect to work full- or part-time after “retirement,” and most would probably work longer if phased retirement programs were available at their companies. Financial reasons motivate most of these older workers, who worry that their longer life expectancies will mean outliving the money they saved for retirement, especially after retirement savings took a hit during the global recession of 2007–2009. For others, however, the satisfaction of working and feeling productive is more important than money alone.<a href="#auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_29" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_29">“The Retirement Problem: What Will You Do with All That Time?” <em data-effect="italics">Knowledge@Wharton,</em> http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu, January 14, 2016.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm352169536">These converging dynamics continue to create several major challenges for companies today. And by 2020, additional generational shifts are projected to occur in the U.S. labor force, which will have an even bigger effect on how companies do business and retain their employees. Today’s workforce spans five generations: recent college graduates (Generation Z); people in their 30s and 40s (millennials and Generation X); baby boomers; and traditionalists (people in their 70s). It is not unusual to find a worker who is 50, 60, or even 70 working for a manager who is not yet 30. People in their 50s and 60s offer their vast experience of “what’s worked in the past,” whereas those in their 20s and 30s tend to be experimental, open to options, and unafraid to take risks. The most effective managers will be the ones who recognize generational differences and use them to the company’s advantage.<a href="#auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_30" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_30">Michael Zimmerman, “Millennials in the Workforce: What They Want, and How to Manage Them,” http://www.smartceo.com, January 11, 2017; Kathy Gurchiek, “What Motivates Your Workers? It Depends on Their Generation,” <em data-effect="italics">Society for Human Resource Management,</em> http://www.shrm.org, May 9, 2016.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm352169760">Many companies have developed programs such as flexible hours and telecommuting to retain older workers and benefit from their practical knowledge and problem-solving skills. In addition, companies should continually track where employees are in their career life cycles, know when they are approaching retirement age or thinking about retirement, and determine how to replace them and their knowledge and job experiences.<a href="#auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_31" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_31">Tom Anderson, “Employers Offer Older Workers Flexible Retirement,” <em data-effect="italics">CNBC,</em> http://www.cnbc.com, August 21, 2016.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm356349568">Another factor in the changing workforce is the importance of recognizing diversity among workers of all ages and fostering an inclusive organizational culture. According to a recent report by the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">U.S. Census Bureau</span>, millennials are the largest generation in U.S. history, and more than 44 percent classify themselves as something other than “White.” In addition, women continue to make progress on being promoted to management, although their path to CEO seems to be filled with obstacles. Recent statistics suggest that fewer than 5 percent of Fortune 500 companies have female CEOs. The most successful organizations will be the ones that recognize the importance of diversity and inclusion as part of their ongoing corporate strategies.<a href="#auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_32" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_32">Blaze Stutes, “The State of US Workforce Diversity in 14 Statistics,” http://archpointgroup.com, December 1, 2016; Vivian Hunt, Dennis Layton, and Sara Prince, “Why Diversity Matters,” <em data-effect="italics">McKinsey &amp; Company,</em> http://www.mckinsey.com, January 2015.</div></a></p>

This is particularly critical as multicultural millennials become the dominant group in the U.S. workforce. One leader in embracing diversity as an important part of corporate life is <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">EY</span> (formerly Ernst &amp; Young), a global leader in assurance, tax, and advisory services.</p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm365267088"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">EY</span> believes its core values and business strategies are firmly based on diversity and inclusiveness, as evidenced by the company landing in the top spot of DiversityInc’s 2017 list of the top companies for diversity. This recognition for <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">EY</span> is no accident; the company has made diversity and inclusion key goals for its more than 214,000 employees around the world. With a diverse workforce becoming the norm, it is no longer acceptable for companies to simply hold a random seminar or two for their managers and employees to discuss diversity and inclusion in the workplace.</p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm363368896">Karyn Twaronite, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">EY</span>’s global diversity and inclusion officer, believes that a simple, ongoing approach is the most effective way to address diversity and inclusion in the workplace. The company uses a decision-making strategy called PTR, or preference, tradition, and requirement, to help managers think about diversity and inclusion. The strategy challenges managers to examine preferences toward job candidates who are similar to themselves, asks them whether their decision about hiring a specific candidate is influenced by traditional characteristics of a certain role, and urges them to make their selection based on the requirements of the job rather than on their personal preferences. In other words, the decision-making tool gives people a way to question the status quo without accusing colleagues of being biased.</p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm355719616">Another way <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">EY</span> fosters inclusiveness is sponsoring professional network groups within the organization. These groups provide members with opportunities to network across various <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">EY</span> divisions, create informal mentoring relationships, and strengthen leadership skills. Some of the established networks within <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">EY</span> include groups for LGBTQ employees; Black, Latino, and pan-Asian people; women; veterans; and employees with disabilities.</p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm369228016">As a global company that works with clients in many countries, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">EY</span> knows the importance of acknowledging different perspectives and cultures as part of its daily business. The company is committed to making sure employees as well as clients respect different viewpoints and individual differences, including background, education, gender, ethnicity, religious background, sexual orientation, ability, and technical skills. According to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">EY</span>’s diversity web page, research shows that a company’s diverse teams are more likely to improve market share and have success in new markets and that they demonstrate stronger collaboration and better retention.</p>

<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm352578528">As standards of living improve worldwide, the demand for energy continues to rise. Emerging economies such as China and India need energy to grow. Their demands are placing pressure on the world’s supplies and affecting prices, as the laws of supply and demand would predict. For example, in recent years, China and India were responsible for more than half of the growth in oil products consumption worldwide. State-supported energy companies in China, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other countries will place additional competitive pressure on privately owned oil companies such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">BP</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Chevron</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">ExxonMobil</span>, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Shell</span>.<a href="#auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_33" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_33">Global Energy Statistical Yearbook 2016, “Oil Products Domestic Consumption,” https://yearbook.enerdata.net, accessed May 23, 2017; Joe Carroll, “Big Oil Heads for Back-to-Back Profit Triumphs as Fortunes Turn,” <em data-effect="italics">Bloomberg Markets,</em> http://www.bloomberg.com, April 28, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm356019616">Countries worldwide worry about relying too heavily on one source of supply for energy.

For example, continuing tensions between Russia and Ukraine in November 2015 caused Russia to stop sending natural gas to Ukraine, which also causes gas disruptions in Europe because Russia uses Ukraine’s pipelines to transport some of its gas deliveries to European countries. In 2017, Russia announced plans to build its own pipeline alongside Ukraine’s gas line in the Baltic Sea, which would allow Russia to bypass Ukraine’s pipelines altogether and deliver gas directly to European countries.<a href="#auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_35" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_35">Kenneth Rapoza, “Russia’s Gazprom Doubling Down on ‘Anti-Ukraine’ Baltic Pipeline,” <em data-effect="italics">Forbes,</em> http://www.forbes.com, March 14, 2017; Nataliya Vasilyeva, “Ukraine Stops Buying Russian Gas, Closes Airspace,” <em data-effect="italics">USA Today,</em> http://www.usatoday.com, November 25, 2015.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm367301776">Countries and companies worldwide are seeking additional sources of supply to prevent being held captive to one supplier. For example, the relatively new technology of extracting oil from shale rock formations in the United States (known as fracking) has help create an important resource for the country’s oil industry. This innovative approach to finding new sources of energy now accounts for more than half of the country’s oil output, which can help reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and create new jobs.<a href="#auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_36" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_rfin-ch01_36">“U.S. Shale Is Turning Up the Heat on OPEC,” http://oilprice.com, May 20, 2017; Matt Egan, “Oil Milestone: Fracking Fuels Half of U.S. Output,” <em data-effect="italics">CNN Money,</em> http://money.cnn.com, March 24, 2016; Ed Crooks, “The US Shale Revolution,” <em data-effect="italics">Financial Times,</em> http://www.ft.com, April 24, 2015.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm351597824">Companies are turning to many different strategies to remain competitive in the global marketplace. One of the most important is <span data-type="term">relationship management</span>, which involves building, maintaining, and enhancing interactions with customers and other parties to develop long-term satisfaction through mutually beneficial partnerships. Relationship management includes both <em data-effect="italics">supply chain management</em>, which builds strong bonds with suppliers, and <em data-effect="italics">relationship marketing</em>, which focuses on customers. In general, the longer a customer stays with a company, the more that customer is worth. Long-term customers buy more, take less of a company’s time, are less sensitive to price, and bring in new customers. Best of all, they require no acquisition or start-up costs. Good long-standing customers are worth so much that in some industries, reducing customer defections by as little as five points—from, say, 15 percent to 10 percent per year—can double profits.</p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm366525184">Another important way companies stay competitive is through <span data-type="term">strategic alliances</span> (also called <em data-effect="italics">strategic partnerships</em>). The trend toward forming these cooperative agreements between business firms is accelerating rapidly, particularly among high-tech firms. These companies have realized that strategic partnerships are more than just important—they are critical. Strategic alliances can take many forms. Some companies enter into strategic alliances with their suppliers, who take over much of their actual production and manufacturing. For example, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nike</span>, the largest producer of athletic footwear in the world, does not manufacture a single shoe.</p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm367309536">Other companies with complementary strengths team up. For example, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Harry’s Shave Club</span>, an online men’s grooming subscription service, recently teamed up with retail giant <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Target</span> to improve sales and boost its brand presence among <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Target</span> shoppers. Harry’s products are now available in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Target</span>’s brick-and-mortar stores and on <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Target</span>’s website as part of an exclusive deal that makes <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Target</span> the only mass retailer to carry Harry’s grooming products.

</ol>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm366784000">To remain competitive, businesses must identify and respond to trends in the various sectors of the business environment. As the population ages, large numbers of baby boomers are approaching retirement age. Companies must plan for this exodus of employees and find ways to retain the vast amounts of knowledge they represent. Many older workers are choosing to continue working after traditional retirement age, creating a five-generation workforce. Worldwide demand for energy, especially from China and India, is challenging oil companies to increase supplies or to find alternative technologies to produce more oil, such as fracking. U.S. vulnerability to disruptions in energy supply became painfully apparent when Hurricane Katrina put Gulf Coast refineries and offshore drilling rigs out of commission. Companies are using relationship management and strategic alliances to compete effectively in the global economy.</p>

<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm327415088">Historically, diesel cars have not been big sellers in the U.S. auto market, mainly because their engines couldn’t pass the strict emissions standards set up by the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board. But that all changed in 2005, when German automaker Volkswagen made a decided push to develop “clean diesel” engines, specifically manufactured to meet strict U.S. emissions standards.</p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm351991504">By 2010, VW had introduced several models of diesel cars in the United States, and their sales helped propel Volkswagen to the number-two slot in global auto sales, after Toyota and ahead of GM. While VW was receiving major media attention for its clean diesel models, researchers from West Virginia University discovered that these so-called clean engines had been constructed with a “defeat device”—software that could actually tell when the car was being tested off road for emissions and lower the level of emissions that harm the environment.</p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm369046368">By December 2014, Volkswagen agreed to voluntarily recall more than a half-million clean diesel cars in the United States to address the emissions issues. But the scandal continued to escalate, with accusations that senior management knew about the rigged engines, and VW’s CEO resigned and several other executives were fired.</p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm357817008">Class-action lawsuits and other litigation followed, and in April 2017, VW agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement, which included a criminal fine of $2.8 billion, as well as various buyback plans for the affected diesel cars. In addition, over the last several years, VW has experienced a significant decline in U.S. sales and is now trying to win back customers.</p>

<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm356383216">As the world’s largest retailer, Walmart has built thousands of brick-and-mortar stores in the United States, Mexico, and elsewhere. Although a success story when it comes to traditional retail locations, Walmart has struggled with its e-commerce efforts, with recent online sales accounting for about 3 percent of the company’s $300 billion in annual sales. The company has tried several different e-commerce strategies in the past, but none of them was an overwhelming success. Some company insiders objected to the pricing strategy used for online purchases; they were fearful that Walmart’s lower prices online would take customers (and sales) away from the retail locations.</p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm365256560">Doug McMillon, Walmart’s CEO since 2014, believed a significant change was needed in the company’s e-commerce business, and he recently made changes in a big way. Over the past two years, Walmart spent billions to acquire several online companies to expand its e-commerce business in an effort to take a small bite out of retail giant Amazon’s success. In 2016, Walmart purchased Jet.com, an e-commerce site that sells a little bit of everything (books, clothing, electronics, etc.) at discount prices. Once the $3 billion acquisition was completed, Jet’s cofounder and CEO, Marc Lore, who now runs Walmart’s e-commerce platform, worked with McMillon to identify other established online companies to add to their e-commerce portfolio, and add they did.</p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm353648928">First Walmart purchased footwear e-tailer ShoeBuy for $70 million in January 2017. The following month, Walmart bought outdoor specialty retailer Moosejaw for $51 million. Then in March, Walmart paid $75 million for ModCloth, an eclectic shopping site for women’s fashions. Walmart is also said to be in negotiations to buy Bonobos, a hip fashion retailer geared to millennial males.</p>
<p id="auto_7b713776-b99c-4431-975f-5d4f7a0dae7c_fs-idm358227984">Reaction to the acquisitions has been mixed, depending on whom you ask. Retail analysts applaud the company’s radical move, pointing out that several well-known traditional retailers have closed their doors or filed bankruptcy because they failed to take part in the e-commerce revolution. Fashionistas, on the other hand, are lukewarm about the move. However, McMillon’s decision to allow the online retailers to operate independently may help retain loyal customers. The new e-commerce strategy may also lure typical in-store shoppers to take advantage of the expanded offerings available through both Walmart.com and Jet.com.</p>

Founded nearly a century ago in Rhode Island, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hasbro</span> integrates its CSR efforts throughout the organization with the goal of helping to make the world a better place for children of all ages.</p>
<p id="auto_288104a9-b9b5-45f7-85e6-5cf074dc65b9_fs-idm222934320">In 2017, the company achieved the number one spot in the “100 Best Corporate Citizens” rankings, published annually by <em data-effect="italics">Corporate Responsibility</em> magazine.

</figure><p id="auto_288104a9-b9b5-45f7-85e6-5cf074dc65b9_fs-idm231885120">With more than 5,000 employees, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hasbro</span> relies heavily on its strategic brand blueprint to guide its efforts in CSR, innovation, philanthropy, and product development. With a business portfolio that includes such well-known brands as Nerf, Play-Doh, Transformers, Monopoly, and The Game of Life, the company focuses its CSR efforts on four key areas: product safety, environmental sustainability, human rights and ethical sourcing, and community.</p>
<p id="auto_288104a9-b9b5-45f7-85e6-5cf074dc65b9_fs-idm229358896">According to the company, product safety is its highest priority. Hasbro uses a five-step quality assurance process that starts with design and then moves to engineering, manufacturing, and packaging. Another key part of product safety at <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hasbro</span> is incorporating continuous feedback from both consumers and retailers and insisting that these high standards and quality processes apply to all third-party factories worldwide that manufacture its products.</p>
<p id="auto_288104a9-b9b5-45f7-85e6-5cf074dc65b9_fs-idm226565136"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hasbro</span> is also committed to finding new ways to reduce its environmental footprint. Over the past several years, the company has reduced energy consumption, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced water consumption and waste production in its production facilities. In addition, Hasbro has totally eliminated the use of wire ties in all of its product packaging, saving more than <em data-effect="italics">34,000</em> miles of wire ties—more than enough to wrap around the earth’s circumference.</p>
<p id="auto_288104a9-b9b5-45f7-85e6-5cf074dc65b9_fs-idm213741856">Human rights and ethical sourcing remains a key ingredient of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hasbro</span>’s CSR success. Treating people fairly is a core company value, as is working diligently to make great strides in diversity and inclusion at all levels of the organization. Company personnel work closely with third-party factories to ensure that the human rights of all workers in the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hasbro</span> global supply chain are recognized and upheld.</p>
<p id="auto_288104a9-b9b5-45f7-85e6-5cf074dc65b9_fs-idm204060768">Philanthropy, corporate giving, and employee volunteering are key components of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hasbro</span> community. Through its various charitable programs, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hasbro</span> made close to $15 million in financial contributions and product donations in 2016, which reached close to an estimated 4 million children around the globe. Several years ago the company started an annual Global Day of Joy as a way of engaging its employees worldwide in community service. In a recent year, more than 93 percent of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hasbro</span>’s employees participated in service projects in more than 40 countries.</p>

</div><p id="auto_288104a9-b9b5-45f7-85e6-5cf074dc65b9_fs-idm222942784">Every day, managers and business owners make business decisions based on what they believe to be right and wrong. Through their actions, they demonstrate to their employees what is and is not acceptable behavior and shape the moral standard of the organization. As you will see in this module, personal and professional ethics are important cornerstones of an organization and shape its ultimate contributions to society in the form of corporate social responsibility. First, let’s consider how individual business ethics are formed.</p>

<li>What philosophies and concepts shape personal ethical standards?</li>

<p id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm338455632"><span data-type="term">Ethics</span> is a set of moral standards for judging whether something is right or wrong. The first step in understanding business ethics is learning to recognize an <span data-type="term">ethical issue</span>. An ethical issue is a situation where someone must choose between a set of actions that may be ethical or unethical. For example, Martin <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Shkreli</span>, former CEO of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Turing Pharmaceuticals</span>, raised the price of a drug used for newborns and HIV patients by more than <em data-effect="italics">5000</em> percent, defending the price increase as a “great business decision.”<a href="#auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_rfin-ch02_1" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_rfin-ch02_1">Renae Merle, “‘Pharma Bro’ Martin Shkreli Goes on Trial, Where He Finds Another Kind of Limelight,” <em data-effect="italics">Washington Post,</em> https://www.washingtonpost.com, June 27, 2017.</div></a> Few people would call that ethical behavior. But consider the actions of the stranded, hungry people in New Orleans who lost everything in the aftermath of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hurricane Katrina</span>. They broke into flooded stores, taking food and bottled water without paying for them. Was this unethical behavior? Or what about the small Texas plastics manufacturer that employed over 100 people and specialized in the Latin American market? The president was distraught because he knew the firm would be bankrupt by the end of the year if it didn’t receive more contracts. He knew that he was losing business because he refused to pay bribes. Bribes were part of the culture in his major markets. Closing the firm would put many people out of work. Should he start paying bribes in order to stay in business? Would this be unethical? Let’s look at the next section to obtain some guidance on recognizing unethical situations.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm340654096"><h3 data-type="title">Recognizing Unethical Business Activities</h3>
<p id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm338954800">Researchers from Brigham Young University tell us that all unethical business activities will fall into one of the following categories:</p>
<ol id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm338763584">
<li><em data-effect="italics">Taking things that don’t belong to you.</em> The unauthorized use of someone else’s property or taking property under false pretenses is taking something that does not belong to you. Even the smallest offense, such as using the postage meter at your office for mailing personal letters or exaggerating your travel expenses, belongs in this category of ethical violations.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Saying things you know are not true.</em> Often, when trying for a promotion and advancement, fellow employees discredit their coworkers. Falsely assigning blame or inaccurately reporting conversations is lying. Although “This is the way the game is played around here” is a common justification, saying things that are untrue is an ethical violation.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Giving or allowing false impressions.</em> The salesperson who permits a potential customer to believe that cardboard boxes will hold the customer’s tomatoes for long-distance shipping when the salesperson knows the boxes are not strong enough has given a false impression. A car dealer who fails to disclose that a car has been in an accident is misleading potential customers.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Buying influence or engaging in a conflict of interest.</em> A conflict of interest occurs when the official responsibilities of an employee or government official are influenced by the potential for personal gain. Suppose a company awards a construction contract to a firm owned by the father of the state attorney general while the state attorney general’s office is investigating that company. If this construction award has the potential to shape the outcome of the investigation, a conflict of interest has occurred.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Hiding or divulging information.</em> Failing to disclose the results of medical studies that indicate your firm’s new drug has significant side effects is the ethical violation of hiding information that the product could be harmful to purchasers. Taking your firm’s product development or trade secrets to a new place of employment constitutes the ethical violation of divulging proprietary information.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Taking unfair advantage.</em> Many current consumer protection laws were passed because so many businesses took unfair advantage of people who were not educated or were unable to discern the nuances of complex contracts. Credit disclosure requirements, truth-in-lending provisions, and new regulations on auto leasing all resulted because businesses misled consumers who could not easily follow the jargon of long, complex agreements.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Committing improper personal behavior.</em> Although the ethical aspects of an employee’s right to privacy are still debated, it has become increasingly clear that personal conduct outside the job can influence performance and company reputation. Thus, a company driver must abstain from substance abuse because of safety issues. Even the traditional company holiday party and summer picnic have come under scrutiny due to the possibility that employees at and following these events might harm others through alcohol-related accidents.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Abusing power and mistreating individuals.</em> Suppose a manager sexually harasses an employee or subjects employees to humiliating corrections or reprimands in the presence of customers. In some cases, laws protect employees. Many situations, however, are simply interpersonal abuse that constitutes an ethical violation.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Permitting organizational abuse.</em> Many U.S. firms with operations overseas, such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Apple</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nike</span>, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Levi Strauss</span>, have faced issues of organizational abuse. The unfair treatment of workers in international operations appears in the form of child labor, demeaning wages, and excessive work hours. Although a business cannot change the culture of another country, it can perpetuate—or stop—abuse through its operations there.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Violating rules.</em> Many organizations use rules and processes to maintain internal controls or respect the authority of managers. Although these rules may seem burdensome to employees trying to serve customers, a violation may be considered an unethical act.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Condoning unethical actions.</em> What if you witnessed a fellow employee embezzling company funds by forging her signature on a check? Would you report the violation? A winking tolerance of others’ unethical behavior is itself unethical.<a href="#auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_rfin-ch02_2" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_rfin-ch02_2">Arthur Schwartz, “The 5 Most Common Unethical Behaviors in the Workplace,” <em data-effect="italics">Philadelphia Business Journal,</em> http://www.bizjournals.com, January 26, 2015; Marianne Moody Jennings, <em data-effect="italics">Case Studies in Business Ethics,</em> 2nd edition (St. Paul: West Publishing Company, 1996), pp. xx–xxii.</div></a></li>

<p id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm353393872">After recognizing that a situation is unethical, the next question is what do you do? The action that a person takes is partially based upon his or her ethical philosophy. The environment in which we live and work also plays a role in our behavior. This section describes personal philosophies and legal factors that influence the choices we make when confronting an ethical dilemma.</p>

<p id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm354239344">Another factor influencing individual business ethics is <span data-type="term">justice</span>, or what is fair according to prevailing standards of society. We all expect life to be reasonably fair. You expect your exams to be fair, the grading to be fair, and your wages to be fair, based on the type of work being done.</p>
<p id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm354960192">Today we take justice to mean an equitable distribution of the burdens and rewards that society has to offer. The distributive process varies from society to society. Those in a democratic society believe in the “equal pay for equal work” doctrine, in which individuals are rewarded based on the value the free market places on their services. Because the market places different values on different occupations, the rewards, such as wages, are not necessarily equal. Nevertheless, many regard the rewards as just. A politician who argued that a supermarket clerk should receive the same pay as a physician, for example, would not receive many votes from the American people. At the other extreme, communist theorists have argued that justice would be served by a society in which burdens and rewards were distributed to individuals according to their abilities and their needs, respectively.</p>

<p id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm341224304">One of the philosophies that may influence choices between right and wrong is <span data-type="term">utilitarianism</span>, which focuses on the consequences of an action taken by a person or organization. The notion that people should act so as to generate the greatest good for the greatest number is derived from utilitarianism. When an action affects the majority adversely, it is morally wrong. One problem with this philosophy is that it is nearly impossible to accurately determine how a decision will affect a large number of people.</p>
<p id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm350998112">Another problem is that utilitarianism always involves both winners and losers. If sales are slowing and a manager decides to fire five people rather than putting everyone on a 30-hour workweek, the 20 people who keep their full-time jobs are winners, but the other five are losers.</p>
<p id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm340804720">A final criticism of utilitarianism is that some “costs,” although small relative to the potential good, are so negative that some segments of society find them unacceptable. Reportedly, the backs of animals a year are deliberately broken so that scientists can conduct spinal cord research that could someday lead to a cure for spinal cord injuries. To a number of people, however, the “costs” are simply too horrible for this type of research to continue.</p>

<p id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm340596784">The philosophy that says people should meet their obligations and duties when analyzing an ethical dilemma is called <span data-type="term">deontology</span>. This means that a person will follow his or her obligations to another individual or society because upholding one’s duty is what is considered ethically correct. For instance, people who follow this philosophy will always keep their promises to a friend and will follow the law. They will produce very consistent decisions, because they will be based on the individual’s set duties. Note that this theory is not necessarily concerned with the welfare of others. Say, for example, a technician for <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Orkin Pest Control</span> has decided that it’s his ethical duty (and is very practical) to always be on time to meetings with homeowners. Today he is running late. How is he supposed to drive? Is the technician supposed to speed, breaking his duty to society to uphold the law, or is he supposed to arrive at the client’s home late, breaking his duty to be on time? This scenario of conflicting obligations does not lead us to a clear ethically correct resolution, nor does it protect the welfare of others from the technician’s decision.</p>

<p id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm322023952">In our society, individuals and groups have certain rights that exist under certain conditions regardless of any external circumstances. These rights serve as guides when making individual ethical decisions. The term <em data-effect="italics">human rights</em> implies that certain rights—to life, to freedom, to the pursuit of happiness—are bestowed at birth and cannot be arbitrarily taken away. Denying the rights of an individual or group is considered to be unethical and illegal in most, though not all, parts of the world. Certain rights are guaranteed by the government and its laws, and these are considered <em data-effect="italics">legal rights.</em> The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">U.S. Constitution</span> and its amendments, as well as state and federal statutes, define the rights of American citizens. Those rights can be disregarded only in extreme circumstances, such as during wartime. Legal rights include the freedom of religion, speech, and assembly; protection from improper arrest and searches and seizures; and proper access to counsel, confrontation of witnesses, and cross-examination in criminal prosecutions. Also held to be fundamental is the right to privacy in many matters. Legal rights are to be applied without regard to race, color, creed, gender, or ability.</p>

</ol>
<p id="auto_477e5fb4-3434-42df-b181-8e44117aa5c0_fs-idm340362688">Ethics is a set of moral standards for judging whether something is right or wrong. A utilitarianism approach to setting personal ethical standards focuses on the consequences of an action taken by a person or organization. According to this approach, people should act so as to generate the greatest good for the greatest number. Every human is entitled to certain rights such as freedom and the pursuit of happiness. Another approach to ethical decision-making is justice, or what is fair according to accepted standards.</p>

</ol>

<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm340436272">People choose between right and wrong based on their personal code of ethics. They are also influenced by the ethical environment created by their employers. Consider the following headlines:</p>

<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm341089920">As these actual stories illustrate, poor business ethics can create a very negative image for a company, can be expensive for the firm and/or the executives involved, and can result in bankruptcy and jail time for the offenders. Organizations can reduce the potential for these types of liability claims by educating their employees about ethical standards, by leading through example, and through various informal and formal programs.</p>

<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm339602608">Employees often follow the examples set by their managers. That is, leaders and managers establish patterns of behavior that determine what’s acceptable and what’s not within the organization. While Ben Cohen was president of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Ben &amp; Jerry’s</span> ice cream, he followed a policy that no one could earn a salary more than seven times that of the lowest-paid worker. He wanted all employees to feel that they were equal. At the time he resigned, company sales were $140 million, and the lowest-paid worker earned $19,000 per year. Ben Cohen’s salary was $133,000, based on the “seven times” rule. A typical top executive of a $140 million company might have earned 10 times Cohen’s salary. Ben Cohen’s actions helped shape the ethical values of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Ben &amp; Jerry’s</span>.</p>

<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm336301296">In addition to providing a system to resolve ethical dilemmas, organizations also provide formal training to develop an awareness of questionable business activities and practice appropriate responses.

<td>Bill Gannon was a middle manager of a large manufacturer of lighting fixtures in Newark, New Jersey. Bill had moved up the company ladder rather quickly and seemed destined for upper management in a few years. Bill’s boss, Dana Johnson, had been pressuring them about the semiannual reviews concerning Robert Talbot, one of Bill’s employees. Dana, it seemed, would not accept any negative comments on Robert’s evaluation forms. Bill had found out that a previous manager who had given Robert a bad evaluation was no longer with the company. As Bill reviewed Robert’s performance for the forthcoming evaluation period, they found many areas of subpar performance. Moreover, a major client had called recently complaining that Robert had filled a large order improperly and then had been rude to the client when she called to complain.</td>

<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm350460688">Most large companies and thousands of smaller ones have created, printed, and distributed codes of ethics. In general, a <span data-type="term">code of ethics</span> provides employees with the knowledge of what their firm expects in terms of their responsibilities and behavior toward fellow employees, customers, and suppliers. Some ethical codes offer a lengthy and detailed set of guidelines for employees. Others are not really codes at all but rather summary statements of goals, policies, and priorities. Some companies have their codes framed and hung on office walls, included as a key component of employee handbooks, and/or posted on their corporate websites.</p>
<div data-type="list" id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm330175856"><div data-type="title" id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_1">Examples of company codes of ethics:</div><ul data-bullet-style="none" class="no-style"><li><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Costco</span> http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=83830&amp;p=irol-govhighlights</li>

</ul></div><p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm335329456">Do codes of ethics make employees behave in a more ethical manner? Some people believe that they do. Others think that they are little more than public relations gimmicks. If senior management abides by the code of ethics and regularly emphasizes the code to employees, then it will likely have a positive influence on behavior.</p>

<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm340683296">The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Campbell Soup Company</span> is no longer just about traditional cans of processed soup. Under the guidance of its management team, particularly its former CEO Denise Morrison (Morrison retired from Campbell’s in July of 2018), Campbell’s has undergone a transformation that includes a strong emphasis on organics and fresh food—and a large serving of corporate citizenship.</p>
<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm354347440">Named one of the Best Corporate Citizens by <em data-effect="italics">Corporate Responsibility</em> magazine in 2017, Campbell’s is working to make sustainability and transparency part of its business DNA, and this culture shift has had an important influence on the company’s business strategies.</p>
<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm345763424">Morrison, who took over as CEO in 2011, is a firm believer in the company’s central vision: real food that matters for life’s moments. “We can make a profit and make a difference, and we are doing both through our business . . . in a way that’s authentic, that’s transparent, and that truly matters,” she explains.</p>
<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm336596864">Under Morrison’s watch, the company recently acquired several fresh food and organic companies, including <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bolthouse Farms</span>, one of the largest suppliers of fresh carrots in the United States, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Garden Fresh Gourmet</span>, which produces a top line of fresh salsa and hummus. Tracking the strong change in consumer preference for healthier food, Campbell’s also recently acquired <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Plum Organics</span>, a line of organic baby food products, which should help solidify the company’s reputation for fresh ingredients with millennials and their families.</p>
<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm339905952">The company’s transformation from a processed food giant to a major competitor in the fresh food business has also had a positive influence on the company’s bottom line. Campbell’s shareholders have to be pleased with the 20 percent increase in the company’s stock price over the past two years, as the markets, competitors, and consumers take notice of the company’s strong commitment to sustainability.</p>
<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm333579536">Inherent in the company’s reinvention is the strong emphasis on corporate citizenship—doing good and giving back seem to be top priorities for Campbell’s. In addition to acquiring sustainable and fresh food companies, Campbell’s has also made a conscious decision to support the communities where their employees live and work. For example, the company launched a healthy communities initiative in Camden, New Jersey, where Campbell’s is headquartered—an urban city that has seen its share of economic and social challenges in the past. In partnership with several local organizations, this initiative has helped fund community gardens, food pantries, nutrition education, and cooking classes that help build healthy communities. The Camden experience has been so successful that the company has expanded the program to other cities where it operates, including Detroit, Michigan, and Norwalk, Connecticut.</p>
<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm340089792">The company’s ongoing commitment to fresh food, community involvement, and corporate social responsibility has helped change the narrative when it comes to being a sustainable and ethical organization.</p>

<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm350797344">In many situations, there may be no simple right or wrong answers. Yet there are several questions you can ask yourself, and a couple of self-tests you can do, to help you make the right ethical decision. First, ask yourself, “Are there any legal restrictions or violations that will result from the action?” If so, take a different course of action. If not, ask yourself, “Does it violate my company’s code of ethics?” If so, again find a different path to follow. Third, ask, “Does this meet the guidelines of my own ethical philosophy?” If the answer is “yes,” then your decision must still pass two important tests.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm351530416"><h4 data-type="title">The Feelings Test</h4>
<p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm351533680">You must now ask, “How does it make me feel?” This enables you to examine your comfort level with a particular decision. Many people find that, after reaching a decision on an issue, they still experience discomfort that may manifest itself in a loss of sleep or appetite. Those feelings of conscience can serve as a future guide in resolving ethical dilemmas.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm335285872"><h4 data-type="title">The Newspaper or Social Media Test</h4><p id="auto_01fded49-edbc-441d-b9fe-65b1a314a3df_fs-idm350451136">The final test involves the front page of the newspaper or social media posts. The question to be asked is how an objective reporter would describe your decision in a front-page newspaper story, an online media site, or a social media platform such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Twitter</span> or <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Facebook</span>. Some managers rephrase the test for their employees: How will the headline read if I make this decision, or what will be the reaction of my social media followers? This test is helpful in spotting and resolving potential conflicts of interest.</p>

The question to ask yourself is how the decision would make you feel if an objective reporter described the decision on the front page of a newspaper or via a social media post on Twitter or Facebook—all of which would be viewed by many, many people. Speaking of social media, it plays a pivotal role in ethical decision-making today, when people use the medium to share critical comments about friends as well as employers, business colleagues, and competitors. <em data-effect="italics">Should companies view employees’ social media pages on a regular basis, or is that information off-limits to employers?</em> (Credit: Mike MacKenzie/ Flickr/ Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0))</figcaption>

<li>What is corporate social responsibility?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm339344992">Acting in an ethical manner is one of the four components of the pyramid of <span data-type="term">corporate social responsibility (CSR)</span><strong data-effect="bold">,</strong> which is the concern of businesses for the welfare of society as a whole. It consists of obligations beyond those required by law or union contract. This definition makes two important points. First, CSR is voluntary. Beneficial action required by law, such as cleaning up factories that are polluting air and water, is not voluntary. Second, the obligations of corporate social responsibility are broad. They extend beyond investors in the company to include workers, suppliers, consumers, communities, and society at large.</p>

<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm340841056"><strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm336685184" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong> portrays economic responsibility as the foundation for the other three responsibilities. At the same time that a business pursues profits (economic responsibility), however, it is expected to obey the law (legal responsibility); to do what is right, just, and fair (ethical responsibility); and to be a good corporate citizen (philanthropic responsibility). These four components are distinct but together constitute the whole. Still, if the company doesn’t make a profit, then the other three responsibilities won’t matter.</p>

<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm321714224">Many companies continue to work hard to make the world a better place to live. Recent data suggests that Fortune 500 companies spend more than $15 billion annually on CSR activities. Consider the following examples:</p>

<ul id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm336075360">
<li><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Starbucks</span> has donated more than one million meals to local communities via its FoodShare program and alliance with Feeding America, giving 100 percent of leftover food from their seven thousand U.S. company-owned stores.</li>
<li><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Salesforce</span> encourages its employees to volunteer in community activities and pays them for doing so, up to 56 paid hours every year.

<li>Employees who work for <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Deloitte</span>, a global audit, consulting, and financial services organization, can get paid for up to 48 hours of volunteer work each year.

<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm331980128">The idea of corporate social responsibility is so widespread today that it is hard to conceive of a company continually acting in illegal and irresponsible ways. Nevertheless, such actions do sometimes occur, which can create financial ruin for organizations, extreme financial hardships for many former employees, and general struggles for the communities in which they operate. Unfortunately, top executives still walk away with millions. Some, however, will ultimately pay large fines and spend time in prison for their actions. Federal, state, and local laws determine whether an activity is legal or not. The laws that regulate business are discussed later in this module.</p>

<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm339602608">Sometimes companies act irresponsibly, yet their actions are legal. For example, the Minnesota-based company that makes <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">MyPillow</span> was recently fined $1 million by the state of California for making unsubstantiated claims that the “most comfortable pillow you’ll ever own” could help alleviate medical conditions such as snoring, fibromyalgia, migraines, and other disorders. The company’s CEO countered that the claims were actually made by customers; these testimonials were posted on the company’s website but later removed. In addition to the fine, the company faced several class-action lawsuits, and the Better Business Bureau has revoked <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">MyPillow</span>’s accreditation.<a href="#auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_rfin-ch02_7" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_rfin-ch02_7">John Ewoldt, “Better Business Bureau Revokes MyPillow Accreditation over Ad Dispute,” <em data-effect="italics">Minneapolis Star Tribune,</em> http://www.startribune.com, January 4, 2017; Herb Weisbaum, “Full of Fluff?

<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm349468272">As a carpenter, Bill Whyte was always looking for a solution to his dry, cracked hands, especially in the harsh New Hampshire winters. After trying many commercial lotions that didn’t really work, Whyte experimented with olive oil and beeswax to come up with a soothing balm to help heal rough hands. Mixing up the concoction at home, Whyte came up with a product that seemed to work and was made from natural ingredients.</p>
<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm330233008">Originally called Bear Paw, the lotion became known as Badger Balm after a friend found a competing product already named Bear Paw. Whyte set up a production line at home to fill the tins. Soon he was pounding the pavement in the town of Gilsum, trying to sell the new product to hardware stores, lumber yards, and health food stores.</p>
<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm321994272">Fast-forward a little more than 20 years from his early days of experimentation, and Whyte (affectionately known as the “head badger”) runs W.S. Badger Company with the same goals and passions he started with back in the mid-1990s. The company uses only organic plant extracts, exotic oils, beeswax, and minerals to make the most effective products to soothe, heal, and protect the body. And the natural ingredients come from all over the world—for example, organic extra virgin olive oil from Spain, organic rose essential oil from Bulgaria, and bergamot oil from southern Italy.</p>
<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm352646416"> Badger’s homey culture is no accident. In fact, in the early days, Whyte made soup every Friday for the small staff. Today, Whyte and family members, including his wife Kathy, chief operating officer; daughter Rebecca, head of sustainability and innovation; and daughter Emily, head of sales and marketing, all embrace the ethical and social principles of this family business that have made the company a success.</p>
<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm350408976">To reinforce the commitment of being socially responsible and demonstrating transparency, W.S. Badger Company became a Certified Benefit Corporation, or B Corp for short. This certification requires companies to meet rigorous standards for transparency, accountability, and social and environmental performance. (Benefit Corporations are discussed in more detail later in this module.)</p>
<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm354460848">Becoming a B Corp. has helped the company organize how it operates. For example, pay for the highest-paid full-time employee is capped at five times that of the lowest paid, which is now $15 an hour (more than double New Hampshire’s minimum wage); a portion of company profits flows to employees via profit sharing, and all employees participate in a bonus plan; and new parents are encouraged to bring their babies to work, a program that has helped foster a new style of teamwork for the entire organization, as well as increase employee morale. In addition, Badger donates 10 percent of its pre-tax profits annually to nonprofit organizations that focus on the health and welfare of children, matches employee contributions to charitable causes (up to $100 per employee), and donates an additional $50 to a nonprofit chosen by each employee on their birthday.</p>
<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm350463728">Badger staff, which now number more than 100, enjoy a living wage, great benefits, and a socially responsible work environment thanks to a visionary who found an eco-friendly way to soothe his rough hands and created an ethical business as part of his journey.</p>

<p id="auto_2641e205-6ab3-4ec5-9b09-1ccd1145063c_fs-idm339040000">Corporate social responsibility is the concern of businesses for the welfare of society as a whole. It consists of obligations beyond just making a profit and goes beyond what is required by law or union contract. Companies may engage in illegal and irresponsible behavior, irresponsible but legal behavior, or legal and responsible behavior. The vast majority of organizations act legally and try to be socially responsible.</p>

Such a company meets its obligations to its stakeholders. <span data-type="term">Stakeholders</span> are the individuals or groups to whom a business has a responsibility. The stakeholders of a business are its employees, its customers, the general public, and its investors.</p>

<p id="auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_fs-idm206249056">An organization’s first responsibility is to provide a job to employees. Keeping people employed and letting them have time to enjoy the fruits of their labor is the finest thing business can do for society. Beyond this fundamental responsibility, employers must provide a clean, safe working environment that is free from all forms of discrimination. Companies should also strive to provide job security whenever possible.</p>
<p id="auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_fs-idm212981472">Enlightened firms are also empowering employees to make decisions on their own and suggest solutions to company problems. Empowerment contributes to an employee’s self-worth, which, in turn, increases productivity and reduces absenteeism.</p>
<p id="auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_fs-idm231023264">Each year, in collaboration with Great Place to Work<sup>®</sup>, <em data-effect="italics">Fortune</em> conducts an extensive employee survey of the best places to work in the United States.

A firm must deliver what it promises, as well as be honest and forthright in everyday interactions with customers, suppliers, and others.

The world’s forests are being destroyed fast. Every second, an area the size of a football field is laid bare. Plant and animal species are becoming extinct at the rate of 17 per hour.

Berry learned the majority of seafood consumed in the United States was being imported from other countries and more than 90 percent of U.S. seafood was being exported. In addition, great harm was being done to the ocean because it was being overfished.</p>
<p id="auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_fs-idm226543904">Although several groups were already working to improve the commercial fishing industry, he observed that one key group was not part of the discussion: consumers. Berry decided a key component of change had to be involving consumers in the process. He spent more than a year meeting with everyone involved in the Oregon fishing industry—from fishermen to processors, distributors, truck drivers, chefs, and consumers—to gain perspective on why the industry was failing. His “aha” moment occurred when he realized the majority of fish is consumed in restaurants because consumers think preparing fish at home is too difficult and time-consuming. That’s when he co-founded <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Fishpeople Seafood</span>.</p>
<p id="auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_fs-idm229605344">Started in 2012, Fishpeople has a mission of changing the way people think about seafood by being transparent about where the seafood comes from, how it is processed, and how it is handled. Berry believes the company’s transparency helps consumers understand how the process translates into sustainable food that tastes good and is good for you. The company makes shelf-stable, ready-to-eat restaurant-quality seafood in the form of soups, meal kits, and fresh and frozen filets, complete with farm-to-table ingredients. On every package there is a code consumers can enter at the company’s website that will tell them everything about the seafood’s origin, down to the fisherman who caught it. Fishpeople also operates a processing plant in Toledo, Oregon, where workers are paid a livable wage and receive health insurance—benefits typically unheard of in the fishing industry.</p>
<p id="auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_fs-idm226781584">Fishpeople’s products are available in more than 5,000 stores nationwide, including <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Walmart</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Whole Foods</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Costco</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Kroger</span>, and other grocery stores and markets.

<p id="auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_fs-idm232533024">Companies’ relationships with investors also entail social responsibility. Although a company’s economic responsibility to make a profit might seem to be its main obligation to its shareholders, some investors increasingly are putting more emphasis on other aspects of social responsibility.</p>
<p id="auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_fs-idm232643072">Some investors are limiting their investments to securities (e.g., stocks and bonds) that coincide with their beliefs about ethical and social responsibility. This is called <span data-type="term">social investing</span>. For example, a social investment fund might eliminate from consideration the securities of all companies that make tobacco products or liquor, manufacture weapons, or have a history of being environmentally irresponsible. Not all social investment strategies are alike. Some ethical mutual funds will not invest in government securities because they help to fund the military; others freely buy government securities, with managers noting that federal funds also support the arts and pay for AIDS research. Today, assets invested using socially responsible strategies total more than $7 trillion.<a href="#auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_rfin-ch02_16" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_rfin-ch02_16">Nellie S.

<p id="auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_fs-idm230390864">Perhaps partly as the result of the global recession of 2007–2009, over the last several years companies have tried to meet responsibilities to their investors as well as to their other stakeholders. Recent research suggests that now more than ever, CEOs are being held to higher standards by boards of directors, investors, governments, media, and even employees when it comes to corporate accountability and ethical behavior. A recent global study by PwC reveals that over the last several years, there has been a large increase in the number of CEOs being forced out due to some sort of ethical lapse in their organizations. Strategies to prevent such missteps should include establishing a culture of integrity to prevent anyone from breaking the rules, making sure company goals and metrics do not create undue pressure on employees to cut corners, and implementing effective processes and controls to minimize the opportunity for unethical behavior.<a href="#auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_rfin-ch02_17" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_33ca0b7d-3794-431c-86f2-968d213067f3_rfin-ch02_17">Per-Ola Karlsson, DeAnne Aquirre, and Kristin Rivera, “Are CEOs Less Ethical Than in the Past?” <em data-effect="italics">Strategy + Business,</em> https://www.strategy-business.com, accessed June 27, 2017; Emily C.

They should provide a clean, safe working environment. Organizations can build employees’ self-worth through empowerment programs. Businesses also have a responsibility to customers to provide good, safe products and services. Organizations are responsible to the general public to be good corporate citizens. Firms must help protect the environment and provide a good place to work. Companies also engage in corporate philanthropy, which includes contributing cash, donating goods and services, and supporting volunteer efforts of employees. Finally, companies are responsible to investors. They should earn a reasonable profit for company owners.</p>

<li>What are the trends in ethics and corporate social responsibility?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm230035536">Three important trends related to ethics and corporate social responsibility are strategic changes in corporate philanthropy, a new social contract between employers and employees, and the growth of global ethics and corporate social responsibility.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm230202192"><h3 data-type="title">Changes in Corporate Philanthropy</h3>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm206298176">Historically, corporate philanthropy has typically involved companies seeking out charitable groups and giving them money or donating company products or services. Today, the focus has shifted to <span data-type="term">strategic giving</span>, which ties philanthropy and corporate social responsibility efforts closely to a company’s mission or goals and targets donations to the communities where a company does business. Some of the top businesses recognized for their efforts in giving back to the communities in which they operate include technology giant Salesforce, San Antonio’s NuStar Energy, insurance and financial services firm Veterans United, and software leader Intuit.<a href="#auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_rfin-ch02_18" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_rfin-ch02_18">“The 50 Best Workplaces for Giving Back,” <em data-effect="italics">Fortune,</em> http://fortune.com, February 9, 2017.</div></a></p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm205684288"><h3 data-type="title">A Social Contract between Employer and Employee</h3>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm230613328">Another trend in social responsibility is the effort by organizations to redefine their relationship with their employees. Many people have viewed social responsibility as a one-way street that focuses on the obligations of business to society, employees, and others. Now, companies recognize that the social contract between employer and employee is an important aspect of the workplace and that both groups have to be committed to working together in order for the organization to prosper. The social contract can be defined in terms of four important aspects: compensation, management, culture, and learning and development.<a href="#auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_rfin-ch02_19" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_rfin-ch02_19">Andie Burjek, Lauren Dixon, Geri Anne Fennessy, and Sarah Fister Gale, “The New Employer-Employee Contract,” <em data-effect="italics">Talent Economy,</em> http://www.talenteconomy.io, May 8, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm225357920">When it comes to compensation, companies today must recognize that most employees do not stay with one organization for decades. Thus, companies need to change their compensation structure to acknowledge the importance of short-term performance and to update their methods for determining compensation, including benefits and other nontraditional perks such as increased paid leave and telecommuting options.</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm232235568">In the current workplace environment, where employees are likely to jump to new jobs every couple years, managers need to take a more active and engaged approach to supervising employees and perhaps change the way they think about loyalty, which may be difficult for managers used to supervising the same group of employees for a long period of time. Engaging employees on a regular basis, setting realistic expectations, and identifying specific development paths may help retain key employees.</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm230753440">Thanks to today’s tight labor market, some employees feel empowered to demand more from their employer and its overall culture via strategies such as increased flexibility, transparency, and fairness. This increased importance of the employee’s role in the company’s culture helps workers stay engaged in the mission of the organization and perhaps makes them less likely to look elsewhere for employment.</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm228605440">Finally, rapidly changing technology used in today’s workplace continues to shift the learning and development component of the employer-employee contract, causing immense challenges to both companies and workers. It may be more difficult to identify the employee skills that will be critical over the next several years, causing employers either to increase training of current workers or to look outside the organization for other individuals who already possess the technical skills needed to get the job done.</p>

<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm225431104">When U.S. businesses expand into global markets, they must take their codes of ethics and policies on corporate social responsibility with them. As a citizen of several countries, a multinational corporation has several responsibilities. These include respecting local practices and customs, ensuring that there is harmony between the organization’s staff and the host population, providing management leadership, and developing a solid group of local managers who will be a credit to their community. When a multinational firm makes an investment in a foreign country, it should commit to a long-term relationship. That means involving all stakeholders in the host country in decision-making. Finally, a responsible multinational will implement ethical guidelines within the organization in the host country. By fulfilling these responsibilities, the company will foster respect for both local and international laws.</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm226925936">Multinational corporations often must balance conflicting interests of stakeholders when making decisions regarding social responsibilities, especially in the area of human rights. Questions involving child labor, forced labor, minimum wages, and workplace safety can be particularly difficult. Recently <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Gap, Inc.</span> decided to publish the list of its global factories in an effort to provide transparency about its suppliers and the efforts the company continues to make to improve working conditions around the world. The company has partnered with <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Verité</span>, a nongovernmental organization focused on ensuring that people work under safe, fair, and legal conditions. By soliciting feedback from factory workers making its products, Gap is hoping to improve working conditions and help these factories become leaders in their local communities.<a href="#auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_rfin-ch02_20" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_rfin-ch02_20">“Global Sustainability: Improving Factory Working Conditions,” http://www.gapincsustainability.com, accessed June 23, 2017; “Gap Inc.

<li>What are the trends in ethics and corporate social responsibility?</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm225945296">Today, corporate philanthropy is shifting away from simply giving to any needy group and is focusing instead on strategic giving, in which the philanthropy relates more closely to the corporate mission or goals and targets donations to areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm213930208">A second trend is toward a new social contract between employer and employee. Instead of the employer having the sole responsibility for maintaining jobs, now the employee must assume part of the burden and find ways to add value to the organization.</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm225448656">As the world increasingly becomes a global community, multinational corporations are now expected to assume a global set of ethics and responsibility. Global companies must understand local customs. They should also involve local stakeholders in decision-making. Multinationals must also make certain that their suppliers are not engaged in human rights violations.</p>

<li>Many CEOs have sold shares of their company’s stock when prices were near their high points. Even though their actions were legal, it soon became apparent that they knew that the stock was significantly overpriced. Was the CEO ethically obligated to tell the public that this was the case—even knowing that doing so could cause the stock price to plummet, thereby hurting someone who bought the stock earlier that day? (Systems)</li>
<li>Jeffrey Immelt, former chairman and CEO of General Electric, one of the world’s most-admired companies according to <em data-effect="italics">Fortune</em> magazine, says that execution, growth, and great people are required to keep the company on top. Immelt said that these are predictable, but a fourth factor is not—virtue, and virtue was at the top of his list.

<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm229667200">The Honest Company is a consumer-goods business that sells nontoxic, eco-friendly items for baby and personal care, household cleaning, and a healthy lifestyle. Cofounded by actress Jessica Alba a little more than six years ago, Honest Co. is built on the promise of “telling all and doing our best to live up to your expectations.”</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm225390640">Over the years the company has received high praise and media buzz about its ethical approach to making products that are not only good for people but good for the environment. On its website, Honest Co. goes to great lengths to share with consumers its guiding principles that products are made without harming people or the planet.</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm222829104">A little over two years ago, however, the company experienced some bad press when <em data-effect="italics">The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that two independent lab tests found samples of Honest laundry detergent contained a cleaning agent on the list of chemicals the company pledged to avoid. At first, pushback from company officials was loud and clear: they denied their products were anything but eco-friendly and safe for consumers and went as far as calling the report “false” and “junk science.”</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm213434688">Unfortunately, the reports about Honest products and their harmful ingredients didn’t go away. After the laundry detergent story faded, the company quietly reconfigured the ingredients that went into the detergent as well as other products. But that wasn’t the end of the story. Several months later, Honest Co. voluntarily recalled organic baby powder that might cause infections and more recently recalled diaper wipes that appeared discolored.</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm230804032">Despite these recent challenges, Honest Co. continues to be successful and was rumored to be on the short list of possible acquisitions for global conglomerates such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Unilever. These consumer-good giants are snapping up smaller, eco-friendly firms that have blossomed into full-fledged ethically and environmentally conscious organizations with strong sales and solid reputations among consumers. Recently, however, Unilever acquired one of Honest Co.’s biggest rivals, Seventh Generation, Inc., leaving Honest Co. to again rethink its business strategies, including hiring a new CEO.</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm230754016"><em data-effect="italics">Using a web search tool, locate information about this topic and then write responses to the following questions. Be sure to support your arguments and cite your sources.</em></p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm217080688"><strong data-effect="bold">Ethical Dilemma:</strong> Do you think the company’s reaction to reports of hazardous ingredients hurt its reputation for honesty and ethical behavior? Do you think the company’s missteps caused Unilever to shy away from acquiring the company? Or, do you take the stance that Alba’s entertainment background played a part in the press going after the company? If you were an advisor to the new CEO, what suggestions would you give him for getting the company back on track, especially when it comes to corporate social responsibility?</p>

<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm229730800">Uber Technologies, Inc. is the world’s largest technology start-up, valued at close to $70 billion. But that doesn’t mean it has been smooth sailing for the ride-hailing company since its start in 2009. Despite disrupting and revolutionizing the transportation industry in a short period of time, Uber’s meteoric rise has caused some shortcuts in organizational structure, corporate culture, and effective HR practices that have left the company with self-inflicted wounds that may take a long time to heal.</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm222837712">Uber has experienced several scandals over the past few years, including drivers demanding to be classified as employees (not contractors), a tool called “greyball” that allows data collected from the Uber app to identify and avoid enforcement officers trying to catch Uber drivers in cities where the service was illegal, and recent resignations of top executives, including the company’s president and the heads of product development and engineering. But nothing has been quite as damaging as a recent blog post by a former female employee, which detailed the inappropriate behavior that seemed to be commonplace in Uber’s workplace culture.</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm226417456">The allegations of sexual harassment put forth by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler were explosive. Detailed in a February 2017 blog post, Fowler says she alerted company HR about her manager’s inappropriate behavior, even taking screenshots of his suggestive emails, but Fowler was told her boss would not be fired for sexual harassment because he was a “high performer” for the company. After Fowler’s story went public, the company hired former U.S. attorney Eric Holder to investigate the allegations and other workplace issues. Holder’s recommendations, which the Uber board of directors unanimously approved, include changes to senior leadership, enhanced oversight by the company’s board, changes to the company’s internal financial and audit controls, revisions to the company’s cultural values, mandatory leadership training for senior executives and other managers, improvements to the overall HR function and complaint process, and the establishment of an employee diversity advisory board. In addition, as the result of a separate investigation, Uber fired more than 20 other people because of harassment claims.</p>
<p id="auto_0e6bf485-abf0-49d2-9486-a6454e7d7edb_fs-idm221952912">With increasing pressure from the company’s board and other investors, CEO Travis Kalanick said he would take a leave of absence while still mourning the unexpected death of his mother in a recent boating accident. However, most board members lost faith that Kalanick would be able to come back after his leave and make things better. At the urging of the board, two venture capitalists were dispatched to Chicago, where Kalanick was interviewing COO candidates, to present him with a letter from five of Uber’s major investors demanding his resignation. After hours of discussion, Kalanick agreed to step down. According to an Uber spokesperson, a committee of 14 executives is running the company until a new CEO is hired.</p>

<li>Do you think installing an experienced female CEO would help the company change its culture and workplace environment? Explain your reasoning.</li>

As executive vice president of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Domino’s</span> Pizza’s international division, Mike Schlater is president of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Domino’s</span> Canada with more than 440 stores. Originally from Ohio, Schlater started his career with <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Domino's</span> as a pizza delivery driver and worked his way up into management. Schlater saved his earnings, and with some help from his brother, he was able to accept the opportunity to have the first international <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Domino's</span> franchise in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1983. Within weeks, Schlater’s store in Canada reached higher sales than his previous store in Ohio had ever attained. However, it was not an easy start. Schlater had to identify the international suppliers and get them approved to sell their products to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Domino's</span>. This shows one of the challenges that organizations face when entering new global markets. To meet quality standards designed to protect a brand, companies must undertake an extensive review of potential new suppliers to ensure consistent product quality. By 2007, Schlater and a partner unified all of the franchises under one corporate umbrella, and Schlater is now president of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Domino's</span> of Canada, Ltd., which operates more than 440 stores located in every province, as well as the Yukon and Northwest Territories.</p>

</figure><p id="auto_6741195b-9ad2-42c5-bf33-fe9848c46583_fs-idm340537728">Such an impressive career path might seem like luck to some, but Schlater achieved his success due to determination and attention to detail. Luck did play a role in a recent event in his live, though. Schlater manages dough in his business but also came into “dough” by winning $250,000 in a lottery. Since Schlater believes in philanthropy, he donated the entire amount to Cardinal Carter High School in his hometown. Over the years, Schlater has donated millions of dollars to foundations and charities, such as The London Health Sciences Foundation, because he now has the ability to indulge after spending decades climbing the corporate ladder at Domino’s Pizza. A father of three, he moved to Essex County from Winnipeg after buying the Domino’s master franchise for Canada. He wanted to live close to the border because one of his daughters was in a private school in Ohio and another was headed to university there.</p>
<p id="auto_6741195b-9ad2-42c5-bf33-fe9848c46583_fs-idm360306928">The master franchisees of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Domino’s</span> Pizza’s international business are individuals or entities who, under a specific licensing agreement with <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Domino’s</span>, control all operations within a specific country. They operate their own stores, set up a distribution infrastructure to transport materials into and throughout the country, and create subfranchisees. One particular benefit of master franchisees is their local knowledge. As discussed in this chapter, a major challenge when opening a business on foreign soil is negotiating the political, cultural, and economic differences of that country. Master franchisees allow Domino’s, and the franchisee, to take advantage of their local expertise in dealing with marketing strategies, political and regulatory issues, and the local labor market. It takes local experience to know, for example, that only 30 percent of the people in Poland have phones, so carryout needs to be the focus of the business; that Turkey has changed its street names three times in the past 30 years, so delivery is much more challenging; or that, in Japanese, there is no word for pepperoni, the most popular topping worldwide. These are just a few of the challenges that <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Domino’s</span> has had to overcome on the road to becoming the worldwide leader in the pizza delivery business. Under the leadership of people like Schlater, and with the help of dedicated, local master franchisees, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Domino’s</span> has been able to not only compete in but to lead the global pizza delivery market.</p>

</ol>

<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm296247648">No longer just an option, having a global vision has become a business imperative. Having a <span data-type="term">global vision</span> means recognizing and reacting to international business opportunities, being aware of threats from foreign competitors in all markets, and effectively using international distribution networks to obtain raw materials and move finished products to the customer.</p>

<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm336693424">U.S. managers must develop a global vision if they are to recognize and react to international business opportunities, as well as remain competitive at home. Often a U.S. firm’s toughest domestic competition comes from foreign companies. Moreover, a global vision enables a manager to understand that customer and distribution networks operate worldwide, blurring geographic and political barriers and making them increasingly irrelevant to business decisions. Over the past three decades, world trade has climbed from $200 billion a year to more than $1.4 trillion.<a href="#auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_rfin-ch03_1" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_rfin-ch03_1">International Trade Administration: US Department of Commerce Website, accessed August 1, 2017. http://tse.export.gov/tse/MapDisplay.aspx.</div></a> U.S. companies play a major role in this growth in world trade, with 113 of the Fortune 500 companies making over 50 percent of their profits outside the United States.

The immediate impacts of these events have included a short-term shrinkage of global trade. Globalization, however, will continue because the world’s major markets are too vitally integrated for globalization to stop.

<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm350563904">International trade improves relationships with friends and allies; helps ease tensions among nations; and—economically speaking—bolsters economies, raises people’s standard of living, provides jobs, and improves the quality of life. The value of international trade is over $16 trillion a year and growing. This section takes a look at some key measures of international trade: exports and imports, the balance of trade, the balance of payments, and exchange rates.</p>

<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm336052400">The developed nations (those with mature communication, financial, educational, and distribution systems) are the major players in international trade. They account for about 70 percent of the world’s exports and imports. <span data-type="term">Exports</span> are goods and services made in one country and sold to others. <span data-type="term">Imports</span> are goods and services that are bought from other countries. The United States is both the largest exporter and the largest importer in the world.</p>
<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm338861792">Each year the United States exports more food, animal feed, and beverages than the year before. A third of U.S. farm acreage is devoted to crops for export. The United States is also a major exporter of engineering products and other high-tech goods, such as computers and telecommunications equipment. For more than 60,000 U.S. companies (the majority of them small), international trade offers exciting and profitable opportunities. Among the largest U.S. exporters are <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Apple</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">General Motors</span> Corp., <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Ford</span> Motor Co., <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Procter &amp; Gamble</span>, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Cisco Systems</span>.<a href="#auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_rfin-ch03_10" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_rfin-ch03_10">Daniel Workman, “Top 10 Major Export Companies,” http://www.worldtopexports.com, accessed July 4, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm351549120">Despite our impressive list of resources and great variety of products, imports to the United States are also growing. Some of these imports are raw materials that we lack, such as manganese, cobalt, and bauxite, which are used to make airplane parts, exotic metals, and military hardware. More modern factories and lower labor costs in other countries make it cheaper to import industrial supplies (such as steel) and production equipment than to produce them at home. Most of Americans’ favorite hot beverages—coffee, tea, and cocoa—are imported. Lower manufacturing costs have resulted in huge increases in imports from China.</p>

<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm350966064">The difference between the value of a country’s exports and the value of its imports during a specific time is the country’s <span data-type="term">balance of trade</span>. A country that exports more than it imports is said to have a <em data-effect="italics">favorable</em> balance of trade, called a <span data-type="term">trade surplus</span>. A country that imports more than it exports is said to have an <em data-effect="italics">unfavorable</em> balance of trade, or a <span data-type="term">trade deficit</span>. When imports exceed exports, more money from trade flows out of the country than flows into it.</p>
<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm350905392">Although U.S. exports have been booming, we still import more than we export. We have had an unfavorable balance of trade throughout the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. In 2016, our exports totaled $2.2 trillion, yet our imports were $2.7 trillion. Thus, in 2016 the United States had a trade deficit of $500 billion.<a href="#auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_rfin-ch03_11" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_rfin-ch03_11">“U.S. Exports and Imports,” https://www.thebalance.com, accessed June 26, 2017.</div></a> America’s exports continue to grow, but not as fast as our imports: The export of goods, such as computers, trucks, and airplanes, is very strong. The sector that is lagging in significant growth is the export of services. Although America exports many services—ranging from airline trips to education of foreign students to legal advice—part of the problem is due to piracy, which leads companies to restrict the distribution of their services to certain regions. The FBI estimates that the theft of intellectual property from products, books and movies, and pharmaceuticals totals in the billions every year.<a href="#auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_rfin-ch03_12" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_rfin-ch03_12">“What We Investigate: International Property Theft/Piracy,” https://www.fbi.gov, accessed June 26, 2017.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm314673520">Another measure of international trade is called the <span data-type="term">balance of payments</span>, which is a summary of a country’s international financial transactions showing the difference between the country’s total payments to and its total receipts from other countries. The balance of payments includes imports and exports (balance of trade), long-term investments in overseas plants and equipment, government loans to and from other countries, gifts and foreign aid, military expenditures made in other countries, and money transfers in and out of foreign banks.</p>
<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm330186656">From 1900 until 1970, the United States had a trade surplus, but in the other areas that make up the balance of payments, U.S. payments exceeded receipts, largely due to the large U.S. military presence abroad. Hence, almost every year since 1950, the United States has had an unfavorable balance of payments. And since 1970, both the balance of payments <em data-effect="italics">and</em> the balance of trade have been unfavorable. What can a nation do to reduce an unfavorable balance of payments? It can foster exports, reduce its dependence on imports, decrease its military presence abroad, or reduce foreign investment. The U.S. balance of payments deficit was over $504 billion in 2016.<a href="#auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_rfin-ch03_13" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_rfin-ch03_13">“International Economic Accounts,” https://www.bea.gov/International/index.htm, accessed July 17, 2017.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm350883632">The exchange rate is the price of one country’s currency in terms of another country’s currency. If a country’s currency <em data-effect="italics">appreciates</em>, less of that country’s currency is needed to buy another country’s currency. If a country’s currency <em data-effect="italics">depreciates</em>, more of that currency will be needed to buy another country’s currency.</p>
<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm349833680">How do appreciation and depreciation affect the prices of a country’s goods? If, say, the U.S. dollar depreciates relative to the Japanese yen, U.S. residents have to pay more dollars to buy Japanese goods. To illustrate, suppose the dollar price of a yen is $0.012 and that a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Toyota</span> is priced at 2 million yen. At this exchange rate, a U.S. resident pays $24,000 for a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Toyota</span> ($0.012 × 2 million yen = $24,000). If the dollar depreciates to $0.018 to one yen, then the U.S. resident will have to pay $36,000 for a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Toyota</span>.</p>
<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm340111792">As the dollar depreciates, the prices of Japanese goods rise for U.S. residents, so they buy fewer Japanese goods—thus, U.S. imports decline. At the same time, as the dollar depreciates relative to the yen, the yen appreciates relative to the dollar. This means prices of U.S. goods fall for the Japanese, so they buy more U.S. goods—and U.S. exports rise.</p>
<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm350908880">Currency markets operate under a system called <span data-type="term">floating exchange rates</span>. Prices of currencies “float” up and down based upon the demand for and supply of each currency. Global currency traders create the supply of and demand for a particular currency based on that currency’s investment, trade potential, and economic strength. If a country decides that its currency is not properly valued in international currency markets, the government may step in and adjust the currency’s value. In a <span data-type="term">devaluation</span>, a nation lowers the value of its currency relative to other currencies. This makes that country’s exports cheaper and should, in turn, help the balance of payments.</p>
<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm333467200">In other cases, a country’s currency may be undervalued, giving its exports an unfair competitive advantage. Many people believe that China’s huge trade surplus with the United States is partially because China’s currency was undervalued. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a fact sheet detailing how it accused China of dumping steel on the U.S. market as well as providing financial assistance to Chinese companies to produce, manufacture, and export stainless steel to the United States from the People’s Republic of China.<a href="#auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_rfin-ch03_14" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_rfin-ch03_14">“Fact Sheet: Commerce Finds Dumping and Countervailable Subsidies of Imports of Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip from the People’s Republic of China,” http://enforcement.trade.gov, accessed June 26, 2017.</div></a></p>

<li>Why is global trade important to the United States, and how is it measured?</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm338367952">International trade improves relations with friends and allies, eases tensions among nations, helps bolster economies, raises people’s standard of living, and improves the quality of life. The United States is still the largest importer and exporter in the world. We export a fifth of our industrial production and about a third of our farm crops.</p>
<p id="auto_b72c1b62-4a59-4182-8128-d9860bc7a0fe_fs-idm340380608">Two concepts important to global trade are the balance of trade (the difference in value between a country’s exports and its imports over some period) and the balance of payments (the difference between a country’s total payments to other countries and its total receipts from other countries). The United States now has both a negative balance of trade and a negative balance of payments. Another important concept is the exchange rate, which is the price of one country’s currency in terms of another country’s currency. Currencies float up and down based upon the supply of and demand for each currency. Sometimes a government steps in and devalues its currency relative to the currencies of other countries.</p>

<p id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm303605952">One might argue that the best way to protect workers and the domestic economy is to stop trade with other nations. Then the whole circular flow of inputs and outputs would stay within our borders. But if we decided to do that, how would we get resources like cobalt and coffee beans? The United States simply can’t produce some things, and it can’t manufacture some products, such as steel and most clothing, at the low costs we’re used to. The fact is that nations—like people—are good at producing different things: you may be better at balancing a ledger than repairing a car. In that case you benefit by “exporting” your bookkeeping services and “importing” the car repairs you need from a good mechanic. Economists refer to specialization like this as <em data-effect="italics">advantage.</em></p>

<p id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm325385520">A country has an <span data-type="term">absolute advantage</span> when it can produce and sell a product at a lower cost than any other country or when it is the only country that can provide a product. The United States, for example, has an absolute advantage in reusable spacecraft and other high-tech items.</p>
<p id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm323293472">Suppose that the United States has an absolute advantage in air traffic control systems for busy airports and that Brazil has an absolute advantage in coffee. The United States does not have the proper climate for growing coffee, and Brazil lacks the technology to develop air traffic control systems. Both countries would gain by exchanging air traffic control systems for coffee.</p>

<p id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm352095104">Even if the United States had an absolute advantage in both coffee and air traffic control systems, it should still specialize and engage in trade. Why? The reason is the <span data-type="term">principle of comparative advantage</span>, which says that each country should specialize in the products that it can produce most readily and cheaply and trade those products for goods that foreign countries can produce most readily and cheaply. This specialization ensures greater product availability and lower prices.</p>
<p id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm321534752">For example, India and Vietnam have a comparative advantage in producing clothing because of lower labor costs. Japan has long held a comparative advantage in consumer electronics because of technological expertise. The United States has an advantage in computer software, airplanes, some agricultural products, heavy machinery, and jet engines.</p>
<p id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm339600816">Thus, comparative advantage acts as a stimulus to trade. When nations allow their citizens to trade whatever goods and services they choose without government regulation, free trade exists. <span data-type="term">Free trade</span> is the policy of permitting the people and businesses of a country to buy and sell where they please without restrictions. The opposite of free trade is <span data-type="term">protectionism</span>, in which a nation protects its home industries from outside competition by establishing artificial barriers such as tariffs and quotas. In the next section, we’ll look at the various barriers, some natural and some created by governments, that restrict free trade.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm336225280"><h3 data-type="title">The Fear of Trade and Globalization</h3><p id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm344125520">The continued protests during meetings of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">World Trade Organization</span> and the protests during the convocations of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">World Bank</span> and the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">International Monetary Fund</span> (the three organizations are discussed later in the chapter) show that many people fear world trade and globalization. What do they fear? The negatives of global trade are as follows:</p>
<ul id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm501130976">
<li>Millions of Americans have lost jobs due to imports or production shifting abroad. Most find new jobs, but often those jobs pay less.</li>
<li>Millions of others fear losing their jobs, especially at those companies operating under competitive pressure.</li>
<li>Employers often threaten to export jobs if workers do not accept pay cuts.</li>
<li>Service and white-collar jobs are increasingly vulnerable to operations moving offshore.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm342359056">Sending domestic jobs to another country is called <span data-type="term">outsourcing</span>, a topic you can explore in more depth. Many U.S. companies, such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Dell</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">IBM</span>, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">AT&amp;T</span>, have set up call service centers in India, the Philippines, and other countries. Now even engineering and research and development jobs are being outsourced. Outsourcing and “American jobs” were a big part of the 2016 presidential election with <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Carrier</span>’s plan to close a plant in Indianapolis and open a new plant in Mexico. While intervention by President <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Trump</span> did lead to 800 jobs remaining in Indianapolis, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Carrier</span> later informed the state of Indiana that it would cut 632 workers from its Indianapolis factory. The manufacturing jobs will move to Monterrey, Mexico, where the minimum wage is $3.90 per day.<a href="#auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_rfin-ch03_15" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_rfin-ch03_15">Danielle Paquette, “Trump Said He Would Save Jobs at Carrier.

However, some economists say it leads to cheaper goods and services for U.S. consumers because costs are lower. Also, it should stimulate exports to fast-growing countries. No one knows how many jobs will be lost to outsourcing in coming years. According to estimates, almost 2.4 million U.S. jobs were outsourced in 2015.<a href="#auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_rfin-ch03_16" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_rfin-ch03_16">“Jobs Overseas Statistics,” http://www.statisticbrain.com, accessed June 26, 2017.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm366052528">A closer look reveals that globalization has been the engine that creates jobs and wealth. Benefits of global trade include the following:</p>
<ul id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm321142864">
<li>Productivity grows more quickly when countries produce goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage. Living standards can increase faster. One problem is that big <span data-type="term">G20</span> countries have added more than 1,200 restrictive export and import measures since 2008.</li>
<li>Global competition and cheap imports keep prices down, so inflation is less likely to stop economic growth. However, in some cases this is not working because countries manipulate their currency to get a price advantage.</li>
<li>An open economy spurs innovation with fresh ideas from abroad.</li>
<li>Through infusion of foreign capital and technology, global trade provides poor countries with the chance to develop economically by spreading prosperity.</li>
<li>More information is shared between two trading partners that may not have much in common initially, including insight into local cultures and customs, which may help the two nations expand their collective knowledge and learn ways to compete globally.<a href="#auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_rfin-ch03_17" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_rfin-ch03_17">Mike Collins, “The Pros and Cons of Globalization,” <em data-effect="italics">Forbes,</em> https://www.forbes.com, May 6, 2015.</div></a></li>

</ol>
<p id="auto_c17254a1-30a2-448d-aad8-0c68436a3653_fs-idm365886368">Nations trade because they gain by doing so. The principle of comparative advantage states that each country should specialize in the goods it can produce most readily and cheaply and trade them for those that other countries can produce most readily and cheaply. The result is more goods at lower prices than if each country produced by itself everything it needed. Free trade allows trade among nations without government restrictions.</p>

<li>What are the barriers to international trade?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm334573488">International trade is carried out by both businesses and governments—as long as no one puts up trade barriers. In general, trade barriers keep firms from selling to one another in foreign markets. The major obstacles to international trade are natural barriers, tariff barriers, and nontariff barriers.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm355442256"><h3 data-type="title">Natural Barriers</h3>
<p id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm363281600">Natural barriers to trade can be either physical or cultural. For instance, even though raising beef in the relative warmth of Argentina may cost less than raising beef in the bitter cold of Siberia, the cost of shipping the beef from South America to Siberia might drive the price too high. <em data-effect="italics">Distance</em> is thus one of the natural barriers to international trade.</p>
<p id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm351567008">Language is another natural trade barrier. People who can’t communicate effectively may not be able to negotiate trade agreements or may ship the wrong goods.</p>

<p id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm339010240">A <span data-type="term">tariff</span> is a tax imposed by a nation on imported goods. It may be a charge per unit, such as per barrel of oil or per new car; it may be a percentage of the value of the goods, such as 5 percent of a $500,000 shipment of shoes; or it may be a combination. No matter how it is assessed, any tariff makes imported goods more costly, so they are less able to compete with domestic products.</p>
<p id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm365587552"><span data-type="term">Protective tariffs</span> make imported products less attractive to buyers than domestic products. The United States, for instance, has protective tariffs on imported poultry, textiles, sugar, and some types of steel and clothing, and in March of 2018 the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Trump</span> administration added tariffs on steel and aluminum from most countries. On the other side of the world, Japan imposes a tariff on U.S. cigarettes that makes them cost 60 percent more than Japanese brands. U.S. tobacco firms believe they could get as much as a third of the Japanese market if there were no tariffs on cigarettes. With tariffs, they have under 2 percent of the market.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm313218592"><h4 data-type="title">Arguments for and against Tariffs</h4>
<p id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm365879680">Congress has debated the issue of tariffs since 1789. The main arguments <em data-effect="italics">for</em> tariffs include the following:</p>
<ul id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm361889872">
<li>Tariffs protect infant industries. A tariff can give a struggling new domestic industry time to become an effective global competitor.</li>
<li>Tariffs protect U.S. jobs. Unions and others say tariffs keep foreign labor from taking away U.S. jobs.</li>
<li>Tariffs aid in military preparedness. Tariffs should protect industries and technology during peacetime that are vital to the military in the event of war.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm352806656">The main arguments <em data-effect="italics">against</em> tariffs include the following:</p>
<ul id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm363248992">
<li>Tariffs discourage free trade, and free trade lets the principle of competitive advantage work most efficiently.</li>
<li>Tariffs raise prices, thereby decreasing consumers’ purchasing power. In 2017, the United States imposed tariffs of 63.86 percent to 190.71 percent on a wide variety of Chinese steel products. The idea was to give U.S. steel manufacturers a fair market after the Department of Commerce concluded their antidumping and anti-subsidy probes. It is still too early to determine what the effects of these tariffs will be, but higher steel prices are likely. Heavy users of steel, such as construction and automobile industries, will see big increases in their production costs. It is also likely that China may impose tariffs on certain U.S. products and services and that any negotiations on intellectual property and piracy will bog down.<a href="#auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_rfin-ch03_18" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_rfin-ch03_18">Wendy Wu, “China Upset at High U.S. Tariffs on Steel Imports,” <em data-effect="italics">South China Morning Post,</em> http://www.scmp.com, February 4, 2017.</div></a></li>

<p id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm362116928">Governments also use other tools besides tariffs to restrict trade. One type of nontariff barrier is the <span data-type="term">import quota</span>, or limits on the quantity of a certain good that can be imported. The goal of setting quotas is to limit imports to the specific amount of a given product. The United States protects its shrinking textile industry with quotas. A complete list of the commodities and products subject to import quotas is available on line at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency website.<a href="#auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_rfin-ch03_19" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_rfin-ch03_19">“Commodities Subject to Import Quotas,” https://www.cbp.gov, accessed June 25, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm351127520">A complete ban against importing or exporting a product is an <span data-type="term">embargo</span>. Often embargoes are set up for defense purposes. For instance, the United States does not allow various high-tech products, such as supercomputers and lasers, to be exported to countries that are not allies. Although this embargo costs U.S. firms billions of dollars each year in lost sales, it keeps enemies from using the latest technology in their military hardware.</p>
<p id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm342430304">Government rules that give special privileges to domestic manufacturers and retailers are called <span data-type="term">buy-national regulations</span>. One such regulation in the United States bans the use of foreign steel in constructing U.S. highways. Many state governments have buy-national rules for supplies and services. In a more subtle move, a country may make it hard for foreign products to enter its markets by establishing customs regulations that are different from generally accepted international standards, such as requiring bottles to be quart size rather than liter size.</p>
<p id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm338752592"><span data-type="term">Exchange controls</span> are laws that require a company earning foreign exchange (foreign currency) from its exports to sell the foreign exchange to a control agency, usually a central bank. For example, assume that Rolex, a Swiss company, sells 300 watches to Zales Jewelers, a U.S. chain, for US$600,000. If Switzerland had exchange controls, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Rolex</span> would have to sell its U.S. dollars to the Swiss central bank and would receive Swiss francs. If <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Rolex</span> wants to buy goods (supplies to make watches) from abroad, it must go to the central bank and buy foreign exchange (currency). By controlling the amount of foreign exchange sold to companies, the government controls the amount of products that can be imported. Limiting imports and encouraging exports helps a government to create a favorable balance of trade.</p>

<li>What are the barriers to international trade?</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_6a744098-b8d7-4c4a-b8c9-c451f2ccf9e8_fs-idm344535856">The three major barriers to international trade are natural barriers, such as distance and language; tariff barriers, or taxes on imported goods; and nontariff barriers. The nontariff barriers to trade include import quotas, embargoes, buy-national regulations, and exchange controls. The main argument against tariffs is that they discourage free trade and keep the principle of comparative advantage from working efficiently. The main argument for using tariffs is that they help protect domestic companies, industries, and workers.</p>

<p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm321726112">U.S. firms don’t always get to compete on an equal basis with foreign firms in international trade. To level the playing field, Congress has passed antidumping laws. <span data-type="term">Dumping</span> is the practice of charging a lower price for a product (perhaps below cost) in foreign markets than in the firm’s home market. The company might be trying to win foreign customers, or it might be seeking to get rid of surplus goods.</p>
<p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm347315120">When the variation in price can’t be explained by differences in the cost of serving the two markets, dumping is suspected. Most industrialized countries have antidumping regulations. They are especially concerned about <em data-effect="italics">predatory dumping,</em> the attempt to gain control of a foreign market by destroying competitors with impossibly low prices.</p>
<p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm350781232">The United States recently imposed tariffs on softwood lumber from Canada. Canada was found guilty of pricing softwood lumber at between 7.72 and 4.49 percent below their costs. U.S. customs officers will now levy tariffs on Canadian timber exports with tax rates from 17.41 percent to 30.88 percent, depending on the business.<a href="#auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_rfin-ch03_20" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_rfin-ch03_20">“Members and Observers,” https://www.wto.org, accessed June 25, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm336295504">From our discussion so far, it might seem that governments act only to restrain global trade. On the contrary, governments and international financial organizations work hard to increase it, as this section explains.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm337549456"><h3 data-type="title">Trade Negotiations and the World Trade Organization</h3><p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm487833952">The <span data-type="term">Uruguay Round</span> of trade negotiations is an agreement that dramatically lowers trade barriers worldwide. Adopted in 1994, the agreement has been now signed by 148 nations. The most ambitious global trade agreement ever negotiated, the Uruguay Round reduced tariffs by one-third worldwide, a move that is expected to increase global income by $235 billion annually. Perhaps the most notable aspect of the agreement is its recognition of new global realities. For the first time, an agreement covers services, intellectual property rights, and trade-related investment measures such as exchange controls.</p>
<p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm339381152">As a follow-up to the Uruguay Round, a negotiating round started in the capital of Qatar in 2001 is called the Doha Round. To date, the round has shown little progress in advancing free trade. Developing nations are pushing for the reduction of farm subsidies in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Poor countries say that the subsidies stimulate overproduction, which drives down global agricultural prices. Because developing nations’ primary exports are agricultural commodities, low prices mean that they cannot compete in the global marketplace. On the other hand, the United States and Europe are interested in bringing down trade barriers in services and manufacturing. The continuing talks have served as a lightning rod for protesters, who claim that the World Trade Organization (WTO) serves the interests of multinational corporations, promotes trade over preserving the environment, and treats poor nations unfairly.<a href="#auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_rfin-ch03_21" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_rfin-ch03_21">https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dda_e/dda_e.htm, accessed June 25, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm322205888">The <span data-type="term">World Trade Organization</span> replaces the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was created in 1948. The GATT contained extensive loopholes that enabled countries to evade agreements to reduce trade barriers. Today, all WTO members must fully comply with all agreements under the Uruguay Round. The WTO also has an effective dispute settlement procedure with strict time limits to resolve disputes.</p>
<p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm340110416">The WTO has emerged as the world’s most powerful institution for reducing trade barriers and opening markets. The advantage of WTO membership is that member countries lower trade barriers among themselves. Countries that don’t belong must negotiate trade agreements individually with all their trading partners. Only a few countries, such as North Korea, Turkmenistan, and Eritrea, are not members of the WTO.<a href="#auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_rfin-ch03_22" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_rfin-ch03_22">“WTO Technical Notes,” https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/anrep_e/wtr10_tech_notes_e.pdf, accessed July 17, 2017.</div></a></p>

</figure><p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm345755360">The United States has had mixed results in bringing disputes before the WTO. To date, it has won slightly fewer than half of the cases it has presented to the WTO. America has also won about one-third of the cases brought against it by other countries. One of America’s recent losses came in a ruling where the U.S. claimed that tuna imported from Mexico was not meeting the “dolphin safe” criteria, meaning that dolphins were not being killed during the process to catching tuna. The WTO ruled in favor of Mexico. Recently, the United States targeted Europe, India, South Korea, Canada, and Argentina to file cases against. The disputes ranged from European aviation practices to Indian trade barriers affecting U.S. automakers.</p>
<p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm321837840">One of the biggest disputes before the WTO involved the United States and the European Union.

The European Union claims that the U.S. government has provided $23 billion in military research that has benefited <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Boeing</span>’s commercial aircraft business. It also claimed that Washington State (the home of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Boeing</span> manufacturing) has given the company $3.2 billion in unfair tax breaks.<a href="#auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_rfin-ch03_23" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_rfin-ch03_23">“EC and Certain Member States—Large Civil Aircraft,” https://www.wto.org, accessed June 25, 2017.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm483759920">Two international financial organizations are instrumental in fostering global trade. The <span data-type="term">World Bank</span> offers low-interest loans to developing nations. Originally, the purpose of the loans was to help these nations build infrastructure such as roads, power plants, schools, drainage projects, and hospitals. Now the World Bank offers loans to help developing nations relieve their debt burdens. To receive the loans, countries must pledge to lower trade barriers and aid private enterprise. In addition to making loans, the World Bank is a major source of advice and information for developing nations. The United States has granted the organization millions to create knowledge databases on nutrition, birth control, software engineering, creating quality products, and basic accounting systems.</p>
<p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm339056912">The <span data-type="term">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</span> was founded in 1945, one year after the creation of the World Bank, to promote trade through financial cooperation and eliminate trade barriers in the process. The IMF makes short-term loans to member nations that are unable to meet their budgetary expenses. It operates as a lender of last resort for troubled nations. In exchange for these emergency loans, IMF lenders frequently extract significant commitments from the borrowing nations to address the problems that led to the crises. These steps may include curtailing imports or even devaluing the currency.</p>
<p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm353895712">Some global financial problems do not have a simple solution. One option would be to pump a lot more funds into the IMF, giving it enough resources to bail out troubled countries and put them back on their feet. In effect, the IMF would be turned into a real lender of last resort for the world economy.</p>
<p id="auto_40412cc1-8394-4036-9f12-489acadef168_fs-idm340776144">The danger of counting on the IMF, though, is the “moral hazard” problem. Investors would assume that the IMF would bail them out and would therefore be encouraged to take bigger and bigger risks in emerging markets, leading to the possibility of even deeper financial crises in the future.</p>

<p id="auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_fs-idm335745040">Nations that frequently trade with each other may decide to formalize their relationship. The governments meet and work out agreements for a common economic policy. The result is an economic community or, in other cases, a bilateral trade agreement (an agreement between two countries to lower trade barriers). For example, two nations may agree upon a <span data-type="term">preferential tariff</span>, which gives advantages to one nation (or several nations) over others. When members of the British Commonwealth (countries that are former British territories) trade with Great Britain, they pay lower tariffs than do other nations. For example, Canada and Australia are former British territories but still members of the British Commonwealth. You will note that Queen Elizabeth still appears on Canadian currency and the Union Jack is still incorporated into the Australian flag. In other cases, nations may form free-trade associations. In a <span data-type="term">free-trade zone</span>, few duties or rules restrict trade among the partners, but nations outside the zone must pay the tariffs set by the individual members.</p>

The agreement was ratified by the U.S. Congress in 1993. It includes Canada, the United States, and Mexico, with a combined population of 450 million and an economy of over $20.8 trillion.<a href="#auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_rfin-ch03_24" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_rfin-ch03_24">“Facts about NAFTA: Statistics and Accomplishments,” https://www.thebalance.com/facts-about-nafta-statistics-and-accomplishments-3306280, July 7, 2017.</div></a>
NAFTA has since been modified by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The USMCA was largely accepted and entered into force on July 1, 2020.</p>
<p id="auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_fs-idm353895712">Canada, one of the largest U.S. trading partners, entered a free-trade agreement with the United States in 1988. Thus, most of the new long-run opportunities opened for U.S. business under NAFTA are in Mexico, America’s third-largest trading partner. Before NAFTA, tariffs on Mexican exports to the United States averaged just 4 percent, and most goods entered the United States duty-free, so NAFTA’s primary impact was to open the Mexican market to U.S. companies. When the treaty went into effect, tariffs on about half the items traded across the Rio Grande disappeared. Since NAFTA came into effect, U.S.-Mexican trade has increased from $80 billion to $515 billion annually. The pact removed a web of Mexican licensing requirements, quotas, and tariffs that limited transactions in U.S. goods and services. For instance, the pact allows U.S. and Canadian financial-services companies to own subsidiaries in Mexico for the first time in 50 years.</p>

The dispute is the result of disagreements about Canadian lumber production and imports between the two nations. The main contention in the softwood lumber dispute is the U.S. claim that the Canadian government is unfairly subsidizing Canadian lumber production by providing access to public land while U.S. producers harvest softwood lumber on their own property. <em data-effect="italics">Why do anti-free-trade groups support these tariffs when the result will be higher prices for softwood lumber?</em> (Credit: Jesse Wagstaff/ Flickr/ Attribution-NoDerivs 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0))</figcaption>

</figure><p id="auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_fs-idm333592736">The real test of NAFTA and now USMCA will be whether it can deliver rising prosperity on both sides of the Rio Grande. For Mexicans, NAFTA must provide rising wages, better benefits, and an expanding middle class with enough purchasing power to keep buying goods from the United States and Canada. That scenario seems to be working. At the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Delphi</span> Corp. auto parts plant in Ciudad Juárez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas, the assembly line is a cross section of working-class Mexico. In the years since NAFTA lowered trade and investment barriers, Delphi has significantly expanded its presence in the country. Today it employs 70,000 Mexicans, who every day receive up to 70 million U.S.-made components to assemble into parts. The wages are modest by U.S. standards—an assembly-line worker with two years’ experience earns about $2.30 an hour. But that’s triple Mexico’s minimum wage, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Delphi</span> jobs are among the most coveted in Juárez. The United States recently notified the Canadian and Mexican governments that it intends to renegotiate aspects of the NAFTA agreement.<a href="#auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_rfin-ch03_25" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_rfin-ch03_25">“Mexico Nominal Hourly Wages in Manufacturing,” https://tradingeconomics.com, accessed June 25, 2017; Julie Hirschfeld Davis, “Trump Sends NAFTA Renegotiation Notice to Congress,” <em data-effect="italics">The New York Times,</em> http://www.nytimes.com, May 18, 2017; Kate Linthicum, “What Happened When Factory Jobs Moved from Warren, Ohio, to Juarez, Mexico,” <em data-effect="italics">Los Angeles Times,</em> http://www.latimes.com, February 17, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_fs-idm339935936">One of the largest new trade agreement is <span data-type="term">Mercosur</span>, which includes Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. The elimination of most tariffs among the trading partners has resulted in trade revenues that currently exceed $16 billion annually. Recent recessions in Mercosur countries have limited economic growth, even though trade among Mercosur countries has continued to grow. Most recently, the largest new trade is agreement is the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This trade agreement includes fifteen (15) Asian States and signals to investors that the region is still committed to multilateral trade integration. One item that is most notable about this trade agreement is that the U.S. is not a member.</p>

<p id="auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_fs-idm321805184">The newest free trade agreement is the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) passed in 2005. Besides the United States, the agreement includes Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The United States is already the principal exporter to these nations, so economists don’t think that it will result in a major increase in U.S. exports. It will, however, reduce tariffs on exports to CAFTA countries. Already, some 80 percent of the goods imported into the United States from CAFTA nations are tariff-free. CAFTA countries may benefit from the new permanent trade deal if U.S. multinational firms deepen their investment in the region.</p>

</figure><p id="auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_fs-idm350660304">One of the principal objectives of the European Union is to promote economic progress of all member countries. The EU has stimulated economic progress by eliminating trade barriers, differences in tax laws, and differences in product standards, and by establishing a common currency. A new European Community Bank was created, along with a common currency called the euro. The European Union’s single market has created 2.5 million new jobs since it was founded and generated more than $1 trillion in new wealth.<a href="#auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_rfin-ch03_28" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_rfin-ch03_28">“Is Europe Outperforming the US?” <em data-effect="italics">World Economic Forum</em>, https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/10/is-europe-outperforming-the-us/, October 30, 2015.</div></a> The opening of national EU markets has brought down the price of national telephone calls by 50 percent since 1998. Under pressure of competition, the prices of airfares in Europe have fallen significantly. The removal of national restrictions has enabled more than 15 million Europeans to go to another EU country to work or spend their retirement.</p>
<p id="auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_fs-idm350559184">The EU is a very tough antitrust enforcer; some would say it is tougher than the United States.

Another big U.S. company, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Coca-Cola</span>, settled a six-year antitrust dispute with the European Court by agreeing to strict limits on its sales tactics. Coke can’t sign exclusive agreements with retailers that would ban competing soft drinks or give retailers rebates based on sales volume.

For example, European automakers have proposed holding Japanese imports at roughly their current 10 percent market share. The Irish, Danes, and Dutch don’t make cars and have unrestricted home markets; they are unhappy at the prospect of limited imports of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Toyotas</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hondas</span>. Meanwhile, France has a strict quota on Japanese cars to protect its own <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Renault</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Peugeot</span>.

<p id="auto_e5c301bc-67c1-404d-8804-5a802bb62293_fs-idm345763424">The European Union proposed a constitution that would centralize powers at the Union level and decrease the powers of individual member countries. It also would create a single voice in world affairs by creating a post of foreign minister. The constitution also gave the EU control over political asylum, immigration, guaranteed freedom of speech, and collective labor bargaining. In order to become law, each EU country had to ratify the constitution. The two most powerful countries in the EU, France and Germany, voted “no” in the summer of 2005. Citizens of both countries were afraid that the constitution would draw jobs away from Western Europe and to the Eastern European EU countries. These new members of the EU have lower wage rates and fewer regulations. Voters were also worried that the constitution would result in free-market reforms along American or British lines over France and Germany’s traditional social protections. Concerns over immigration also sparked the referendum vote that is leading to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.</p>

<li>How do companies enter the global marketplace?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm313627696">Companies decide to “go global” for a number of reasons. Perhaps the most urgent reason is to earn additional profits. If a firm has a unique product or technological advantage not available to other international competitors, this advantage should result in major business successes abroad. In other situations, management may have exclusive market information about foreign customers, marketplaces, or market situations. In this case, although exclusivity can provide an initial motivation for going global, managers must realize that competitors will eventually catch up. Finally, saturated domestic markets, excess capacity, and potential for cost savings can also be motivators to expand into international markets. A company can enter global trade in several ways, as this section describes.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm340337888"><h3 data-type="title">Exporting</h3>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm353435328">When a company decides to enter the global market, usually the least complicated and least risky alternative is <span data-type="term">exporting</span>, or selling domestically produced products to buyers in another country. A company, for example, can sell directly to foreign importers or buyers. Exporting is not limited to huge corporations such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">General Motors</span> or <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Apple</span>. Indeed, small companies typically enter the global marketplace by exporting. China is the world’s largest exporter, followed by the United States.<a href="#auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_rfin-ch03_31" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_rfin-ch03_31"> https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2078rank.html, accessed June 25, 2017.</div></a> Many small businesses claim that they lack the money, time, or knowledge of foreign markets that exporting requires. The U.S. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Small Business Administration</span> (SBA) now offers the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Export Working Capital Program</span>, which helps small and medium-size firms obtain working capital (money) to complete export sales. The SBA also provides counseling and legal assistance for small businesses that wish to enter the global marketplace. Companies such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">American Building Restoration Products</span> of Franklin, Wisconsin, have benefited tremendously from becoming exporters. American Building is now selling its chemical products to building restoration companies in Mexico, Israel, Japan, and Korea. Exports account for more than 5 percent of the firm’s total sales.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm321403104">Plenty of governmental help is available when a company decides to begin exporting. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Export Assistance Centers</span> (EAC) provide a one-stop resource for help in exporting. Over 700 EACs are placed strategically around the country. Often the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">SBA</span> is located in the same building as the EAC. The SBA can guarantee loans of $50,000 to $100,000 to help an exporter grow its business. Online help is also available at http://www.ustr.gov. The site lists international trade events, offers international marketing research, and has practical tools to help with every step of the exporting process. Companies considering exporting for the first time can go to http://www.export.gov and get answers to questions such as: What’s in it for me? Am I ready for this? What do I have to do? The site also provides a huge list of resources for the first-time exporter.</p>

<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm313630896">Another effective way for a firm to move into the global arena with relatively little risk is to sell a license to manufacture its product to a firm in a foreign country. <span data-type="term">Licensing</span> is the legal process whereby a firm (the <em data-effect="italics">licensor</em>) agrees to let another firm (the <em data-effect="italics">licensee</em>) use a manufacturing process, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other proprietary knowledge. The licensee, in turn, agrees to pay the licensor a royalty or fee agreed on by both parties.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm335805872">International licensing is a multibillion-dollar-a-year industry. Entertainment and character licensing, such as DVD movies and characters such as Batman, is the largest single category. Trademarks are the second-largest source of licensing revenue. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Caterpillar</span> licenses its brand for both shoes and clothing, which is very popular in Europe.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm349934848">U.S. companies have eagerly embraced the licensing concept. For instance, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Labatt Brewing Company</span> has a license to produce Miller High Life in Canada. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Spalding Company</span> receives more than $2 million annually from license agreements on its sporting goods. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Fruit of the Loom</span> lends its name through licensing to 45 consumer items in Japan alone, for at least 1 percent of the licensee’s gross sales.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm321749376">The licensor must make sure it can exercise sufficient control over the licensee’s activities to ensure proper quality, pricing, distribution, and so on. Licensing may also create a new competitor in the long run if the licensee decides to void the license agreement. International law is often ineffective in stopping such actions. Two common ways that a licensor can maintain effective control over its licensees are by shipping one or more critical components from the United States and by locally registering patents and trademarks in its own name.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm321994272"><em data-effect="italics">Franchising</em> is a form of licensing that has grown rapidly in recent years. Many U.S. franchisors operate thousands of outlets in foreign countries. More than half of the international franchises are for fast-food restaurants and business services. McDonald’s, however, decided to sell its Chinese stores to a group of outside investors for $1.8 billion, but retained 20 percent of the equity.<a href="#auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_rfin-ch03_32" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_rfin-ch03_32"> “McDonald’s Sells Control of China Business to Citic, Carlyle,” <em data-effect="italics">Bloomberg News</em>, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-09/mcdonald-s-sells-control-of-china-business-to-citic-carlyle, January 9, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm335219968">Having a big-name franchise doesn’t always guarantee success or mean that the job will be easy. In China, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Home Depot</span> closed its stores after opening 12 to serve the large Chinese population. Had they done market research, they would have known that the majority of urban dwellers live in recently built apartments and that DIY (Do It Yourself) is viewed with disdain in Chinese society, where it is seen as a sign of poverty.<a href="#auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_rfin-ch03_33" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_rfin-ch03_33">“Famous Failures in China,” http://www.1421.consulting, February 2, 2016.</div></a> When <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Subway</span> opened its first sandwich shop in China, locals stood outside and watched for a few days. Patrons were so confused that the franchisee had to print signs explaining how to order. Customers didn’t believe the tuna salad was made from a fish because they couldn’t see the head or tail. And they didn’t like the idea of touching their food, so they would hold the sandwich vertically, peel off the paper wrap, and eat it like a banana. Most of all, the Chinese customers didn’t want sandwiches.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm335960048">It’s not unusual for Western food chains to adapt their strategies when selling in China. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">McDonald’s</span>, aware that the Chinese consume more chicken than beef, offered a spicy chicken burger. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">KFC</span> got rid of coleslaw in favor of seasonal dishes such as shredded carrots or bamboo shoots.</p>

<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm350386816">In <span data-type="term">contract manufacturing</span>, a foreign firm manufactures private-label goods under a domestic firm’s brand. Marketing may be handled by either the domestic company or the foreign manufacturer. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Levi Strauss</span>, for instance, entered into an agreement with the French fashion house of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Cacharel</span> to produce a new Levi’s line, Something New, for distribution in Germany.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm351066096">The advantage of contract manufacturing is that it lets a company test the water in a foreign country. By allowing the foreign firm to produce a certain volume of products to specification and put the domestic firm’s brand name on the goods, the domestic firm can broaden its global marketing base without investing in overseas plants and equipment. After establishing a solid base, the domestic firm may switch to a joint venture or direct investment, explained below.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm321667712"><h3 data-type="title">Joint Ventures</h3>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm336898320">Joint ventures are somewhat similar to licensing agreements. In a <span data-type="term">joint venture</span>, the domestic firm buys part of a foreign company or joins with a foreign company to create a new entity. A joint venture is a quick and relatively inexpensive way to enter the global market. It can also be very risky. Many joint ventures fail. Others fall victim to a takeover, in which one partner buys out the other.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm340724144">Sometimes countries have required local partners in order to establish a business in their country. China, for example, had this requirement in a number of industries until recently. Thus, a joint venture was the only way to enter the market. Joint ventures help reduce risks by sharing costs and technology. Often joint ventures will bring together different strengths from each member. In the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">General Motors</span>-<span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Suzuki</span> joint venture in Canada, for example, both parties have contributed and gained. The alliance, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">CAMI Automotive</span>, was formed to manufacture low-end cars for the U.S. market. The plant, which was run by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Suzuki</span> management, produces the Chevrolet Equinox and the Pontiac Torrent, as well as the new Suzuki SUV. Through CAMI, Suzuki has gained access to GM’s dealer network and an expanded market for parts and components. GM avoided the cost of developing low-end cars and obtained models it needed to revitalize the lower end of its product line and its average fuel economy rating. After the successful joint venture, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">General Motors</span> gained full control of the operation in 2011. The CAMI factory may be one of the most productive plants in North America. There GM has learned how Japanese automakers use work teams, run flexible assembly lines, and manage quality control.<a href="#auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_rfin-ch03_34" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_rfin-ch03_34"> General Motors website, http://www.gmcamiassembly.ca/Facilities/public/ca/en/CAMI/about_us.html, accessed July 17, 2017.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm353853184">Active ownership of a foreign company or of overseas manufacturing or marketing facilities is <span data-type="term">direct foreign investment</span>. Direct investors have either a controlling interest or a large minority interest in the firm. Thus, they stand to receive the greatest potential reward but also face the greatest potential risk. A firm may make a direct foreign investment by acquiring an interest in an existing company or by building new facilities. It might do so because it has trouble transferring some resources to a foreign operation or obtaining that resource locally. One important resource is personnel, especially managers. If the local labor market is tight, the firm may buy an entire foreign firm and retain all its employees instead of paying higher salaries than competitors.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm337120544">Sometimes firms make direct investments because they can find no suitable local partners. Also, direct investments avoid the communication problems and conflicts of interest that can arise with joint ventures. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">IBM</span>, in the past, insisted on total ownership of its foreign investments because it did not want to share control with local partners.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm339209968"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">General Motors</span> has done very well by building a $4,400 (RMB 29,800) minivan in China that gets 43 miles per gallon in city driving.

The seats are only a third of the thickness of seats in Western models, but look plush compared to similar Chinese cars. The minivans have made GM the largest automotive seller in China, and have made China a large profit center for GM.<a href="#auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_rfin-ch03_35" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_rfin-ch03_35">Wuling Sunshine, http://media.gm.com/media/cn/en/wuling/vehicles/sunshine/2010.html, accessed June 27, 2017.</div></a></p>

In Germany, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Walmart</span> bought the 21-store <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Wertkauf</span> hypermarket chain and then 74 unprofitable and often decrepit <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Interspar</span> stores. Problems in integrating and upgrading the stores resulted in at least $200 million in losses. Like all other German stores, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Walmart</span> stores were required by law to close at 8 p.m. on weekdays and 4 p.m. on Saturdays, and they could not open at all on Sundays. Costs were astronomical. As a result, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Walmart</span> left the German retail market.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm336535968"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Walmart</span> has turned the corner on its international operations. It is pushing operational authority down to country managers in order to respond better to local cultures. Walmart enforces certain core principles such as everyday low prices, but country managers handle their own buying, logistics, building design, and other operational decisions.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm353260640">Global firms change their strategies as local market conditions evolve. For example, major oil companies like <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Shell Oil</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">ExxonMobil</span> had to react to dramatic changes in the price of oil due to technological advances such as more efficient automobiles, fracking, and horizontal drilling.</p>

<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm334990800">In 2014, crude oil was $90 a barrel, but increased production due to the shale oil boom and the reluctance of OPEC countries to reduce output led to a price drop to $45–$60 throughout the first quarter of 2015. While this is terrific news for consumers, it does provide challenges to managers at both large and small companies connected to the oil industry. Companies such as Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, and ExxonMobil saw dramatic reductions in their earnings, which were also reflected in lower stock prices.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm353524480">The action taken by senior executives at Chevron was to trim their planned capital expenditures by $5 billion in 2016, resulting in the elimination of 1,500 jobs, while ExxonMobil executives Jeff Woodbury and CEO Rex Tillerson (now the former U.S. Secretary of State) were less specific; they planned several belt-tightening strategies and forecast several years of low oil prices. Likewise, Ben van Beurden, the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, announced plans to eliminate 6,500 jobs and also predicted long-range low prices for oil.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm351148160">In addition to layoffs, actions that oil company managers can employ include mergers for companies that don’t have the ability to become fully efficient themselves. They can merge with other companies that can improve overall efficiencies and operations. Contrary to the cost-cutting plans mentioned earlier, some companies might consider increasing their spending plans. Going against the reduced expenditures trend is Encana, a North American oil producer, which plans to increase its overall spending. Some of the factors that allowed Encana to increase spending was its low debt-to-equity ratio and its growth, which exceeded the industry average.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm337216832">Growth is an important component of a company’s strategy, and reactive short-term strategies can often hurt long-term growth. By implementing performance-improvement programs, companies can address problems and inefficiencies within the company and allow them to focus on innovation. Another strategy that companies can use is to review and alter their supply chain by focusing on costs and efficiency. Companies can expand their supplier base, thus increasing competition and reducing costs. This also requires companies to embrace a lean manufacturing mindset.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm331982736">New technology can also be used as a cost driver. New technologies such as microseismic sensors used to monitor fracking operations in drilling operations miles under the earth can boost production. Adopting new technology can also lead to changes in the workers that companies employ. New technology usually requires higher-skilled workers, while reducing the number of lower-skilled workers.</p>
<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_imp-idm272282048">The drop in oil prices has produced a survival-of-the-fittest competition among energy companies. The companies that employ multiple strategies to improve efficiency are the ones that will survive and prosper.</p>

<p id="auto_69cf5895-856d-43c7-b783-b0d21524e7f2_fs-idm340386848">International trade does not always involve cash. Today, countertrade is a fast-growing way to conduct international business. In <span data-type="term">countertrade</span>, part or all of the payment for goods or services is in the form of other goods or services. Countertrade is a form of barter (swapping goods for goods), an age-old practice whose origins have been traced back to cave dwellers. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">U.S. Commerce Department</span> says that roughly 30 percent of all international trade involves countertrade. Each year, about 300,000 U.S. firms engage in some form of countertrade. U.S. companies, including <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">General Electric</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Pepsi</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">General Motors</span>, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Boeing</span>, barter billions of goods and services every year. Recently, the Malaysian government bought 20 diesel-powered locomotives from China and paid for them with palm oil.</p>

<li>What threats and opportunities exist in the global marketplace?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_5e3438dd-e871-4729-ab7c-41a8e262effd_fs-idm327922208">To be successful in a foreign market, companies must fully understand the foreign environment in which they plan to operate. Politics, cultural differences, and the economic environment can represent both opportunities and pitfalls in the global marketplace.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_5e3438dd-e871-4729-ab7c-41a8e262effd_fs-idm321770688"><h3 data-type="title">Political Considerations</h3>
<p id="auto_5e3438dd-e871-4729-ab7c-41a8e262effd_fs-idm350772208">We have already discussed how tariffs, exchange controls, and other governmental actions threaten foreign producers. The political structure of a country may also jeopardize a foreign producer’s success in international trade.</p>
<p id="auto_5e3438dd-e871-4729-ab7c-41a8e262effd_fs-idm340968384">Intense nationalism, for example, can lead to difficulties. <span data-type="term">Nationalism</span> is the sense of national consciousness that boosts the culture and interests of one country over those of all other countries. Strongly nationalistic countries, such as Iran and New Guinea, often discourage investment by foreign companies. In other, less radical forms of nationalism, the government may take actions to hinder foreign operations. France, for example, requires pop music stations to play at least 40 percent of their songs in French. This law was enacted because the French love American rock and roll. Without airtime, American music sales suffer. In another example of nationalism, U.S.-based <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">PPG</span> made an unsolicited bid to acquire Netherlands-based <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">AzkoNobel NV</span>. There was a chorus of opposition from Dutch politicians to the idea of a foreign takeover of AzkoNobel, the Dutch paint manufacturer. The government warned that it would move to defend AzkoNobel from a hostile takeover attempt. AzkoNobel played up the sentiment, tweeting about its rejection of the hostile takeover with the hashtag #DutchPride.<a href="#auto_5e3438dd-e871-4729-ab7c-41a8e262effd_rfin-ch03_37" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_5e3438dd-e871-4729-ab7c-41a8e262effd_rfin-ch03_37">Ellen Proper, “Dutch See Red Over Foreign Bid For Paint Giant,” <em data-effect="italics">Bloomberg News,</em> https://www.bloomberg.com, March 10, 2017.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_5e3438dd-e871-4729-ab7c-41a8e262effd_fs-idm327861040">In a hostile climate, a government may <em data-effect="italics">expropriate</em> a foreign company’s assets, taking ownership and compensating the former owners. Even worse is <em data-effect="italics">confiscation,</em> when the owner receives no compensation. This happened during rebellions in several African nations during the 1990s and 2000s.</p>

Culture underlies the family, educational system, religion, and social class system. The network of social organizations generates overlapping roles and status positions. These values and roles have a tremendous effect on people’s preferences and thus on marketers’ options. For example, in China <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Walmart</span> holds live fishing contests on the premises, and in South Korea the company hosts a food competition with variations on a popular Korean dish, kimchee.</p>
<p id="auto_5e3438dd-e871-4729-ab7c-41a8e262effd_fs-idm339709472">Language is another important aspect of culture. Marketers must take care in selecting product names and translating slogans and promotional messages so as not to convey the wrong meaning. For example, Mitsubishi Motors had to rename its Pajero model in Spanish-speaking countries because the term refers to a sexual activity. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Toyota</span> Motor’s MR2 model dropped the <em data-effect="italics">2</em> in France because the combination sounds like a French swear word. The literal translation of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Coca-Cola</span> in Chinese characters means “bite the wax tadpole.”</p>
<p id="auto_5e3438dd-e871-4729-ab7c-41a8e262effd_fs-idm354081360">Each country has its own customs and traditions that determine business practices and influence negotiations with foreign customers. For example, attempting to do business in Western Europe during the first two weeks in August is virtually impossible. Businesses close, and everyone goes on vacation at the same time. In many countries, personal relationships are more important than financial considerations. For instance, skipping social engagements in Mexico may lead to lost sales. Negotiations in Japan often include long evenings of dining, drinking, and entertaining; only after a close personal relationship has been formed do business negotiations begin. <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_5e3438dd-e871-4729-ab7c-41a8e262effd_fs-idm340149792" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong> presents some cultural dos and don’ts.</p>

<li>Use a “soft-sell” and subtle approach when promoting a product in Japan. Japanese people do not feel comfortable with America’s traditional hard-selling style.</li>
<li>Understand the role of religion in business transactions. In Muslim countries, Ramadan is a holy month when most people fast. During this time everything slows down, particularly business.</li>
<li>Have a local person available to culturally and linguistically interpret any advertising that you plan to do. When American Airlines wanted to promote its new first-class seats in the Mexican market, it translated the “Fly in Leather” campaign literally, which meant “Fly Naked” in Spanish.</li>

In general, complex, sophisticated industries are found in developed countries, and more basic industries are found in less developed nations. Average family incomes are higher in the more developed countries than in the least-developed markets. Larger incomes mean greater purchasing power and demand, not only for consumer goods and services but also for the machinery and workers required to produce consumer goods. <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_5e3438dd-e871-4729-ab7c-41a8e262effd_fs-idm352875984" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong> provides a glimpse of global wealth.</p>

When we think about how our own economy works, we tend to take our infrastructure for granted. It includes the money and banking system that provide the major investment loans to our nation’s businesses; the educational system that turns out the incredible varieties of skills and basic research that actually run our nation’s production lines; the extensive transportation and communications systems—interstate highways, railroads, airports, canals, telephones, internet sites, postal systems, and television stations—that link almost every piece of our geography into one market; the energy system that powers our factories; and, of course, the market system itself, which brings our nation’s goods and services into our homes and businesses.</p>

<p id="auto_5e3438dd-e871-4729-ab7c-41a8e262effd_fs-idm339335904">Domestic firms entering the international arena need to consider the politics, economies, and culture of the countries where they plan to do business. For example, government trade policies can be loose or restrictive, countries can be nationalistic, and governments can change. In the area of culture, many products fail because companies don’t understand the culture of the country where they are trying to sell their products. Some developing countries also lack an economic infrastructure, which often makes it very difficult to conduct business.</p>

</ol>

<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm226807600">Corporations that move resources, goods, services, and skills across national boundaries without regard to the country in which their headquarters are located are <span data-type="term">multinational corporations</span>. Some are so rich and have so many employees that they resemble small countries. For example, the sales of both <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Exxon</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Walmart</span> are larger than the GDP of all but a few nations in the world. Multinational companies are heavily engaged in international trade. The successful ones take political and cultural differences into account.</p>

<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm227823136">Many global brands sell much more outside the United States than at home. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Coca-Cola</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Philip Morris</span>’s Marlboro brand, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Pepsi</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Kellogg</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Pampers</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nescafe</span>, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Gillette</span>, are examples.</p>

<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm213542304">The Fortune 500 made over $1.5 trillion in profit in 2016. In slow-growing, developed economies like Europe and Japan, a weaker dollar helps, because it means cheaper products to sell into those markets, and profits earned in those markets translate into more dollars back home. Meanwhile, emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe are growing steadily. General Electric expects 60 percent of its revenue growth to come from emerging markets over the next decade. For <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Brown-Forman</span>, the spirits company, a fifth of its sales growth of Jack Daniels, the Tennessee whiskey, is coming from developing markets like Mexico and Poland. IBM had rapid sales growth in emerging markets such as Russia, India, and Brazil.<a href="#auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_rfin-ch03_38" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_rfin-ch03_38">Source: “The World’s Largest Corporations,” <em data-effect="italics">Fortune,</em> http://fortune.com/global500/, accessed June 30, 2017.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm230554992">Large multinationals have several advantages over other companies. For instance, multinationals can often overcome trade problems. Taiwan and South Korea have long had an embargo against Japanese cars for political reasons and to help domestic automakers. Yet <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Honda</span> USA, a Japanese-owned company based in the United States, sends Accords to Taiwan and Korea. In another example, when the environmentally conscious Green movement challenged the biotechnology research conducted by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">BASF</span>, a major German chemical and drug manufacturer, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">BASF</span> moved its cancer and immune-system research to Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm213737344">Another advantage for multinationals is their ability to sidestep regulatory problems. U.S. drugmaker <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">SmithKline</span> and Britain’s <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Beecham</span> decided to merge in part so that they could avoid licensing and regulatory hassles in their largest markets. The merged company can say it’s an insider in both Europe and the United States. “When we go to Brussels, we’re a member state [of the European Union],” one executive explains. “And when we go to Washington, we’re an American company.”</p>

<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm231301424">America is the cradle of the consumer goods brand. Here, a free-spending and marketing-saturated public nurtured Apple, Google, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, and countless others to maturity. Many of those brands grew up to conquer other societies, as well.</p>
<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm221942784">But American brands’ domination in the global marketplace is eroding. From Samsung to Toyota to Mercedes Benz to SAP, companies in Europe and Asia are turning out top-quality goods and selling them as such rather than competing on price. “There are longer-term trends toward greater competition. The United States was the only global brand country [but] that’s no longer the case,” says Earl L. Taylor, chief marketing officer of the Marketing Science Institute. “Consumers prefer brands that they take to be of higher quality” regardless of the country of origin, he notes. “Increasingly, there will be other successful global brands in the U.S. [market].”</p>
<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm228027712">Of the brands at the top of Interbrand’s recent list of the world’s most valuable, four of the top five still originate in the United States; the five most valuable are Apple, Google, Coca-Cola, and Microsoft, while Toyota (Japan) comes in at number five. American companies have lost the most ground in the middle tier of recognizable brand names, says George T. Haley, professor of marketing at the University of New Haven’s School of Business.</p>
<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm232442560">One area from which U.S. brands are feeling the pressure is the Asia-Pacific region, which harbors the fastest-growing emerging markets today. In the appliance category, two Chinese companies, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Haier</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Kelon</span>, are becoming top competitors for well-known U.S. brands <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Whirlpool</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Maytag</span>. In fact, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Haier</span> bought GE’s appliance division in 2016. The Chinese branding trend is not confined only to hard goods. Sporting goods and sportswear brand Li Ning, well known within China, is building its international profile. While the Chinese basketball team wore <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nike</span> uniforms at the Athens Olympic Games, the Spanish team wore <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Li Ning</span> apparel. The threat to U.S. brands is not confined to China, however. South Korean brands, such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Samsung</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">LG</span>, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hyundai</span>, have emerged on the global stage in specific categories, such as smartphones, household appliances, and automobiles.</p>
<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm230542704">The animosity that many Europeans feel toward the United States is translated into a preference for European or even Asian brands at the expense of U.S. brands. Plus, experts say, European brands are simply becoming stronger and more consistent.</p>
<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm228552448">Meanwhile, European brands are gaining momentum in the areas of white goods and consumer goods, putting the pressure on such well-known U.S. brands as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bissell</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hoover</span>, experts say. For instance, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Gaggenau</span> is a popular, high-end European kitchen appliance brand, along with <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bosch</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Dyson</span>. Other European brands maintaining cachet—if not always the allure of luxury—include <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Absolut</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Virgin</span>, Mini (as in Cooper), <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Red Bull</span>, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Ikea</span>.</p>

<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm230645296">Multinationals can also tap new technology from around the world. In the United States, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Xerox</span> has introduced some 80 different office copiers that were designed and built by Fuji <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Xerox</span>, its joint venture with a Japanese company. Versions of the super-concentrated detergent that Procter &amp; Gamble first formulated in Japan in response to a rival’s product are now being sold under the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Ariel</span> brand name in Europe and under the Cheer and Tide labels in the United States. Also, consider <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Otis Elevator</span>’s development of the Elevonic 411, an elevator that is programmed to send more cars to floors where demand is high. It was developed by six research centers in five countries. Otis’s group in Farmington, Connecticut, handled the systems integration, a Japanese group designed the special motor drives that make the elevators ride smoothly, a French group perfected the door systems, a German group handled the electronics, and a Spanish group took care of the small-geared components. Otis says the international effort saved more than $10 million in design costs and cut the process from four years to two.</p>
<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm230896928">Finally, multinationals can often save a lot in labor costs, even in highly unionized countries. For example, when <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Xerox</span> started moving copier-rebuilding work to Mexico to take advantage of the lower wages, its union in Rochester, New York, objected because it saw that members’ jobs were at risk. Eventually, the union agreed to change work styles and to improve productivity to keep the jobs at home.</p>

</ol>
<p id="auto_12f930bb-e58c-4d6d-9bcd-4f89e0340d61_fs-idm225839712">Multinational corporations have several advantages. First, they can sidestep restrictive trade and licensing restrictions because they frequently have headquarters in more than one country. Multinationals can also move their operations from one country to the next depending on which location offers more favorable economic conditions. In addition, multinationals can tap into a vast source of technological expertise by drawing upon the knowledge of a global workforce.</p>

<li>What are the trends in the global marketplace?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm488513952">In this section, we will examine several underlying trends that will continue to propel the dramatic growth in world trade. These trends are market expansion, resource acquisition, and the emergence of China and India.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm339919488"><h3 data-type="title">Market Expansion</h3>
<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm336505008">The need for businesses to expand their markets is perhaps the most fundamental reason for the growth in world trade. The limited size of domestic markets often motivates managers to seek markets beyond their national frontiers. The economies of large-scale manufacturing demand big markets. Domestic markets, particularly in smaller countries like Denmark and the Netherlands, simply can’t generate enough demand. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nestlé</span> was one of the first businesses to “go global” because its home country, Switzerland, is so small. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nestlé</span> was shipping milk to 16 different countries as early as 1875. Today, hundreds of thousands of businesses are recognizing the potential rich rewards to be found in international markets.</p>

<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm486987632">More and more companies are going to the global marketplace to acquire the resources they need to operate efficiently. These resources may be cheap or skilled labor, scarce raw materials, technology, or capital. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nike</span>, for example, has manufacturing facilities in many Asian countries in order to use cheaper labor. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Honda</span> opened a design studio in southern California to put that “California flair” into the design of some of its vehicles. Large multinational banks such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bank of New York</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Citigroup</span> have offices in Geneva, Switzerland. Geneva is the private banking center of Europe and attracts capital from around the globe.</p>

<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm350772208">China and India—two of the world’s economic powerhouses—are impacting businesses around the globe, in very different ways. The boom in China’s worldwide exports has left few sectors unscathed, be they garlic growers in California, jeans makers in Mexico, or plastic-mold manufacturers in South Korea. India’s impact has altered how hundreds of service companies from Texas to Ireland compete for billions of dollars in contracts.</p>
<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm321837840">The causes and consequences of each nation’s growth are somewhat different. China’s exports have boomed largely thanks to foreign investment: lured by low labor costs, big manufacturers have surged into China to expand their production base and push down prices globally. Now manufacturers of all sizes, making everything from windshield wipers to washing machines to clothing, are scrambling either to reduce costs at home or to outsource more of what they make in cheaper locales such as China and India.<a href="#auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_rfin-ch03_39" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_rfin-ch03_39">Vijay Govindarajan and Gunjan Bagla, “Understanding the Rise of Manufacturing in India,” <em data-effect="italics">Harvard Business Review,</em> September 18, 2015.</div></a></p>
<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm310246192">Indians are playing invaluable roles in the global innovation chain. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Hewlett-Packard</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Cisco Systems</span>, and other tech giants now rely on their Indian teams to devise software platforms and multimedia features for next-generation devices. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Google</span> principal scientist Krishna Bharat set up the Google Bangalore lab complete with colorful furniture, exercise balls, and a Yamaha organ—like Google’s Mountain View, California, headquarters—to work on core search-engine technology. Indian engineering houses use 3-D computer simulations to tweak designs of everything from car engines and forklifts to aircraft wings for such clients as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">General Motors</span> Corp. and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Boeing</span> Co. Barring unforeseen circumstances, within five years India should vault over Germany as the world’s fourth-biggest economy. By mid-century, China should overtake the United States as number one. By then, China and India could account for half of global output.<a href="#auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_rfin-ch03_40" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_rfin-ch03_40">“As IMF Says, India Should Be One Of World’s Largest Economies, Only Bad Policy Has Prevented It,” <em data-effect="italics">Forbes</em>, https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2017/04/28/as-imf-says-india-should-be-one-of-worlds-largest-economies-only-bad-policy-has-prevented-it/#160c27b05a6b, April 28, 2017.</div></a></p>

<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm353521968">Corporations like <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Albertson’s</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Unilever</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Kimberly Clark</span>, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Siemens</span> are starting to take action on the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">United Nations Sustainability Development Goals</span>. For many years, through corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, corporations have donated money and employee time to address various social and environmental problems, both globally and in their own backyards. The Carnegie Foundation and the Bill and Melinda <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Gates</span> Foundation are examples of this commitment. While these efforts have achieved some progress in environmental protection, ethical business practices, building sustainable positive impacts, and economic development by organizations, they do require deeper and longer engagement. Because the benefits to corporations’ profitability are mostly peripheral, short-term impacts such as a drop in demand often mean that attention is drawn away from CSR programs to attending to immediate bottom-line issues.</p>
<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm350386816">In 2015, the United Nations member-nations adopted 17 resolutions aimed at ending poverty, ensuring sustainability, and ensuring prosperity for all. The aggressive goals were set to be met over the next 15 years.</p>

<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm341197008">Companies like <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Albertson’s</span> recognize that a robust CSR program can enhance a corporation’s reputation, which can indirectly boost the bottom line. They used number 14 on the United Nations Sustainability Development list in concert with <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">World Oceans Day</span> to announce that they as a company pledged to meet the U.N. goals. “We recognize that the wellbeing of people and the sustainability of our oceans are interdependent. As one of the largest U.S. retailers of seafood, we are committed to protecting the world’s oceans so they can remain a bountiful natural resource that contributes to global food security, the livelihoods of hard-working fishermen and the global economy,” said Buster Houston, Director of Seafood at <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Albertson’s</span> Companies. The company is also committed to the concept of fair trade and was the first retailer to sell tuna with the fair trade seal.</p>
<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm340345984">Siemens, the German-based multinational, also supported the adoption of meeting the United Nations Sustainability Development goals, which they believe is based on their company values—responsible, excellent, innovative. They define sustainable development as the means to achieve profitable and long-term growth. In doing so, they align ourselves with the goals of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p>

<li>Why would companies pledge to meet the United Nations Sustainability Development goals when their competitors could ignore them in the name of greater, perhaps short-term, profits?</li>
<li>Are you as a consumer more likely to purchase products from Albertson’s rather than another grocery chain that did not agree to the United Nations sustainability program? If you were working for a company deciding to purchase a large industrial component that was 10% more expensive than a competing product, would Siemens’s affirmation of meeting the United Nations Sustainability Development goals sway your decision? How would you explain the rationale for your decision?</li>

<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm330186656">An accelerating trend is that technical and managerial skills in both China and India are becoming more important than cheap assembly labor. China will stay dominant in mass manufacturing and is one of the few nations building multibillion-dollar electronics and heavy industrial plants. India is a rising power in software, design, services, and precision industry.</p>

<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm354548464">MTV, a division of Viacom International Media Networks and a mainstay of American pop culture, is just as popular in Shanghai as it is in Seattle and Sydney, or in Lagos (Nigeria) as it is in Los Angeles. MTV is a division of Viacom, and their international divisions are called the Viacom International Media Networks. London-based MTV Networks International, the world’s largest global network, has taken its winning formula to 167 foreign markets on six continents, including urban and rural areas. It reaches 4 billion homes in 40 languages through locally programmed and locally operated TV channels and websites. While the United States currently generates about 70 percent of MTV’s profits, 85 percent of the company’s subscriber base lives outside the United States.</p>
<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm350905392">The MTV brand has evolved beyond its music television roots into a multimedia lifestyle, entertainment, and culture brand for all ages. In addition to MTV and MTV2, its channel lineup includes Nickelodeon, VH1, Comedy Central, LOGO, TMF (The Music Factory), Game One, and several European music, comedy, and lifestyle channels, as well as Paramount Channel, Spike, and a growing number of flagship local networks such as Channel 5 in the UK, Telefe in Argentina, and COLORS in India. Adding to the complexity is MTV’s multimedia and interactive nature, with gaming, texting, and websites, as well as television. Another challenge is integrating acquisitions of local companies such as South American Telefe, which it purchased in 2016.</p>
<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm340929696">The company also has an international insights team that gathers the latest consumer insights from around the world. You can get some insight into this initiative at https://insights.viacom.com. The local perspective is invaluable in helping the network understand its markets, whether in terms of musical tastes or what entertainment children like. For example, Alex Okosi, a Nigerian who went to college in the United States, is chief executive for MTV Base, which launched in sub-Saharan Africa in 2005. Okosi recommended that MTV consider each country as an individual market, rather than blending them all together.</p>
<p id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm332424000">One reason for MTVNI’s success is “glocalization”—its ability to adapt programs to fit local cultures while still maintaining a consistent, special style. “When we set a channel up, we always provide a set of parameters in terms of standards of things we require,” an MTV executive explains. “Obviously an MTV channel that doesn’t look good enough is not going to do the business for us, let alone for the audience. There’s a higher expectation.” Then the local unit can tailor content to its market. MTV India conveys a “sense of the colorful street culture,” explains Bill Roedy, former MTV Networks International president, while MTV Japan has “a sense of technology edginess; MTV Italy, style and elegance.” In Africa, MTV Base features videos from top African artists as well as from emerging African music talent. According to company executives, the goal is to “provide a unique cultural meeting point for young people in Africa, using the common language of music to connect music fans from different backgrounds and cultures.”</p><div data-type="list" id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_fs-idm335237488"><div data-type="title" id="auto_147d00d2-8097-4845-bfcc-a266a710040e_3">Critical Thinking Questions</div><ol>

<li>How does the legal system govern business transactions and settle disputes?</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm346765168">Our legal system affects everyone who lives and does business in the United States. The smooth functioning of society depends on the law, which protects the rights of people and businesses. The purpose of law is to keep the system stable while allowing orderly change. The law defines which actions are allowed or banned and regulates some practices. It also helps settle disputes. The legal system both shapes and is shaped by political, economic, and social systems. As Judge Learned Hand wrote in <em data-effect="italics">The Spirit of Liberty,</em> “Without [the law] we cannot live; only with it can we insure the future which by right is ours.”</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm410739760">In any society, <span data-type="term">laws</span> are the rules of conduct created and enforced by a controlling authority, usually the government. They develop over time in response to the changing needs of people, property, and business. The legal system of the United States is thus the result of a long and continuing process. In each generation, new social problems occur, and new laws are created to solve them. For instance, in the late 1800s corporations in certain industries, such as steel and oil, merged and became dominant. The Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in 1890 to control these powerful firms. Eighty years later, in 1970, Congress passed the National Environmental Policy Act. This law dealt with pollution problems, which no one had thought about in 1890. Today new areas of law are developing to deal with the internet and the recent financial scandals.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm403087872"><h4 data-type="title">The Main Sources of Law</h4>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm387301168"><span data-type="term">Common law</span> is the body of unwritten law that has evolved out of judicial (court) decisions rather than being enacted by legislatures. It is also called case law. It developed in England and came to America with the colonists. All states except Louisiana, which follows the Napoleonic Code inherited from French settlers, follow the English system. Common law is based on community customs that were recognized and enforced by the courts.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm387774048"><span data-type="term">Statutory law</span> is written law enacted by legislatures at all levels, from city and state governments to the federal government. Examples of statutory law are the federal and state constitutions, bills passed by Congress, and ordinances, which are laws enacted by local governments. Statutory law is the chief source of new laws in the United States. Among the business activities governed by statutory law are securities regulation, incorporation, sales, bankruptcy, and antitrust.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm349740880">Related to statutory law is <span data-type="term">administrative law</span>, or the rules, regulations, and orders passed by boards, commissions, and agencies of federal, state, and local governments. The scope and influence of administrative law have expanded as the number of these government bodies has grown. Federal agencies issue more rulings and settle more disputes than all the courts and legislatures combined. Some federal agencies that issue rules are the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm351996688"><span data-type="term">Business law</span> is the body of law that governs commercial dealings. These laws provide a protective environment within which businesses can operate. They serve as guidelines for business decisions. Every businessperson should be familiar with the laws governing his or her field. Some laws, such as the Internal Revenue Code, apply to all businesses. Other types of business laws may apply to a specific industry, such as Federal Communications Commission laws that regulate radio and TV stations.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm350054976">In 1952 the United States grouped many business laws into a model that could be used by all the states. The <span data-type="term">Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)</span> sets forth the rules that apply to commercial transactions between businesses and between individuals and businesses. It has been adopted by 49 states; Louisiana uses only part of it. By standardizing laws, the UCC simplifies the process of doing business across state lines. It covers the sale of goods, bank deposits and collections, letters of credit, documents of title, and investment securities.</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm346792608">The United States has a highly developed court system. This branch of government, the <span data-type="term">judiciary</span>, is responsible for settling disputes by applying and interpreting points of law. Although court decisions are the basis for common law, the courts also answer questions left unanswered by statutes and administrative rulings. They have the power to assure that these laws do not violate the federal or state constitutions.</p>
<section data-depth="3" id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm514711456"><h5 data-type="title">Trial Courts</h5>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm395184784">Most court cases start in the <span data-type="term">trial courts</span>, also called courts of general jurisdiction. The main federal trial courts are the U.S. district courts. There is at least one federal district court in each state. These courts hear cases involving serious federal crimes, immigration, postal regulations, disputes between citizens of different states, patents, copyrights, and bankruptcy. Specialized federal courts handle tax matters, international trade, and claims against the United States.</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm388469456">The losing party in a civil (noncriminal) case and a losing defendant in a criminal case may appeal the trial court’s decision to the next level in the judicial system, the <span data-type="term">appellate courts (courts of appeals)</span>. There are 12 U.S. circuit courts of appeals. Cases that begin in a federal district court are appealed to the court of appeals for that district. These courts may also review orders from administrative agencies. Likewise, the states have appellate courts and supreme courts for cases tried in state district or superior courts.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm392091152">No cases start in appellate courts. Their purpose is to review decisions of the lower courts and affirm, reverse, or modify the rulings.</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm392938720">The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest court in the nation. It is the only court specifically established by the U.S. Constitution. Any cases involving a state or in which an ambassador, public minister, or consul is a party are heard directly by the Supreme Court. Its main function is to review decisions by the U.S. circuit courts of appeals. Parties not satisfied with a decision of a state supreme court can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. But the Supreme Court accepts only those cases that it believes will have the greatest effect on the country, only about 200 of the thousands of appeals it gets each year.</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm392267552">Administrative agencies have limited judicial powers to regulate their special areas. These agencies exist at the federal, state, and local levels. For example, in 2017, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ordered satellite TV provider Dish Network to pay a fine of $280 million for violating the Do Not Call Registry, a clearinghouse for consumers who do not want to be contacted by telemarketers. A federal judge ruled that Dish Network was liable for more than 66 million calls that violated the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule.<sup><a href="#auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_eip-idm237911104" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></sup> A list of selected federal agencies is shown in <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm398735696" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></strong>.</p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_eip-idm237911104">Lesley Fair, “Court Orders $280 Million from Dish Network, Largest Ever Do Not Call Penalty,” https://www.ftc.gov, accessed June 23, 2017.</aside><table id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm398735696" summary=""><caption><span data-type="title"><!-- no-selfclose --></span></caption><thead>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm403035328">Settling disputes by going to court is both expensive and time-consuming. Even if the case is settled prior to the actual trial, sizable legal expenses can be incurred in preparing for trial. Therefore, many companies now use private arbitration and mediation firms as alternatives to litigation. Private firms offer these services, which are a high growth area within the legal profession.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm383924976">With <span data-type="term">arbitration</span>, the parties agree to present their case to an impartial third party and are required to accept the arbitrator’s decision. <span data-type="term">Mediation</span> is similar, but the parties are not bound by the mediator’s decision. The mediator suggests alternative solutions and helps the parties negotiate a settlement. Mediation is more flexible than arbitration and allows for compromise. If the parties cannot reach a settlement, they can then go to court, an option not available in most arbitration cases.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm387401392">In addition to saving time and money, corporations like the confidentiality of testimony and settlement terms in these proceedings. Arbitration and mediation also allow businesses and medical professionals to avoid jury trials, which can result in large settlements in certain types of lawsuits, such as personal injury, discrimination, medical malpractice, and product liability.</p>

<ol id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm370122336" start="2">
<li>What are the required elements of a valid contract, and what are the key types of business law?</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm385891552">Linda Price, a 22-year-old college student, is looking at a car with a sticker price of $18,000. After some negotiating, she and the salesperson agree on a price of $17,000, and the salesperson writes up a contract, which they both sign. Has Linda legally bought the car for $17,000? The answer is yes, because the transaction meets all the requirements for a valid contract.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm403409552">A <span data-type="term">contract</span> is an agreement that sets forth the relationship between parties regarding the performance of a specified action. The contract creates a legal obligation and is enforceable in a court of law. Contracts are an important part of business law. Contract law is also incorporated into other fields of business law, such as property and agency law. Some of the business transactions that involve contracts are buying materials and property, selling goods, leasing equipment, and hiring consultants.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm392300208">A contract can be an <em data-effect="italics">express contract,</em> which specifies the terms of the agreement in either written or spoken words, or an <em data-effect="italics">implied contract</em>, which depends on the acts and conduct of the parties to show agreement. An example of an express contract is the written sales contract for Linda Price’s new car. An implied contract exists when you order and receive a sandwich at Jason’s Grill. You and the restaurant have an implied contract that you will pay the price shown on the restaurant’s menu in exchange for an edible sandwich.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm382859760"><h4 data-type="title">Contract Requirements</h4>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm359508976">Businesses deal with contracts all the time, so it’s important to know the requirements of a valid contract. For a contract to be legally enforceable, all of the following elements must be present:</p>
<ul id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm358262496">
<li><em data-effect="italics">Mutual assent.</em> Voluntary agreement by both parties to the terms of the contract. Each party to the contract must have entered into it freely, without duress. Using physical or economic harm to force the signing of the contract—threatening injury or refusing to place another large order, for instance—invalidates a contract. Likewise, fraud—misrepresenting the facts of a transaction—makes a contract unenforceable. Telling a prospective used-car buyer that the brakes are new when in fact they have not been replaced makes the contract of sale invalid.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Capacity.</em> Legal ability of a party to enter into contracts. Under the law, minors (those under 18), mental incompetents, drug and alcohol addicts, and convicts cannot enter into contracts.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Consideration.</em> Exchange of some legal value or benefit between the parties. Consideration can be in the form of money, goods, or a legal right given up. Suppose that an electronics manufacturer agrees to rent an industrial building for a year at a monthly rent of $1,500. Its consideration is the rent payment of $1,500, and the building owner’s consideration is permission to occupy the space. But if you offer to type a term paper for a friend for free and your offer is accepted, there is no contract. Your friend has not given up anything, so you are not legally bound to honor the deal.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Legal purpose.</em> Absence of illegality. The purpose of the contract must be legal for it to be valid. A contract cannot require performance of an illegal act. A contract to smuggle drugs into a state for a specified amount of money would not be legally enforceable.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Legal form.</em> Oral or written form, as required. Many contracts can be oral. For instance, an oral contract exists when Bridge Corp. orders office supplies by phone from Ace Stationery Store and Ace delivers the requested goods. Written contracts include leases, sales contracts, and property deeds. Some types of contracts must be in writing to be legally binding. In most states, written contracts are required for the sale of goods costing more than $500, for the sale of land, for contract performance that cannot be carried out within a year, and for guarantees to pay the debts of someone else.</li>

Both parties have freely agreed to the terms of the contract. Linda is not a minor and presumably does not fit any of the other categories of incapacity. Both parties are giving consideration, Linda by paying the money and the salesperson by turning over the car to her. The purchase of the car is a legal activity. And the written contract is the correct form because the cost of the car is over $500.</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm403130880">A <span data-type="term">breach of contract</span> occurs when one party to a contract fails (without legal excuse) to fulfill the terms of the agreement. The other party then has the right to seek a remedy in the courts. There are three legal remedies for breach of contract:</p>
<ul id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm368523456">
<li><em data-effect="italics">Payment of damages.</em> Money awarded to the party who was harmed by the breach of contract, to cover losses incurred because the contract wasn’t fulfilled. Suppose that Ajax Roofing contracts with Fred Wellman to fix the large hole in the roof of his factory within three days. But the roofing crew doesn’t show up as promised. When a thunderstorm four days later causes $45,000 in damage to Wellman’s machinery, Wellman can sue for damages to cover the costs of the water damage because Ajax breached the contract.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Specific performance of the contract.</em> A court order requiring the breaching party to perform the duties under the terms of the contract. Specific performance is the most common method of settling a breach of contract. Wellman might ask the court to direct Ajax to fix the roof at the price and conditions in the contract.</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Restitution.</em> Canceling the contract and returning to the situation that existed before the contract. If one party fails to perform under the contract, neither party has any further obligation to the other. Because Ajax failed to fix Wellman’s roof under the terms of the contract, Wellman does not owe Ajax any money. Ajax must return the 50 percent deposit it received when Wellman signed the contract.</li></ul>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm346765904"><em data-effect="italics">Express warranties</em> are specific statements of fact or promises about a product by the seller. This form of warranty is considered part of the sales transaction that influences the buyer. Express warranties appear in the form of statements that can be interpreted as fact. The statement “This machine will process 1,000 gallons of paint per hour” is an express warranty, as is the printed warranty that comes with a computer or a telephone answering machine.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm398355840"><em data-effect="italics">Implied warranties</em> are neither written nor oral. These guarantees are imposed on sales transactions by statute or court decision. They promise that the product will perform up to expected standards. For instance, a man bought a used car from a dealer, and the next day the transmission fell out as he was driving on the highway. The dealer fixed the car, but a week later the brakes failed. The man sued the car dealer. The court ruled in favor of the car owner because any car without a working transmission or brakes is not fit for the ordinary purpose of driving. Similarly, if a customer asks to buy a copier to handle 5,000 copies per month, she relies on the salesperson to sell her a copier that meets those needs. The salesperson implicitly warrants that the copier purchased is appropriate for that volume.</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm386139232">The U.S. Constitution protects authors, inventors, and creators of other intellectual property by giving them the rights to their creative works. Patents, copyrights, and registration of trademarks and servicemarks are legal protection for key business assets.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm360429920">A <span data-type="term">patent</span> gives an inventor the exclusive right to manufacture, use, and sell an invention for 20 years. The U.S. Patent Office, a government agency, grants patents for ideas that meet its requirements of being new, unique, and useful. The physical process, machine, or formula is what is patented. Patent rights—pharmaceutical companies’ rights to produce drugs they discover, for example—are considered intangible personal property.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm368948816">The government also grants copyrights. A <span data-type="term">copyright</span> is an exclusive right, shown by the symbol ©, given to a writer, artist, composer, or playwright to use, produce, and sell her or his creation. Works protected by copyright include printed materials (books, magazine articles, lectures), works of art, photographs, and movies. Under current copyright law, the copyright is issued for the life of the creator plus 70 years after the creator’s death. Patents and copyrights, which are considered intellectual property, are the subject of many lawsuits today.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm375711488">A <span data-type="term">trademark</span> is a design, name, or other distinctive mark that a manufacturer uses to identify its goods in the marketplace. Apple’s “bitten apple” logo (symbol) is an example of a trademark. A <span data-type="term">servicemark</span> is a symbol, name, or design that identifies a service rather than a tangible object. The Travelers Insurance umbrella logo is an example of a servicemark.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm534335536">Most companies identify their trademark with the ® symbol in company ads. This symbol shows that the trademark is registered with the Register of Copyrights, Copyright Office, Library of Congress. The trademark is followed by a generic description: Fritos corn chips, Xerox copiers, Scotch brand tape, Kleenex tissues.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm375388352">Trademarks are valuable because they create uniqueness in the minds of customers. At the same time, companies don’t want a trademark to become so well known that it is used to describe all similar types of products. For instance, Coke is often used to refer to any cola soft drink, not just those produced by The Coca-Cola Company. Companies spend millions of dollars each year to keep their trademarks from becoming <em data-effect="italics">generic words,</em> terms used to identify a product class rather than the specific product. The Coca-Cola Company employs many investigators and files many lawsuits each year to prevent its trademarks from becoming generic words.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm357184160">Once a trademark becomes generic (which a court decides), it is public property and can be used by any person or company. Names that were once trademarked but are now generic include <em data-effect="italics">aspirin, thermos, linoleum,</em> and <em data-effect="italics">toll house cookies.</em></p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm375704592">A <span data-type="term">tort</span> is a civil, or private, act that harms other people or their property. The harm may involve physical injury, emotional distress, invasion of privacy, or <em data-effect="italics">defamation</em> (injuring a person’s character by publication of false statements). The injured party may sue the wrongdoer to recover damages for the harm or loss. A tort is not the result of a breach of contract, which would be settled under contract law. Torts are part of common law. Examples of tort cases are medical malpractice, <em data-effect="italics">slander</em> (an untrue oral statement that damages a person’s reputation), <em data-effect="italics">libel</em> (an untrue written statement that damages a person’s reputation), product liability (discussed in the next section), and fraud.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm375398784">A tort is generally not a crime, although some acts can be both torts and crimes. (Assault and battery, for instance, is a criminal act that would be prosecuted by the state and also a tort because of the injury to the person.) Torts are private wrongs and are settled in civil courts. <em data-effect="italics">Crimes</em> are violations of public law punishable by the state or county in the criminal courts. The purpose of criminal law is to punish the person who committed the crime. The purpose of tort law is to provide remedies to the injured party.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm385593392">For a tort to exist and damages to be recovered, the harm must be done through either negligence or deliberate intent. <em data-effect="italics">Negligence</em> occurs when reasonable care is not taken for the safety of others. For instance, a woman attending a New York Mets baseball game was struck on the head by a foul ball that came through a hole in the screen behind home plate. The court ruled that a sports team charging admission has an obligation to provide structures free from defects and seating that protects spectators from danger. The Mets were found negligent. Negligence does not apply when an injury is caused by an unavoidable accident, an event that was not intended and could not have been prevented even if the person used reasonable care. This area of tort law is quite controversial, because the definition of negligence leaves much room for interpretation.</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm388615632"><span data-type="term">Product liability</span> refers to manufacturers’ and sellers’ responsibility for defects in the products they make and sell. It has become a specialized area of law combining aspects of contracts, warranties, torts, and statutory law (at both the state and federal levels). A product-liability suit may be based on negligence or strict liability (both of which are torts) or misrepresentation or breach of warranty (part of contract law).</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm370142320">An important concept in product-liability law is <span data-type="term">strict liability</span>. A manufacturer or seller is liable for any personal injury or property damage caused by defective products or packaging—even if all possible care was used to prevent such defects. The definition of defective is quite broad. It includes manufacturing and design defects and inadequate instructions on product use or warnings of danger.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm387055216">Product-liability suits are very costly. More than 100,000 product-liability suits were filed against hundreds of companies that made or used asbestos, a substance that causes lung disease and cancer but was once used widely in insulation, brake linings, textiles, and other products. Scores of companies were forced into bankruptcy as a result of asbestos-related lawsuits, and the total cost of asbestos cases to defendants and their insurers exceeds $70 billion (most of which was paid not to the victims but to lawyers and experts).</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm386645904">Congress has given financially distressed firms and individuals a way to make a fresh start. <span data-type="term">Bankruptcy</span> is the legal procedure by which individuals or businesses that cannot meet their financial obligations are relieved of their debts. A bankruptcy court distributes any assets to the creditors.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm401281760">Bankruptcy can be either voluntary or involuntary. In a <em data-effect="italics">voluntary bankruptcy,</em> the debtor files a petition with the court, stating that debts exceed assets and asking the court to declare the debtor bankrupt. In an <em data-effect="italics">involuntary bankruptcy,</em> the creditors file the bankruptcy petition.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm404923344">The <em data-effect="italics">Bankruptcy Reform Act</em> of 1978, amended in 1984 and 1986, provides for the resolution of bankruptcy cases. Under this act, two types of bankruptcy proceedings are available to businesses: <em data-effect="italics">Chapter 7</em> (liquidation) and <em data-effect="italics">Chapter 11</em> (reorganization). Most bankruptcies, an estimated 70 percent, use Chapter 7. After the sale of any assets, the cash proceeds are given first to secured creditors and then to unsecured creditors. A firm that opts to reorganize under Chapter 11 works with its creditors to develop a plan for paying part of its debts and writing off the rest.</p><p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm392341568">The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act went into effect October 17, 2005. Under this law, Americans with heavy debt will find it difficult to avoid meeting their financial obligations. Many debtors will have to work out repayment plans instead of having their obligations erased in bankruptcy court.<sup><a href="#auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_eip-idm237928304" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></sup></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_eip-idm237928304">“Changes in Bankruptcy Laws—Credit Counseling, Means Test,” http://www.creditinfocenter.com, May 10, 2016.</aside><p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm386586400">The law requires people with incomes above a certain level to pay some or all of their credit-card charges, medical bills, and other obligations under a court-ordered bankruptcy plan. Supporters of the 2005 law argue that bankruptcy frequently is the last refuge of gamblers, impulsive shoppers, the divorced or separated, and fathers avoiding child support. Now there is an objective, needs-based bankruptcy test to determine whether filers should be allowed to cancel their debts or be required to enter a repayment plan. Generally, people with incomes above the state median income would be required to use a plan to repay their debts. People with special circumstances, such as serious medical conditions, would be allowed to cancel debts despite this income level.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm395708768">Also, companies will need a lot more cash to enter into a bankruptcy than in the past. Before the 2005 law, utilities could not discontinue service as a result of a bankruptcy filing. But under the new act, the filing company must post a cash deposit or equivalent in order to continue their service. Sellers also have priority over other claims with regard to merchandise distributed to the debtor within 20 days prior to the bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm410249664">The act limits the debtor’s exclusivity period, which was a real boon of filing for bankruptcy. Past law allowed for indefinite extensions, which served to drag out the time before bondholders and other creditors get any money. But now that period is capped at 18 months, with no room for extension. For large corporations with complicated bankruptcies, such a quick turnaround may not be possible, and if a plan is not filed at the end of 18 months, the company must put itself at the mercy of creditors.</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm387007872">Many measures have been taken to try to keep the marketplace free from influences that would restrict competition. These efforts include <span data-type="term">antitrust regulation</span>, laws that prevent companies from entering into agreements to control trade through a monopoly. The first act regulating competition was the <em data-effect="italics">Sherman Antitrust Act</em>, passed in 1890 to prevent large companies from dominating an industry and making it hard for smaller firms to compete. This broad act banned monopolies and contracts, mergers, or conspiracies in restraint of trade. In 1914 the <em data-effect="italics">Clayton Act</em> added to the more general provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act. It outlawed the following:</p>
<ul id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm391221536">
<li><em data-effect="italics">Price discrimination.</em> Offering a customer discounts that are not offered to all other purchasers buying on similar terms</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Exclusive dealing.</em> Refusing to let the buyer purchase a competitor’s products for resale</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Tying contracts.</em> Requiring buyers to purchase merchandise they may not want in order to get the products they do want</li>
<li><em data-effect="italics">Purchase of stock in competing corporations so as to lessen competition.</em> Buying competitors’ stock in such quantity that competition is reduced</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm396446176">The 1950 <em data-effect="italics">Celler-Kefauver Act</em> amended the Clayton Act. It bans the purchase of one firm by another if the resulting merger decreases competition within the industry. As a result, all corporate acquisitions are subject to regulatory approval before they can be finalized. Most antitrust actions are taken by the U.S. Department of Justice, based on federal law. Violations of the antitrust acts are punishable by fines, imprisonment, or civil damage payments that can be as high as three times the actual damage amount. These outcomes give defendants an incentive to resolve cases.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm384959904">The <em data-effect="italics">Federal Trade Commission Act,</em> also passed in 1914, bans unfair trade practices. This act created the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), an independent five-member board with the power to define and monitor unfair trade practices, such as those prohibited by the Sherman and Clayton Acts. The FTC investigates complaints and can issue rulings called <em data-effect="italics">cease-and-desist orders</em> to force companies to stop unfair business practices. Its powers have grown over the years. Today the FTC is one of the most important agencies regulating the competitive practices of business.</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm369815584">A number of federal laws directly affect the promotion and pricing of products. The <em data-effect="italics">Wheeler-Lea Act</em> of 1938 amended the Federal Trade Commission Act and gave the FTC authority to regulate advertising. The FTC monitors companies’ advertisements for false or misleading claims.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm359554064">The most important law in the area of pricing is the <em data-effect="italics">Robinson-Patman Act,</em> a federal law passed in 1936 that tightened the Clayton Act’s prohibitions against price discrimination. An exception is made for circumstances like discounts for quantity purchases, as long as the discounts do not lessen competition. But a manufacturer cannot sell at a lower price to one company just because that company buys all its merchandise from the manufacturer. Also, if one firm is offered quantity discounts, all firms buying that quantity of goods must get the discounts. The FTC and the antitrust division of the Justice Department monitor pricing.</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm401703552">During the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. government actively promoted <span data-type="term">deregulation</span>, the removal of rules and regulations governing business competition. Deregulation drastically changed some once-regulated industries (especially the transportation, telecommunications, and financial services industries) and created many new competitors. The result has been entries into and exits from some industries. One of the latest industries to deregulate is the electric power industry. With almost 200 investor-owned electric utilities, it is the largest industry to be deregulated so far.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm403412816">Consumers typically benefit from deregulation. Increased competition often means lower prices. Businesses also benefit because they have more freedom to operate and can avoid the costs associated with government regulations. But more competition can also make it hard for small or weak firms to survive.</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm382781120">Use of the internet has exploded over the past decade. Recent estimates suggest that more than half of the world’s population use the web to purchase goods and services, book travel plans, conduct banking and pay bills, stream original content, read the latest news and sports information, look up facts and figures, and keep up with friends, family, and business associates via Skype, FaceTime, Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms.<sup><a href="#auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_eip-idm352348480" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></sup></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_eip-idm352348480">“Digital in 2017: Global Overview,” <em data-effect="italics">The Next Web,</em> https://thenextweb.com, accessed June 23, 2017.</aside><p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm407534480">Internet access and regulation continue to be a concern for many interest groups, including privacy advocates, internet providers, private citizens, technology companies, and the government, to name a few. In 2017, President Trump signed legislation overturning the internet privacy protections originally put in place by the Obama administration. Under the new legislation, internet providers will now be able to collect, store, share, and sell certain types of customer information without their consent. Under previous legislation, sharing this type of data would have required consumers’ permission. With this new law, companies such as Verizon and Comcast will be able to mine user data and use that information to compete in the $83 billion digital advertising market with companies such as Google and Facebook.<sup><a href="#auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_eip-idm241828016" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></sup> The internet environment is extremely dynamic, so consumers and other interest groups should monitor how regulations and other policies will continue to change the ground rules for internet use.</p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_eip-idm241828016">Brian Fung, “Trump Has Signed Repeal of FCC’s Internet Privacy Rule.

<li>What are the most common taxes paid by businesses?</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm244466944">Taxes are sometimes seen as the price we pay to live in this country. Taxes are assessed by all levels of government on both business and individuals, and they are used to pay for the services provided by government. The federal government is the largest collector of taxes, accounting for 52 percent of all tax dollars. States are next, followed closely by local government taxes. The average American family pays about 37 percent of its income for taxes, 28 percent to the federal government and 9 percent to state and local governments.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm234563840"><h4 data-type="title">Income Taxes</h4>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm239638064"><span data-type="term">Income taxes</span> are based on the income received by businesses and individuals. The income taxes paid to the federal government are set by Congress, regulated by the Internal Revenue Code, and collected by the Internal Revenue Service. These taxes are <em data-effect="italics">progressive</em>, meaning that rates increase as income increases. Most of the states and some large cities also collect income taxes from individuals and businesses. The state and local governments establish their own rules and tax rates.</p>

<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm251731600">Besides income taxes, individuals and businesses pay a number of other taxes. The four main types are property taxes, payroll taxes, sales taxes, and excise taxes.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm252415456"><span data-type="term">Property taxes</span> are assessed on real and personal property, based on the assessed value of the property. They raise quite a bit of revenue for state and local governments. Most states tax land and buildings. Property taxes may be based on fair market value (what a buyer would pay), a percentage of fair market value, or replacement value (what it would cost today to rebuild or buy something like the original). The value on which the taxes are based is the assessed value.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm254579440">Any business that has employees and meets a payroll must pay <span data-type="term">payroll taxes</span>, the employer’s share of Social Security taxes and federal and state unemployment taxes. These taxes must be paid on wages, salaries, and commissions. State unemployment taxes are based on the number of employees in a firm who have become eligible for unemployment benefits. A firm that has never had an employee become eligible for unemployment will pay a low rate of state unemployment taxes. The firm’s experience with employment benefits does not affect federal unemployment tax rates.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm239572544"><span data-type="term">Sales taxes</span> are levied on goods when they are sold and are a percentage of the sales price. These taxes are imposed by states, counties, and cities. They vary in amount and in what is considered taxable. Some states have no sales tax. Others tax some categories (such as appliances) but not others (such as clothes). Still others tax all retail products except food, magazines, and prescription drugs. Sales taxes increase the cost of goods to the consumer. Businesses bear the burden of collecting sales taxes and sending them to the government.</p>
<p id="auto_6c67bb99-c2bc-4f83-a0ad-74b0aaccc971_fs-idm233330064"><span data-type="term">Excise taxes</span> are placed on specific items, such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, airline tickets, cars, and guns. They can be assessed by federal, state, and local governments. In many cases, these taxes help pay for services related to the item taxed. For instance, gasoline excise taxes are often used to build and repair highways. Other excise taxes—such as those on alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and guns—are used to control practices that may cause harm.</p>
