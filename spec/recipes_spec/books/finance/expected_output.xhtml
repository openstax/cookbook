The book is designed for conceptual accessibility to students who are relatively early in their business curriculum (such as second-year students), yet it is also suitable for more advanced students. Due to the wide range of audiences and course approaches, the book is designed to be as flexible as possible. Its modular structure allows the introduction and review of content from prerequisite subjects in financial accounting, statistics, and economics, depending on student preparation. It provides a solid grounding in the core concepts of financial theory so that business students interested in a major or minor in finance will also be prepared for more rigorous upper-level elective courses. Concepts are further reinforced through applicable connections and practical calculation techniques for more detailed and realistic company scenarios from various industries.</p>

            <p id="auto_6fa95340-9ccc-40c5-b4f3-014d40bd3c2f_para-00001">Finance is essential to the management of a business or organization. Without good financial protocol, safeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-owned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of commercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family ownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam War, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest rates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national economy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.</p>
            <p id="auto_6fa95340-9ccc-40c5-b4f3-014d40bd3c2f_para-00002">In the early 1980s, the company&#x2019;s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that the custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The owner worked with the company&#x2019;s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a production, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger companies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a commitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs&#x2019; reputation for quality grew, so did demand for its products. The original financing plan anticipated this potential growth and was designed to meet anticipated capital requirements so that the firm could expand how and when it needed to.</p>
            <p class="has-noteref" id="auto_6fa95340-9ccc-40c5-b4f3-014d40bd3c2f_para-00003">Bacon Signs&#x2019; ability to manufacture and deliver a high-quality product at a good price was the true value of the firm. However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would not have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and financial stability for the firm.<a href="#auto_6fa95340-9ccc-40c5-b4f3-014d40bd3c2f_foot-00001" role="doc-noteref" type="noteref">1</a></p>

Finance is also a tool that can help us be better decision makers.</p>

Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the company, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth. Consequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: &#x201C;How does this decision impact the wealth of the shareholders?&#x201D; and &#x201C;Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?&#x201D;</p>
            <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00005">In business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_fig-00002">Figure 1.3</a>).</p>

The chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for how to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for the extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-term creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department&#x2019;s policies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others, they are separate.</li>
              <li><strong data-effect="bold">Capital budgeting</strong> is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to maximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital budgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital budgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size, timing, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and compiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources, and economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the value of the firm.</li>

Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with economists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial information and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included each of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.</li>

TARP authorized the Treasury to buy illiquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically this was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end, however, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery, most financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout. However, individual homeowners suffered greatly.</p>

Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect consumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial institutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won&#x2019;t be left out in the cold due to actions beyond their control.</p>

Sure, but think how much more convenient and safer it is to carry a card or use an app instead of cash. In addition, these services allow you to easily track where and how you spend your money. A well-regulated and independent financial system is important to capital-based economies. Our smoothly functioning financial system has removed us from the days of strictly bartering to our system today, where transactions are as simple as a tap on your mobile phone.</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00021">There are any number of professional and personal reasons to study finance. A search of the internet provides a long list of finance-related professions. Interviews with senior managers reveal that an understanding of financial tools and concepts is an important consideration in hiring new employees. Financial skills are among the most important tools for advancement toward greater responsibility and remuneration. Government and work-guaranteed pension benefits are growing less common and less generous, meaning individuals must take greater responsibility for their personal financial well-being now and at retirement. Let&#x2019;s take a closer look at some of the reasons why we study finance.</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00022">There are many career opportunities in the fields of finance. A single course in finance such as this one may pique your interest and encourage you to study more finance-related topics. These studies in turn may qualify you for engaging and high-paying finance careers. We take a closer look at financial career opportunities in Careers in Finance.</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00023">A career in finance is just one reason to study finance. Finance is an excellent decision-making tool; it requires analytical thinking. Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing, magnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as well, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or paychecks.</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00024">An understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment opportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real estate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification, and adequate returns. However, in today&#x2019;s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and cryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage of both new and old financial products.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Risk and Return in Finance</h3>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00026">Finance tells us that an increase in risk results in an increase in expected return. The study of historical financial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over time have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise, where&#x2019;s the risk?</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00027">At its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps individuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in our everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or walking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety. Should you buy the required text for your class or instead rely on the professor&#x2019;s notes and the internet? Should you buy that new-to-you used car sight unseen, or should you spend the money for a mechanic to assess the vehicle before you buy? Should you accept your first job offer at graduation or hold out for the offer you really want? A better understanding of finance makes these types of decisions easier and can provide you, as the decision maker, with statistics instead of just intuition.</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00028">Return is compensation for making an investment and waiting for the benefit (see <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_fig-00003">Figure 1.4</a>). Return could be the interest earned on an investment in a bond or the dividend from the purchase of stock. Return could be the higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education. Individuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the expectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds were the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings account, and that means investors expect a greater average return.</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00029">The study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-return trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different definitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the characteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar &#x201C;bell-shaped&#x201D; curve you studied in your statistics classes. Understanding a security&#x2019;s average and variability of returns can help us estimate the range and likelihood of higher- or lower-than-expected outcomes. This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate prices that satisfy investors&#x2019; required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or uncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already &#x201C;know.&#x201D;</p>

Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting activities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts receivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and liability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for monitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.</p>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00003">In most organizations, the <span data-type="term" group-by="t" id="auto_page_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_term30">treasurer</span> might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the treasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for bankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring loan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also responsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the treasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Financial Planning</h3>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00006">Financial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit. Financial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions required to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners. These could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a &#x201C;mom and pop&#x201D; store, partners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning helps managers understand the firm&#x2019;s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue objectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning process, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans typically consider the firm&#x2019;s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as the development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was thorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial banks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm&#x2019;s expansion.</p>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00007">Good financial planning has a number of common features.</p>
          <ul id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_list-00002">

Pro forma income statements are created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income statements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.</li>
            <li>Cash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the timing and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.</li>
            <li>Balance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most important aspects of business is accounting (see <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_fig-00001">Figure 1.5</a>).</li>
            <li>Forecasting in the form of expected sales, cost of funds, and microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions are essential elements of financial planning.</li>
            <li>Financial analysis including ratio analysis, common-size financial statements, and trend statements are important aspects of financial planning. Such analysis aids in the understanding of where a firm has been, how it stacks up against the competition, and the assessment of target objectives.</li>

          <h3 data-type="title">Forecasting and Budgeting</h3>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00009">Forecasting and budgeting are common practices for businesses, governmental agencies, not-for-profit firms, and individual households. As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are valuable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of cash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget well before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by developing financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the future. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its objectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and magnitude of expected cash flows.</p>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00010">Financial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify the differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those changes. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that &#x201C;plans are worthless, but planning is everything.&#x201D; That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and government. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps navigate the inevitable detours toward the firm&#x2019;s objectives.</p>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00011">The budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and balance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives and serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to determine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The process should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a periodic renewal and reminder of the firm&#x2019;s goals.</p>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00012">Financial forecasting often starts with the firm&#x2019;s budget and recommends changes based on differences between the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in the immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Importance of Data</h3>
          <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00002">Financial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data leads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the creation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow, and balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders such as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having current and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform managers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to make regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. &#x201C;Gut feelings&#x201D; and &#x201C;seat-of-the-pants&#x201D; decision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.</p>
          <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00003">Outsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory decisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm&#x2019;s financial information. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need data to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should supply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.</p>

          <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00004">Financial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and develop at least three essential financial statements or reports.</p>

            <li>The income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income statements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.</li>
            <li>Statements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.</li>
            <li>Balance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.</li>
          </ol>
          <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00005">These statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as accumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look forward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.</p>
          <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00006">In addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek external sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market research, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with government officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand, unemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.</p>

              <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00010">Should you lease a new car or buy one? Do you opt for the more expensive high-tech production equipment or reduce your upfront investment and pay higher labor costs over time? Is it better to finance a new product by borrowing money or selling new shares of stock? Should you manufacture overseas where the production costs are lower or in your own country where political and transportation costs are lower? Once you make your choice, how do you know if you&#x2019;ve made the right decision? Understanding and applying financial principles can help.</p>
              <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00011">For example, consider Peloton, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In 2012, the principal founder, John <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="F" id="auto_page_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_term41">Foley</span>, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to attend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family. He enjoyed cycling classes, but they could be expensive and often did not fit into his schedule. He recognized that the most popular instructors had developed a bit of a cult following and that the music playlist was a critical component for many followers. His choice of the company name, Peloton, comes from the French word for a &#x201C;pack of bike riders,&#x201D; familiar to anyone who has even loosely followed the annual Tour de France bike race. The company name evokes a measure of mystique and prestige.</p>
              <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00012">Peloton started small and underwent five funding rounds in seven years before the company went public with an initial public offering in September 2019. Foley and his friends had the idea that they were a &#x201C;purposeful music company&#x201D; and needed to touch on all aspects of the workout experience including the bike; video, audio, and music content; clothing design; competition among the riders; data gathering; and instructors for livestream and on-demand classes. They were selling an experience, not a bicycle. The equipment is expensive&#x2014;a Peloton bike typically costs over $2,000. Peloton equips its studios with state-of-the-art camera and music systems and pays its instructors top dollar. Along the way, the founders made several critical financial decisions. They kept control of the firm by using private funding at the start.</p>
              <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00013">How can we tell if Peloton has managed its resources well? The company started with $400,000 of funding to develop a prototype in 2012. By 2018, firm value increased to $4 billion with yet another round of private investor funding. As of April 2021, Peloton is a publicly traded company with a stock value of $34 billion. The executives are sacrificing profits in the short term to generate growth and long-term profitability. The firm uses its financial statements to identify sources and uses of funds, to test the effectiveness of advertising, and to forecast future profitability. Analysts like the firm, the stock price is up, and by many financial measures, Peloton has been a great success. Time will tell if the decisions made over the last several years will lead to long-term profitability or if the company has overinvested in marketing only to miss current and long-term profits.</p>

Job descriptions vary across firms, industries, and government organizations. However, the role of financial analyst usually includes market research, financial forecasting, modeling, cost analysis, and comparative valuations. Financial analysts gather data and produce financial reports in conjunction with multiple departments within a business or organization. They rely on marketing and production personnel to provide accurate sales forecasts, and they work with accountants to create accurate financial reports.</p>
          <p id="auto_67739711-5c7f-4499-963f-a27a11fb5003_para-00006">As a financial analyst, you need strong spreadsheet skills, the ability to develop financial models and pro forma financial statements, outstanding analytical skills, and an overall understanding of business processes. Financial analysts possess a well-diversified collection of business and communication skills, both quantitative and qualitative. <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_67739711-5c7f-4499-963f-a27a11fb5003_fig-00001">Figure 1.6</a> lists some tasks that financial analysts must perform on a daily basis.

Responsibilities include keeping current with market conditions, developing financial models, reconciling variance between forecasts and outcomes, and serving as a resource for management.

However, the strong quantitative skills required for a financial analyst are less emphasized in favor of overall strategic thinking.

The presence of these players makes financial transactions, easier, faster, and safer&#x2014;essentially more efficient. You and your friends might engage in direct financial transactions, such as buying a coffee or borrowing money for a movie. These are typically small transactions. However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need advanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks.

When a dealer engages in a financial transaction, they are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an individual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible. Instead, dealers attempt to &#x201C;make markets,&#x201D; meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current bid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to generate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price (what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a security). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market. Dealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" group-by="S" id="auto_page_99d4fc95-e3b5-4434-a93d-4499a17defb2_term61">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</span>.

For instance, a commercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment company pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds. These transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to buy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may create a completely different security all together. For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan created by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely earning interest, and you are not directly affected.</p>

However, occasionally lenders and borrowers are able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale, the process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s, inflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum rates of 5% on their savings deposits.<a href="#auto_99d4fc95-e3b5-4434-a93d-4499a17defb2_foot-00001" role="doc-noteref" type="noteref">7</a> Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest directly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities. This lack of deposit funds and the subsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant deregulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.</p>

Foreign investment adds risk and potential return to the decision-making process. Macroeconomic factors such as different inflation rates, unexpected changes in currency exchange rates, and mismatched economic growth all add to the uncertainty of making investments abroad. Just as important are government regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs. Toss in a pandemic, and a bottleneck or two, and suddenly international macroeconomic factors can affect almost every aspect of commerce and international trade.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Relationship between Microeconomics and Macroeconomics</h3>
          <p id="auto_6a92bcb9-cfcc-4cb4-86d4-2bb80f3d98f8_para-00014">The relationship between micro- and macroeconomics brings to mind the parable of the blind men and the elephant. In the parable, a group of blind men happen upon an elephant for the first time, and they each touch one part&#x2014;but one part only&#x2014;of the elephant. Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered, the descriptions are vastly different. The men become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate descriptions or worse. The parable demonstrates how people can make absolute truths from their own limited and subjective information. Financial decision makers run a similar risk if they choose to recognize only their own findings and ignore other microeconomic or macroeconomic information and the interaction of these factors.</p>
          <p id="auto_6a92bcb9-cfcc-4cb4-86d4-2bb80f3d98f8_para-00015">A common view to understanding economics states that macroeconomics is a top-down approach and microeconomics is a bottom-up approach. Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the individual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective. They need both the macro data, so important for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement. For example, the national rate of unemployment may not have been much help when Bacon Signs was searching for skilled laborers who could form neon signs. However, the unemployment rate helped inform the company about the probability of demand for new businesses and the signs they would need.</p>

Defaulting on money market instruments is not unheard of, but it is very rare. &#x201C;High liquidity&#x201D; means that money market instruments can generally be sold in a secondary market very quickly and at or near their current market value. Finally, money market securities are homogeneous, meaning that within an issue of securities, a single instrument is not unique. For example, if you purchase 13-week T-bills issued in the first week of January, each bill is identical to any other in the issue. Compare that to the purchase of physical assets such as a car or house, where each of the assets sold has some unique feature or measure of quality.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00003">Financial institutions, corporations, and governments that have short-term borrowing and/or lending needs issue securities in the money market. Most of the transactions are quite large, with typical amounts in excess of $100,000. These large transactions are the norm when trading federal funds, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, or negotiable certificates of deposit. Our sample company, Bacon Signs, was much too small to participate directly in the money market. However, Bacon Signs&#x2019; borrowing rates were affected by changes in the money market. Treasury bills are also a very important component of the money market, and they trade in smaller amounts starting at $10,000 per T-bill.</p>

T-bills are auctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short maturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local income taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt securities. In addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can trade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills has exceeded $75 billion.<a href="#auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_foot-00001" role="doc-noteref" type="noteref">9</a></p>

For example, credit card companies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper has a typical maturity of 270 days or less. The short maturity reduces SEC oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP means that only highly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper. The default rate on commercial paper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range during the financial crisis of 2008.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00006">Commercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount with the face value as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue commercial paper; thus, returns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for CP. Most purchasers are large, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial paper until maturity.</p>

They are redeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market. NCDs, or <em data-effect="italics">jumbo CDs</em>, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical minimums amounts are $1,000,000 with a maturity of two weeks to six months.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00008">NCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or credit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit insurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount but is much larger than a regular CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to cash out early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher rates on NCDs compared to CDs because they know they will have use of the purchase amount for the entire maturity of the NCD. The reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve are also lower than for other types of deposits.</p>

The federal funds market traditionally consists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial institutions, notably domestic commercial banks. The participants in the market negotiate the federal funds interest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate range in the federal funds market by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market. Many of the borrowing and lending rates in our economy are a direct function of the federal funds rate.</p>

The Treasury auctions notes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov in the same way they would a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in that they are longer term, pay semiannual coupon interest payments, and pay the par or face value of the note at maturity. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed. However, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally exempt from state and local taxes. There is an active secondary market for Treasury notes.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00013">Longer-term Treasury issues, <span data-type="term" group-by="T" id="auto_page_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_term84">Treasury bonds</span>, have maturities of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds are like T-notes in that they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at maturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00014">State and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of <span data-type="term" group-by="m" id="auto_page_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_term85">municipal bonds(&#x201C;munis&#x201D;)</span>. Local borrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is unlikely but possible. Thus, munis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to that of corporate bonds in that they receive a bond rating based on the perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that the interest payments are tax-free. Munis are exempt from federal, state, and local taxes, and this makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00015">Just as governments borrow money in the long-term from investors, so do corporations. A corporation often issues bonds for longer-term financing. Bond contracts identify very specific terms of agreement and outline the rules for the order, timing, and amount of contractual payments, as well as processes for when one or more of the required activities lapse. A bond contract, known as an indenture, includes both standard &#x201C;boilerplate&#x201D; contract language and specific conditions unique to a particular issue. Because of these non-standardized features of a bond contract, the secondary market for trading used bonds typically requires a broker, dealer, or investment company to facilitate a trade.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00016">An important goal of business executives is to maximize the owners&#x2019; wealth. For corporations, shares of stock represent ownership. Stocks are difficult to price compared to bonds. Bonds have contracts that specify the number and amount of all payments made by the firm to the purchasers of bonds. Stock cash flows are far more uncertain than bond cash flows. Stocks might or might not have periodic dividend payments, and an investor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future. However, no contract guarantees the size of the dividends or the time or resale price of the stock. Thus, the cash flows from stock ownership are more uncertain and risky than cash flows from bonds.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00017">Ownership of corporations is easily transferable if a company&#x2019;s stock trades in one of the organized stock exchanges or in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Most of the trading consists of used or previously issued stocks in the over-the-counter market and organized exchanges. The two largest stock exchanges in the world are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. Both exchanges are located in the United States.</p>

        <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00002">Many students don&#x2019;t have a choice between saving and spending. College is expensive, and it is easy to spend every dollar you earn and to borrow to meet the rest of your obligations. Businesses, however, continually make decisions about when and how much money to borrow or invest. Bacon Signs established banking relationships to borrow money when needed to expand the business or a product line. Sometimes the best decision is to invest as soon as possible to grab opportunities, and other times it is better to delay new investment in order to pay dividends to the owners of the company.</p>

Of course, the 30 companies have changed, but the index does represent a continuous yardstick to measure stock performance over time.

The next tenfold increase from 1,000 to 10,000 took only a little under 27 years from 1972 to 1999. Time will tell if or when the Dow 30 will top 100,000 at the closing bell.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Impact of Time on Saving and Spending</h3>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00004">The choice to spend or save and invest is really a choice between consumption today versus consumption in the future. Economists, investment advisers, your friends, and mine love to discuss the trade-off of consumption now or later&#x2014;even if not in those words. We have all heard conversations that go something like this: &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go grab a beer&#x2014;you can study for tomorrow&#x2019;s exam in the morning.&#x201D; Or &#x201C;My father&#x2019;s investment adviser told me that if I invest $500 per month for the next 30 years and earn an annual rate of 10% on my investments, I will have invested $180,000 over time but accumulated an investment portfolio worth over $1.13 million!&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00005">An important aspect of the trade-off between saving and spending involves your short-, intermediate-, and long-term goals. Delaying consumption until later comes with risks. Will your consumption choices still be available? Will the prices be attainable? Will you still be able to consume and enjoy your future purchases?</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00006">When saving for short-term objectives, the safety of the principal invested is important, and the value of compounding returns is minimal compared to longer-term investments. Most short-term investors have a low tolerance for risk and hope to beat the rate of inflation with a little extra besides. An example could be to start a holiday savings account at your local bank as a way to save, earn a small rate of return, and assure that you have funds set aside for consumption at the end of the year.</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00007">An intermediate investment may be to save for a new car or for the down payment on a house or vacation home. Again, maintaining the principal is important, but you have some time to recover from poor investment returns. Intermediate-term investments tend to earn higher average annual rates of return than short-term investments, but they also have greater uncertainty and risk.</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00008">Long-term investments have the advantage of enough time to recover from temporary poor performance and the luxury of compounded returns over a long period. Further, long-term investments tend to have greater risk and higher expected average annual rates of return. Even though this is a business finance text, sometimes a personal finance example is easier to relate to. To illustrate, <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_table-00002">Table 1.2</a> demonstrates four different investment scenarios. In scenario 1, you invest $5,000 annually from ages 26 through 60 into an account earning an average annual rate of return of 10% per year. Over your lifetime, you invest a total of $175,000, and at age 60, you have an estimated portfolio value of $1,490,634. This is a healthy amount that has almost certainly beaten the average annual rate of inflation. In scenario 1, by investing regularly, you accumulate roughly 8.5 times the value of what you invested. Congratulations, you can expect to become a millionaire!</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00009">Compare your results in scenario 1 with your college roommate in scenario 2, who is able to invest $5,000 per year from ages 19 through 25 and leave her investments until age 60 in an account that continues to earn an annual rate of 10%. She makes her investments earlier than yours, but they total only $35,000. However, despite a much smaller investment, her head start advantage and the high average annual compounded rate of return leave her with an expected portfolio value of $1,466,369. Her total is almost as great as the amount you would accumulate, but with a much smaller total investment.</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00010">Scenarios 3 and 4 are even more dramatic, as can be seen from a review of <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_table-00002">Table 1.2</a>. In both scenarios, only five $5,000 investments are made, but they are made earlier in the investor&#x2019;s life. Parents or grandparents could make these investments on behalf of the recipients. In both scenarios, the portfolios grow to amounts greater than those of you or your roommate with smaller total investments. The common factor is that greater time leads to additional compounding of the investments and thus greater future values.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Definition of Economic Value</h3>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00011"><em data-effect="italics">Value</em> is a term used frequently in business and especially in economics, accounting, and finance. Accountants track, record, and display value in the form of financial statements and footnotes. The numbers they present are &#x201C;book values&#x201D; and represent what has occurred. Financial people like to speak in terms of &#x201C;market values.&#x201D; Market values are calculated using expected future cash flows discounted to today. Market values are the prices that consumers pay for a product. <span data-type="term" group-by="E" id="auto_page_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_term88">Economic value</span> is what we believe consumers are actually willing to pay for a product, service, or experience. For example, the price of a movie ticket may be $10, but there are individuals who are willing to pay far more for the experience of watching a movie on the big screen.</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00012">Generally, the economic value is at least as great as the market value or current price of an asset. When Bacon Signs planned for the future, the firm attempted to determine the economic value of its products when creating an optimal mix of price and quantity sold. Firms that produce unique products for clients may have multiple prices based on the estimated economic value of their good or service to the client. One way to think about the difference between market value and economic value is that market value is what you have to pay, while economic value is what you are willing to pay.</p>
