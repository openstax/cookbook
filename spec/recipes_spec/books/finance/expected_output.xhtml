          <p id="auto_bf586686-91c5-4160-b5c5-fccde02d4ed9_para-00008"><em data-effect="italics">Principles of Finance</em> is targeted at the core finance course for undergraduate business majors. The book is designed for conceptual accessibility to students who are relatively early in their business curriculum (such as second-year students), yet it is also suitable for more advanced students. Due to the wide range of audiences and course approaches, the book is designed to be as flexible as possible. Its modular structure allows the introduction and review of content from prerequisite subjects in financial accounting, statistics, and economics, depending on student preparation. It provides a solid grounding in the core concepts of financial theory so that business students interested in a major or minor in finance will also be prepared for more rigorous upper-level courses. Concepts are further reinforced through applicable connections and practical calculation techniques for more detailed and realistic company scenarios from various industries.</p>

To illuminate the meaningful applications and implications of financial ideas, the book incorporates a unique use-case approach, providing connections among topics, solutions, and real-world problems. This multifaceted framework drives the integration of concepts while maintaining a modular chapter structure. Theoretical and practical aspects are presented in a balanced manner, and select ethical considerations are introduced, particularly in the context of corporate governance.</p>
          <p id="auto_bf586686-91c5-4160-b5c5-fccde02d4ed9_para-00050">In order to create meaning for all students, <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Finance</em> exposes them to a range of companies, industries, and scenarios reflecting different contexts. Examples of large companies such as Apple, Peloton, and American Airlines are balanced with small businesses&#x2014;coffee shops, clothing stores, and salons&#x2014;that may be more aligned with student experiences. The text includes authentic narratives from corporate finance, small business, and personal finance to drive relevance and interest of the discipline. Profiles and interviews include diverse figures in finance, such as Carlos Slim, Irina Simmons, Janet Yellen, and Ben Bernanke. Problems and exercises have been carefully constructed to place students into a range of settings and contexts, as they develop knowledge and put it into practice. Finally, to reflect very recent experiences, the authors have incorporated several discussions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on people and businesses.</p>
          <p id="auto_bf586686-91c5-4160-b5c5-fccde02d4ed9_para-00011">Throughout, there is an emphasis on data use in business decision-making, with integrative sections on the importance and analysis of financial, economic, and statistical data.

            <p id="auto_6fa95340-9ccc-40c5-b4f3-014d40bd3c2f_para-00001">Finance is essential to the management of a business or organization. Without good financial protocol, safeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-owned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of commercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family ownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam War, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest rates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national economy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.</p>
            <p id="auto_6fa95340-9ccc-40c5-b4f3-014d40bd3c2f_para-00002">In the early 1980s, the company&#x2019;s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that the custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The owner worked with the company&#x2019;s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a production, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger companies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a commitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs&#x2019; reputation for quality grew, so did demand for its products. The original financing plan anticipated this potential growth and was designed to meet anticipated capital requirements so that the firm could expand how and when it needed to.</p>
            <p id="auto_6fa95340-9ccc-40c5-b4f3-014d40bd3c2f_para-00003" class="has-noteref">Bacon Signs&#x2019; ability to manufacture and deliver a high-quality product at a good price was the true value of the firm. However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would not have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and financial stability for the firm.<a href="#auto_6fa95340-9ccc-40c5-b4f3-014d40bd3c2f_foot-00001" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">1</a></p>

          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00002">Finance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The word <em data-effect="italics">finance</em> can be used as a verb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as a noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and sources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better decision makers.</p>

Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the company, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth. Consequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: &#x201C;How does this decision impact the wealth of the shareholders?&#x201D; and &#x201C;Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?&#x201D;</p>
            <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00005">In business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see <a href="#auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_fig-00002" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.3</a>).</p>

The chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for how to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for the extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-term creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department&#x2019;s policies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others, they are separate.</li>
              <li><strong data-effect="bold">Capital budgeting</strong> is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to maximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital budgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital budgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size, timing, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and compiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources, and economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the value of the firm.</li>

Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with economists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial information and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included each of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.</li>

TARP authorized the Treasury to buy illiquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically this was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end, however, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery, most financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout. However, individual homeowners suffered greatly.</p>

Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect consumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial institutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won&#x2019;t be left out in the cold due to actions beyond their control.</p>

          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00020">Finance is the lubricant that keeps our economy running smoothly. Issuing a mortgage can be profitable for a bank, but it also allows people to live in their own homes and to pay for them over time. Do <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_term-00021" group-by="M">MasterCard</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_term-00022" group-by="V">Venmo</span>, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_term-00023" group-by="P">PayPal</span> make money when you use their product? Sure, but think how much more convenient and safer it is to carry a card or use an app instead of cash. In addition, these services allow you to easily track where and how you spend your money. A well-regulated and independent financial system is important to capital-based economies. Our smoothly functioning financial system has removed us from the days of strictly bartering to our system today, where transactions are as simple as a tap on your mobile phone.</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00021">There are any number of professional and personal reasons to study finance. A search of the internet provides a long list of finance-related professions. Interviews with senior managers reveal that an understanding of financial tools and concepts is an important consideration in hiring new employees. Financial skills are among the most important tools for advancement toward greater responsibility and remuneration. Government and work-guaranteed pension benefits are growing less common and less generous, meaning individuals must take greater responsibility for their personal financial well-being now and at retirement. Let&#x2019;s take a closer look at some of the reasons why we study finance.</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00022">There are many career opportunities in the fields of finance. A single course in finance such as this one may pique your interest and encourage you to study more finance-related topics. These studies in turn may qualify you for engaging and high-paying finance careers.

          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00023">A career in finance is just one reason to study finance. Finance is an excellent decision-making tool; it requires analytical thinking. Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing, magnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as well, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or paychecks.</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00024">An understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment opportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real estate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification, and adequate returns. However, in today&#x2019;s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and cryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage of both new and old financial products.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Risk and Return in Finance</h3>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00026">Finance tells us that an increase in risk results in an increase in expected return. The study of historical financial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over time have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise, where&#x2019;s the risk?</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00027">At its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps individuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in our everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or walking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety. Should you buy the required text for your class or instead rely on the professor&#x2019;s notes and the internet? Should you buy that new-to-you used car sight unseen, or should you spend the money for a mechanic to assess the vehicle before you buy? Should you accept your first job offer at graduation or hold out for the offer you really want? A better understanding of finance makes these types of decisions easier and can provide you, as the decision maker, with statistics instead of just intuition.</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00028">Return is compensation for making an investment and waiting for the benefit (see <a href="#auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_fig-00003" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.4</a>). Return could be the interest earned on an investment in a bond or the dividend from the purchase of stock. Return could be the higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education. Individuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the expectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds were the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings account, and that means investors expect a greater average return.</p>
          <p id="auto_562a910a-a933-4baf-a61e-c93ada8891c7_para-00029">The study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-return trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different definitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the characteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar &#x201C;bell-shaped&#x201D; curve you studied in your statistics classes. Understanding a security&#x2019;s average and variability of returns can help us estimate the range and likelihood of higher- or lower-than-expected outcomes. This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate prices that satisfy investors&#x2019; required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or uncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already &#x201C;know.&#x201D;</p>

          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00002">Finance has many functions within an organization, and there are many job titles to reflect the varied job responsibilities.

Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting activities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts receivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and liability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for monitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.</p>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00003">In most organizations, the <span data-type="term" id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_term-00002" group-by="t">treasurer</span> might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the treasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for bankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring loan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also responsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the treasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Financial Planning</h3>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00006">Financial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit. Financial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions required to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners. These could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a &#x201C;mom and pop&#x201D; store, partners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning helps managers understand the firm&#x2019;s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue objectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning process, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans typically consider the firm&#x2019;s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as the development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was thorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial banks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm&#x2019;s expansion.</p>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00007">Good financial planning has a number of common features.</p>

Pro forma income statements are created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income statements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.</li>
            <li>Cash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the timing and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.</li>
            <li>Balance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most important aspects of business is accounting (see <a href="#auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_fig-00001" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.5</a>).</li>

          <h3 data-type="title">Forecasting and Budgeting</h3>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00009">Forecasting and budgeting are common practices for businesses, governmental agencies, not-for-profit firms, and individual households. As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are valuable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of cash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget well before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by developing financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the future. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its objectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and magnitude of expected cash flows.</p>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00010">Financial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify the differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those changes. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that &#x201C;plans are worthless, but planning is everything.&#x201D; That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and government. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps navigate the inevitable detours toward the firm&#x2019;s objectives.</p>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00011">The budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and balance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives and serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to determine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The process should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a periodic renewal and reminder of the firm&#x2019;s goals.</p>
          <p id="auto_f427fa12-21e9-4a81-950e-d9e18221caeb_para-00012">Financial forecasting often starts with the firm&#x2019;s budget and recommends changes based on differences between the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in the immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Importance of Data</h3>
          <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00002">Financial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data leads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the creation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow, and balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders such as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having current and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform managers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to make regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. &#x201C;Gut feelings&#x201D; and &#x201C;seat-of-the-pants&#x201D; decision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.</p>
          <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00003">Outsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory decisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm&#x2019;s financial information. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need data to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should supply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.</p>

          <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00004">Financial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and develop at least three essential financial statements or reports.</p>
          <ol id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_list-00002">
            <li>The income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income statements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.</li>
            <li>Statements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.</li>
            <li>Balance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.</li>
          </ol>
          <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00005">These statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as accumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look forward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.</p>
          <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00006">In addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek external sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market research, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with government officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand, unemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.</p>

The advantages include only paying for the storage actually used, reduced energy consumption, access to specialized data protection services, and software and hardware maintenance. However, the risk of data hacks and the safety of data are key concerns in the storage of digitized information.</p>

              <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00010">Should you lease a new car or buy one? Do you opt for the more expensive high-tech production equipment or reduce your upfront investment and pay higher labor costs over time? Is it better to finance a new product by borrowing money or selling new shares of stock? Should you manufacture overseas where the production costs are lower or in your own country where political and transportation costs are lower? Once you make your choice, how do you know if you&#x2019;ve made the right decision? Understanding and applying financial principles can help.</p>
              <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00011">For example, consider <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_term-00006" group-by="P">Peloton</span>, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In 2012, the principal founder, John <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_term-00007" group-by="F">Foley</span>, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to attend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family. He enjoyed cycling classes, but they could be expensive and often did not fit into his schedule. He recognized that the most popular instructors had developed a bit of a cult following and that the music playlist was a critical component for many followers. His choice of the company name, Peloton, comes from the French word for a &#x201C;pack of bike riders,&#x201D; familiar to anyone who has even loosely followed the annual Tour de France bike race. The company name evokes a measure of mystique and prestige.</p>
              <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00012">Peloton started small and underwent five funding rounds in seven years before the company went public with an initial public offering in September 2019. Foley and his friends had the idea that they were a &#x201C;purposeful music company&#x201D; and needed to touch on all aspects of the workout experience including the bike; video, audio, and music content; clothing design; competition among the riders; data gathering; and instructors for livestream and on-demand classes. They were selling an experience, not a bicycle. The equipment is expensive&#x2014;a Peloton bike typically costs over $2,000. Peloton equips its studios with state-of-the-art camera and music systems and pays its instructors top dollar. Along the way, the founders made several critical financial decisions. They kept control of the firm by using private funding at the start.</p>
              <p id="auto_d4ec8d42-f162-4614-acf3-b0c5942cf7b4_para-00013">How can we tell if Peloton has managed its resources well? The company started with $400,000 of funding to develop a prototype in 2012. By 2018, firm value increased to $4 billion with yet another round of private investor funding. As of April 2021, Peloton is a publicly traded company with a stock value of $34 billion. The executives are sacrificing profits in the short term to generate growth and long-term profitability. The firm uses its financial statements to identify sources and uses of funds, to test the effectiveness of advertising, and to forecast future profitability. Analysts like the firm, the stock price is up, and by many financial measures, Peloton has been a great success. Time will tell if the decisions made over the last several years will lead to long-term profitability or if the company has overinvested in marketing only to miss current and long-term profits.</p>

          <p id="auto_67739711-5c7f-4499-963f-a27a11fb5003_para-00005">Many executive-level finance officers worked their way up via the role of financial analyst. Job descriptions vary across firms, industries, and government organizations. However, the role of financial analyst usually includes market research, financial forecasting, modeling, cost analysis, and comparative valuations. Financial analysts gather data and produce financial reports in conjunction with multiple departments within a business or organization. They rely on marketing and production personnel to provide accurate sales forecasts, and they work with accountants to create accurate financial reports.</p>
          <p id="auto_67739711-5c7f-4499-963f-a27a11fb5003_para-00006">As a financial analyst, you need strong spreadsheet skills, the ability to develop financial models and pro forma financial statements, outstanding analytical skills, and an overall understanding of business processes. Financial analysts possess a well-diversified collection of business and communication skills, both quantitative and qualitative. <a href="#auto_67739711-5c7f-4499-963f-a27a11fb5003_fig-00001" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.6</a> lists some tasks that financial analysts must perform on a daily basis.

Responsibilities include keeping current with market conditions, developing financial models, reconciling variance between forecasts and outcomes, and serving as a resource for management. Financial analysts fulfill their responsibilities through the development and analysis of financial data including ratio analysis, trend analysis, in-depth discussions with division managers, and the presentation and interpretation of information at meetings and on electronic platforms.</p>
          <p id="auto_67739711-5c7f-4499-963f-a27a11fb5003_para-00008">External financial analysts use similar resources and tools to evaluate financial instruments as an aid to investment companies, investment and commercial bankers, and individual investors who rely on their published reports.

However, the strong quantitative skills required for a financial analyst are less emphasized in favor of overall strategic thinking. A successful business analyst is able to evaluate business opportunities by using analytical thinking, industry best practices, process development, team building and organization, and information technology. They then communicate optimal courses of action to executive decision makers to maximize value in alignment with the vision and goals of the firm.</p>
          <p id="auto_67739711-5c7f-4499-963f-a27a11fb5003_para-00011">Business analysts can help develop strategy and tactics to move a firm forward.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies the following as typical business analyst duties:</p>

Think of the primary market as equivalent to the sale of new cars and the secondary market as equivalent to the sale of used cars. In practice, many market locales trade both new and used securities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place among individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies.

However, the information provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by investors of their perceptions of firm&#x2019;s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.</p>

These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows directly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares issued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these new securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary, market transactions.</p>

These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the ongoing liquidity and long-term borrowing needs of the federal government. Again, subsequent trading of this government debt occurs as secondary market transactions.</p>

Instead, dealers attempt to &#x201C;make markets,&#x201D; meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current bid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to generate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price (what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a security).

For instance, a commercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment company pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds. These transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to buy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may create a completely different security all together. For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan created by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely earning interest, and you are not directly affected.</p>

However, occasionally lenders and borrowers are able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale, the process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s, inflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum rates of 5% on their savings deposits.<a href="#auto_99d4fc95-e3b5-4434-a93d-4499a17defb2_foot-00001" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">7</a> Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest directly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities. This lack of deposit funds and the subsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant deregulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.</p>

Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of goods sold.

This information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial forecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on the cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.</p>
          <p id="auto_6a92bcb9-cfcc-4cb4-86d4-2bb80f3d98f8_para-00008">The unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of employers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services. The stock market is a forward-looking macroeconomic variable and measures investor expectations about future cash flows and economic growth. Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect forecasting models.</p>

          <p id="auto_6a92bcb9-cfcc-4cb4-86d4-2bb80f3d98f8_para-00014">In the parable, a group of blind people happen upon an elephant for the first time, and they each touch one part&#x2014;but one part only&#x2014;of the elephant. Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered, the descriptions are vastly different. The group's members become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate descriptions or worse. The parable demonstrates how individuals can make absolute truths from their own limited and subjective information. Financial decision makers run a similar risk, if they choose to recognize only their own findings and ignore other microeconomic or macroeconomic information and the interaction of these factors.</p>
          <p id="auto_6a92bcb9-cfcc-4cb4-86d4-2bb80f3d98f8_para-00015">A common view to understanding economics states that macroeconomics is a top-down approach and microeconomics is a bottom-up approach. Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the individual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective. They need both the macro data, so important for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement. For example, the national rate of unemployment may not have been much help when Bacon Signs was searching for skilled laborers who could form neon signs. However, the unemployment rate helped inform the company about the probability of demand for new businesses and the signs they would need.</p>

          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00003">Financial institutions, corporations, and governments that have short-term borrowing and/or lending needs issue securities in the money market. Most of the transactions are quite large, with typical amounts in excess of $100,000. These large transactions are the norm when trading federal funds, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, or negotiable certificates of deposit. Our sample company, Bacon Signs, was much too small to participate directly in the money market. However, Bacon Signs&#x2019; borrowing rates were affected by changes in the money market. Treasury bills are also a very important component of the money market, and they trade in smaller amounts starting at $10,000 per T-bill.</p>

T-bills are auctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short maturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local income taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt securities. In addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can trade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills has exceeded $75 billion.<a href="#auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_foot-00001" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">9</a></p>

For example, credit card companies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper has a maturity of one to 270 days. The short maturity reduces SEC oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP means that only highly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper. The default rate on commercial paper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range during the financial crisis of 2008.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00006">Commercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount with the face value as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue commercial paper; thus, returns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for CP. Most purchasers are large, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial paper until maturity.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00007"><span data-type="term" id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_term-00005" group-by="N">Negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs)</span> are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are redeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market. NCDs, or <em data-effect="italics">jumbo CDs</em>, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical minimums amounts are $1,000,000 with a maturity of two weeks to six months.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00008">NCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or credit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit insurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount but is much larger than a regular CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to cash out early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher rates on NCDs compared to CDs because they know they will have use of the purchase amount for the entire maturity of the NCD. The reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve are also lower than for other types of deposits.</p>

The federal funds market traditionally consists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial institutions, notably domestic commercial banks. The participants in the market negotiate the federal funds interest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate range in the federal funds market by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market. Many of the borrowing and lending rates in our economy are a direct function of the federal funds rate.</p>

The capital market is similar to the money market.

The Treasury auctions notes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov in the same way they would a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in that they are longer term, pay semiannual coupon interest payments, and pay the par or face value of the note at maturity. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed. However, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally exempt from state and local taxes. There is an active secondary market for Treasury notes.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00013">Longer-term Treasury issues, <span data-type="term" id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_term-00009" group-by="T">Treasury bonds</span>, have maturities of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds are like T-notes in that they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at maturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00014">State and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of <span data-type="term" id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_term-00010" group-by="m">municipal bonds (&#x201C;munis&#x201D;)</span>. Local borrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is unlikely but possible. Thus, munis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to that of corporate bonds in that they receive a bond rating based on the perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest payments are tax-free. Interest on munis is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from state and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00015">Just as governments borrow money in the long-term from investors, so do corporations. A corporation often issues bonds for longer-term financing. Bond contracts identify very specific terms of agreement and outline the rules for the order, timing, and amount of contractual payments, as well as processes for when one or more of the required activities lapse. A bond contract, known as an indenture, includes both standard &#x201C;boilerplate&#x201D; contract language and specific conditions unique to a particular issue. Because of these non-standardized features of a bond contract, the secondary market for trading used bonds typically requires a broker, dealer, or investment company to facilitate a trade.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00016">An important goal of business executives is to maximize the owners&#x2019; wealth. For corporations, shares of stock represent ownership. Stocks are difficult to price compared to bonds. Bonds have contracts that specify the number and amount of all payments made by the firm to the purchasers of bonds. Stock cash flows are far more uncertain than bond cash flows. Stocks might or might not have periodic dividend payments, and an investor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future. However, no contract guarantees the size of the dividends or the time or resale price of the stock. Thus, the cash flows from stock ownership are more uncertain and risky than cash flows from bonds.</p>
          <p id="auto_8f261b0c-509e-4ef0-b580-373554bfa0c6_para-00017">Ownership of corporations is easily transferable if a company&#x2019;s stock trades in one of the organized stock exchanges or in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Most of the trading consists of used or previously issued stocks in the over-the-counter market and organized exchanges. The two largest stock exchanges in the world are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. Both exchanges are located in the United States.</p>

College is expensive, and it is easy to spend every dollar you earn and to borrow to meet the rest of your obligations. Businesses, however, continually make decisions about when and how much money to borrow or invest. Bacon Signs established banking relationships to borrow money when needed to expand the business or a product line. Sometimes the best decision is to invest as soon as possible to grab opportunities, and other times it is better to delay new investment in order to pay dividends to the owners of the company.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Impact of Time on Saving and Spending</h3>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00004">The choice to spend or save and invest is really a choice between consumption today versus consumption in the future. Economists, investment advisers, your friends, and mine love to discuss the trade-off of consumption now or later&#x2014;even if not in those words. We have all heard conversations that go something like this: &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go grab a beer&#x2014;you can study for tomorrow&#x2019;s exam in the morning.&#x201D; Or &#x201C;My father&#x2019;s investment adviser told me that if I invest $500 per month for the next 30 years and earn an annual rate of 10% on my investments, I will have invested $180,000 over time but accumulated an investment portfolio worth over $1.13 million!&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00005">An important aspect of the trade-off between saving and spending involves your short-, intermediate-, and long-term goals. Delaying consumption until later comes with risks. Will your consumption choices still be available? Will the prices be attainable? Will you still be able to consume and enjoy your future purchases?</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00006">When saving for short-term objectives, the safety of the principal invested is important, and the value of compounding returns is minimal compared to longer-term investments. Most short-term investors have a low tolerance for risk and hope to beat the rate of inflation with a little extra besides. An example could be to start a holiday savings account at your local bank as a way to save, earn a small rate of return, and assure that you have funds set aside for consumption at the end of the year.</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00007">An intermediate investment may be to save for a new car or for the down payment on a house or vacation home. Again, maintaining the principal is important, but you have some time to recover from poor investment returns. Intermediate-term investments tend to earn higher average annual rates of return than short-term investments, but they also have greater uncertainty and risk.</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00008">Long-term investments have the advantage of enough time to recover from temporary poor performance and the luxury of compounded returns over a long period. Further, long-term investments tend to have greater risk and higher expected average annual rates of return. Even though this is a business finance text, sometimes a personal finance example is easier to relate to. To illustrate, <a href="#auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_table-00002" class="autogenerated-content">Table 1.2</a> demonstrates four different investment scenarios. In scenario 1, you invest $5,000 annually from ages 26 through 60 into an account earning an average annual rate of return of 10% per year. Over your lifetime, you invest a total of $175,000, and at age 60, you have an estimated portfolio value of $1,490,634. This is a healthy amount that has almost certainly beaten the average annual rate of inflation. In scenario 1, by investing regularly, you accumulate roughly 8.5 times the value of what you invested. Congratulations, you can expect to become a millionaire!</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00009">Compare your results in scenario 1 with your college roommate in scenario 2, who is able to invest $5,000 per year from ages 19 through 25 and leave her investments until age 60 in an account that continues to earn an annual rate of 10%. She makes her investments earlier than yours, but they total only $35,000. However, despite a much smaller investment, her head start advantage and the high average annual compounded rate of return leave her with an expected portfolio value of $1,466,369. Her total is almost as great as the amount you would accumulate, but with a much smaller total investment.</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00010">Scenarios 3 and 4 are even more dramatic, as can be seen from a review of <a href="#auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_table-00002" class="autogenerated-content">Table 1.2</a>. In both scenarios, only five $5,000 investments are made, but they are made earlier in the investor&#x2019;s life. Parents or grandparents could make these investments on behalf of the recipients. In both scenarios, the portfolios grow to amounts greater than those of you or your roommate with smaller total investments. The common factor is that greater time leads to additional compounding of the investments and thus greater future values.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Definition of Economic Value</h3>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00011"><em data-effect="italics">Value</em> is a term used frequently in business and especially in economics, accounting, and finance. Accountants track, record, and display value in the form of financial statements and footnotes. The numbers they present are &#x201C;book values&#x201D; and represent what has occurred. Financial people like to speak in terms of &#x201C;market values.&#x201D; Market values are calculated using expected future cash flows discounted to today. Market values are the prices that consumers pay for a product. <span data-type="term" id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_term-00003" group-by="E">Economic value</span> is what we believe consumers are actually willing to pay for a product, service, or experience. For example, the price of a movie ticket may be $10, but there are individuals who are willing to pay far more for the experience of watching a movie on the big screen.</p>
          <p id="auto_e13bfaff-5e45-44e5-ad28-997db0a6267c_para-00012">Generally, the economic value is at least as great as the market value or current price of an asset. When Bacon Signs planned for the future, the firm attempted to determine the economic value of its products when creating an optimal mix of price and quantity sold. Firms that produce unique products for clients may have multiple prices based on the estimated economic value of their good or service to the client. One way to think about the difference between market value and economic value is that market value is what you have to pay, while economic value is what you are willing to pay.</p>

            </h2>
            <p id="auto_542954cb-a7a9-4301-a523-d2e798b196db_para-00001">When someone opens a business, it is because they want to fulfill important personal financial goals. In publicly traded companies, managers and employees work on behalf of the shareholders, who own the business through their ownership of company stock. These managers and employees have an ongoing obligation to pursue projects, policies, and corporate investments that will increase or promote stockholder value over the long term. Although many companies focus on financially related goals, such as growth, earnings per share, and market share, the main financial goal is to create value for investors.</p>
            <p id="auto_542954cb-a7a9-4301-a523-d2e798b196db_para-00002">Keep in mind that a company&#x2019;s stockholders are not just an abstract group. Like the sole business owner, they are individuals who have chosen to invest their hard-earned cash in a company. They are looking for a return on their investment in order to meet their own personal long-term financial goals, which might be saving for retirement, a new home, or college education for their children.</p>
            <p id="auto_542954cb-a7a9-4301-a523-d2e798b196db_para-00003">In addition to increasing value, it is also important to realize that a firm has important nonfinancial goals. Some examples of these might include the following:</p>
            <ul id="auto_542954cb-a7a9-4301-a523-d2e798b196db_list-00001">
              <li>Expanding sales to existing customers</li>
              <li>Increasing customer loyalty to the weaker brands</li>
              <li>Developing new products for current and potential customers</li>
              <li>Becoming international by setting up an online ordering service</li>
              <li>Improving customer satisfaction with customer services</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="auto_542954cb-a7a9-4301-a523-d2e798b196db_para-00004">If managers are to help stockholders maximize their wealth, they must know how that wealth is determined in the first place. One of the main concepts in finance is that the value of any asset is determined by the present value of the stream of cash flows that the asset will provide to its owners over the course of time. In subsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are based on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.</p>
            <p id="auto_542954cb-a7a9-4301-a523-d2e798b196db_para-00005">For these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires us to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that affect a company&#x2019;s value may not immediately be reflected in the price of a company&#x2019;s stock but rather will become evident in the long-term prospects of the organization.</p>
            <p id="auto_542954cb-a7a9-4301-a523-d2e798b196db_para-00006">In the case of privately held companies, smaller firms, and sole proprietorships, there are no shareholders. However, attention to long-term growth and maximizing the value of a firm is just as important a goal to the owners, who are also usually senior management with the company.</p>

          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00002">The functions of most executive management teams are very similar for most businesses, and they will not differ in any significant manner based on how they may be structured or organized. However, the legal structure of any company will have a substantial impact on its operations, and it therefore deserves a significant amount of analysis and discussion. The four most common forms of business organizations are the following:</p>
          <ol id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_list-00002">
            <li>Sole proprietorships</li>
            <li>Partnerships</li>

            <li>Hybrids, such as limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs)</li>

          <h3 data-type="title">Sole Proprietorships</h3>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00004">A proprietorship is typically defined as an unincorporated business owned by a single person. The process of forming a business as a <span data-type="term" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00002" group-by="s">sole proprietor</span> is usually a simple matter. A business owner merely decides to begin conducting business operations, and that person is immediately off and running. Compared to other forms of business organizations, proprietorships have the following four important advantages:</p>
          <ol id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_list-00003">
            <li>They have a basic structure and are simple and inexpensive to form.</li>
            <li>They are subject to relatively few government rules and regulations.</li>
            <li>Taxation on sole proprietorships is far simpler than on other organizational forms. There are no separate taxes associated with a sole proprietorship, as there are with corporations. Sole proprietors simply report all their business income and losses on their personal income tax returns.</li>
            <li>Controlling responsibilities of the firm are not divided in any way. This results in less complicated managerial decisions and improved timeliness of necessary corrective actions.</li>
          </ol>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00005">However, despite the ease of their formation and these stated advantages, proprietorships have four notable shortcomings:</p>
          <ol id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_list-00004">
            <li>A sole proprietor has unlimited personal liability for any financial obligations or business debts, so in the end, they risk incurring greater financial losses than the total amount of money they originally invested in the company&#x2019;s formation. As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of $5,000 to start their business. Now, let&#x2019;s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering this business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the sole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance coverage the business might have).</li>
            <li>Unlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also, if the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional <span data-type="term" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00003" group-by="i">investor</span>(s) might demand a change in the organizational structure of the business.</li>
            <li>Because of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of financing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small businesses.</li>
            <li>A sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as finance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs associated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.</li>
          </ol>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00006">It is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into corporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to outweigh the advantages.</p>

In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole proprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.</p>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00008">Partnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners may have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to superior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital to a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.</p>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00009">A partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm&#x2019;s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the partners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income tax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability, which means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of the firm&#x2019;s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.</p>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00010">For this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing potential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the company. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to raise large amounts of capital.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Corporations</h3>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00011">The most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a legal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly from its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that limits stockholders&#x2019; losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can lose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the company.</p>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00012">Unlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to transfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one&#x2019;s interest in an unincorporated business. These factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses. Many companies, such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00005" group-by="M">Microsoft</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00006" group-by="H">Hewlett-Packard</span>, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships, but at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in size and complexity.</p>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00013">An important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United States are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation&#x2019;s earnings are taxed; then, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to <span data-type="term" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00007" group-by="s">shareholders (stockholders)</span>, those earnings are taxed again as personal income.</p>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00014">It is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the <span data-type="term" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00008" group-by="S">S corporation</span>, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were proprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S corporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for relatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is often referred to as a <span data-type="term" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00009" group-by="C">C corporation</span>. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This structure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow and they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually become C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller businesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger companies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Hybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships</h3>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00015">Another form of business organization is the <span data-type="term" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00010" group-by="l">limited liability corporation (LLC)</span>. This type of business structure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a <span data-type="term" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00011" group-by="h">hybrid form of business</span> that has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is something called a <span data-type="term" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00012" group-by="l">limited liability partnership (LLP)</span>, which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in use. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in such fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of businesses.</p>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00016">Similar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability protection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general partner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct proportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment.</p>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00017">A particular advantage of a limited liability partnership is that it allows some of the partners in a firm to limit their liability. Under such a structure, only designated partners have unlimited liability for company debts; other partners can be designated as limited partners, only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution. Limited partners are typically not active decision makers within the firm.</p>

          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00019">LLCs and LLPs have gained great popularity in recent years, but larger companies still find substantial advantages in being structured as C corporations. This is primarily due to the benefits of raising capital to support long-term growth. It is interesting to note that LLC and LLP organizational structures were essentially devised by attorneys. They generally are rather complicated, and the legal protection offered to their ownership principals may vary from state to state. For these reasons, it is usually necessary to retain a knowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.</p>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00020">Obviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages and disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a corporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of funding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such organizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than relatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations. This follows from the idea that limited ownership liability reduces the overall risks borne by investors. All other things being equal, the lower a firm&#x2019;s risk, the higher its value.</p>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00021">Growth opportunities will also have a tremendous impact on the overall value of a business. Because corporations can raise financing more easily than most other types of organizations, they are better able to engage in profitable projects, make investments, and otherwise take superior advantage of their many favorable growth opportunities.</p>
          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00022">The value of any asset will, to a large degree, depend on its liquidity. <em data-effect="italics"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00013" group-by="L">Liquidity</span></em> refers to asset characteristics that enable the asset to be sold or otherwise converted into cash in a relatively short period of time and with minimal effort to attain fair market value for the owner. Because ownership of corporate stock is far easier to transfer to a potential buyer than is any interest in a business proprietorship or partnership, and because most investors are more willing to invest their funds in stocks than they are in partnerships that may carry unlimited liability, an investment in corporate stock will remain relatively liquid. This, too, is an advantage of a corporation and is another factor that enhances its value.</p>

          <p id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_para-00024">Many business owners decide to structure their business as a corporation. In order to begin the process of incorporation, an organization must file a business registration form with the US state in which it will be based and carry on its primary business activities. The document that must be used for this application is generally referred to as the <span data-type="term" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00015" group-by="a">articles of incorporation</span> or a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_8202b6cd-702f-45be-9b14-5012a0a81b3d_term-00016" group-by="c">corporate charter</span>.

Stakeholders include employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities, and governments. Different stakeholders have different priorities, and companies often have to make compromises to please as many stakeholders as possible.</p>

          <p id="auto_039528dc-2747-4d14-95fb-e8a12efcf9d2_para-00003">A shareholder or stockholder can be a person, company, or organization that holds stock in a given company. Shareholders typically receive dividends if the company does well and succeeds. They are entitled to vote on certain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a shareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company&#x2019;s financial obligations or debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company&#x2019;s directors, deciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors&#x2019; power, and monitoring and approving the company&#x2019;s financial statements.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">Types of Shareholders</h4>
            <p id="auto_039528dc-2747-4d14-95fb-e8a12efcf9d2_para-00004">There are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common shareholders are any persons who own a company&#x2019;s common stock. They have the right to control how the company is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that could potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company&#x2019;s preferred stock and have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of annual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid. Though both common shareholders and preferred shareholders see their stock value increase with the positive performance of the company, common shareholders experience higher capital gains and losses.</p>
            <p id="auto_039528dc-2747-4d14-95fb-e8a12efcf9d2_para-00005">Shareholders and directors are two different entities, although a director can also be shareholder. The shareholder, as already mentioned, is a part owner of the company. A director, on the other hand, is the person hired by the shareholders to perform oversight and provide strategic policy direction to company management.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">The Differences between a Shareholder and a Stakeholder</h4>
            <p id="auto_039528dc-2747-4d14-95fb-e8a12efcf9d2_para-00006">The terms <em data-effect="italics">shareholder</em> and <em data-effect="italics">stakeholder</em> mean different things. A shareholder is an owner of a company because of the shares of stock they own. Stakeholders may not own part of the company, but they are in many ways equally dependent on the performance of the company. However, their concerns may not be financial. For example, a chain of hotels in the United States that employs thousands of people has several classes of stakeholders, including employees who rely on the company for their jobs and local and national governments that depend on the taxes the company pays.</p>
            <p id="auto_039528dc-2747-4d14-95fb-e8a12efcf9d2_para-00007">Before a company becomes public, it is a private company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of people called <em data-effect="italics">subscribers</em>.

          <h3 data-type="title">Role of Management</h3>
          <p id="auto_039528dc-2747-4d14-95fb-e8a12efcf9d2_para-00008">Corporations are run at the highest level by a group of senior managers referred to as the board of directors (BOD). The BOD is ultimately responsible for providing oversight and strategic direction as well as overall supervision of the organization at its highest managerial level. From an operational standpoint, the practical day-to-day management of a company comprises of a team of several mid-level managers, who are responsible for providing leadership to various departments in the company. Such managers may often have different functional roles in a business organization. The primary roles of any management group involve setting the objectives of the company; organizing operations; hiring, leading, and motivating employees; and overseeing operations to ensure that company goals are continually being met.</p>
          <p id="auto_039528dc-2747-4d14-95fb-e8a12efcf9d2_para-00009">It is also important that managers have a long-term focus on meeting growth targets and corporate objectives. Unfortunately, there have been many examples of companies where the managerial focus was shifted to short-term goals&#x2014;quarterly or fiscal year earnings estimates or the current price of the company stock&#x2014;for personal reasons, such as increased bonuses and financial benefits. Such short-term thinking is often not in the best interest of the long-term health and objectives of companies or their shareholders.</p>

Every public company is legally required to install a board of directors. Nonprofit organizations and many private companies often establish a board of directors as well, even if they are not legally required to do so.</p>
          <p id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_para-00003">The board is responsible for protecting shareholders&#x2019; interests, establishing management policies, overseeing the corporation or organization, and making decisions about important issues. The board of directors acts as a fiduciary for shareholders. The board is also tasked with a number of other responsibilities, including setting company goals, creating dividend and stock option policies, hiring and firing chief executive officers (CEOs), and ensuring that the company has the resources it needs to perform well.</p>

            <p id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_para-00004">The bylaws of a company or organization determine the structure, responsibilities, and powers given to a board of directors. The bylaws also determine how many board members there are, how the members are elected, and how frequently the board members meet.</p>
            <p id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_para-00005">The board must represent shareholder and management interests, so it is best for the board to include both internal and external members. Usually, there is an internal director and an external director. The internal director is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the interests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who function outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company&#x2019;s board of directors.</p>

            <p id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_para-00006">The structure of a board of directors varies more outside of the United States. In Asia and the European Union, there are commonly executive and supervisory boards. The executive board is made up of company insiders who are elected by employees and shareholders. In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company CEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a typical US board of directors. The chair of the board varies, but the board is always led by someone other than the prominent executive officer.</p>

The AC is formed by the board of directors as a separately chartered subcommittee of the board of directors. It reports regularly to the BOD and assists the board by assuming responsibilities for critical corporate financial matters, such as reviewing audit plans and findings, approving external public accountants, and coordinating the efforts of both internal and external financial reviews and audits. The audit committee provides expertise in all financial and accounting matters for a company, and it is therefore a critical part of a company&#x2019;s corporate governance efforts.</p>

Due to this increase in importance and recognition, several boards have shifted some of the audit committee&#x2019;s responsibilities to separately chartered committees in order to create a balance of duties and ensure that those duties are effectively focused on and efficiently executed. Some of these additional committees have been known to include a compensation committee, a disclosure committee, and a governance committee, and they all have related objectives that need to be documented within the charter of each of the individual committees. It is important for the different committees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its responsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.</p>
            <p id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_para-00018">The audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization&#x2019;s corporate governance process and to communicate any recommendations for changes. The audit committee will usually follow up and monitor the process put in place to implement any changes or necessary improvements. As with any other corporate function, the audit committee&#x2019;s role is greatly affected by the legal, institutional, financial, cultural, and political circumstances that impact the company.</p>

            <p id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_para-00019">It is crucial to today&#x2019;s corporate environment that firms do not lose sight of achieving and maintaining strong and efficient oversight and governance. This is true despite the litany of other important items on the busy agendas of most boards.</p>
            <p id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_para-00020">Keeping a focus on the critical ethics of management, as well as the traditional focus on the importance of ethics to the overall organization, is not only timely in this day and age but also sound business practice. The importance of establishing a comprehensive system of checks and balances cannot be overemphasized. Beginning with the chief executive officer, these checks and balances need to progress through senior management, and they ultimately include the board of directors itself. Similar checks and balances need to then filter down though the rest of the entire firm. By taking the appropriate steps to improve corporate oversight and governance, overall business risk can be mitigated and future operational problems reduced. Additionally, such steps can lead to the positive effects of achieving sustainable operational and financial benefits for a company and its shareholders.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">The Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors</h3>
          <p id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_para-00022">An independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company other than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the company for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on information provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best practice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held companies.</p>
          <p id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_para-00023">In most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_term-00015" group-by="c">conflicts of interest</span>. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a partnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such an instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear that it would lead to potential conflict.</p>
          <p id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_para-00024">A board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">The Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors</h3>
          <p id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_para-00025">As mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors. Increasingly over recent years, corporate management has begun to appreciate the value of diversity in boards of directors. This has resulted in a significant increase in the total number of women and minorities in boardrooms in the United States. However, many business observers believe that corporate governance practices have a long way to go in this respect. Increasing representation has now grown to become a high priority for most businesses and organizations around the world.</p>
          <p id="auto_31426484-06a6-4f12-8930-1b1dc5bb6ed8_para-00026">Board members face many challenges in making decisions effectively and efficiently as possible. Because of such challenges, the potential objective of diversifying the boardroom competes with other worthy topics and objectives such as improving cybersecurity, advancing customer service, identifying and reducing risk, improving community relations, and positioning strategically within an industry. This has left corporate governance experts and researchers in a situation where they find themselves &#x201C;playing catch-up&#x201D; to adequately diversify.</p>

As with most problematic issues in business, agency problems can be resolved, but only if organizations are willing to take the appropriate steps to resolve them.</p>
          <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00004">Every company has its own set of goals and objectives, but it is important to note that the employee and personal goals of managers may differ and may not align with the goals and objectives of stockholders (ownership). Because these differences exist, and because all parties have a desire to maximize their own wealth, agency problems can often arise, having a negative impact on company profits, stock price, and the goodwill of the shareholder base.</p>
          <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00005">There are three primary types of agency problems, discussed below.</p>

This was to increase earnings and, ultimately, their own personal wealth through an uptick in stock price. However, as a result of this unnecessary rise in the price of the shampoo, customers were disappointed, and a majority of them wound up boycotting the product. Additionally, some of the consumers who continued to purchase the product noticed a decline in the overall quality of the shampoo and were also very disappointed. In this scenario, agency problems surfaced between stockholders and loyal customers of the company.</p>

Doing so will usually not have any effects on normal business operations. At the same time, the company can employ different experts and professionals to manage key operations of the business.</p>
            <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00009">However, a drawback to this is that hiring outsiders may eventually become troublesome for shareholders. External managers who are brought into a company may end up making self-serving decisions or even misusing company funds. This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share prices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.</p>

In the end, if these riskier projects end up failing and the company loses money, investors (bondholders) may also experience financial risk as bonds go into default or otherwise lose market value. This then becomes a potential agency problem between bondholders (investors) and creditors.</p>

            <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00013">Situations may arise in which stockholders of a firm find themselves in conflicts of interest with other stakeholders of the company. For example, employees of a firm might be asking for a general wage increase. If such a wage increase were voted down by stockholders, this could result in key employees departing the organization, eventually leading to poorer business results and the dissatisfaction of other stakeholders in the company as company profits decline. In such an example, we see the agency problem of stockholders versus other stakeholders.</p>

However, the most important factor leading to the company&#x2019;s failure was the actions of Steven Heyer, who was a friend of the new owners and had been hired as CEO. Heyer, who was awarded an exorbitant executive salary, was also allowed to sink the company into further debt. Harry &amp; David has since emerged from bankruptcy under new leadership. But this example should serve as a cautionary tale of what can happen when stockholders are able to put their interests ahead of those of other stakeholders in a corporate environment.</p>

Despite being a multibillion-dollar company, Enron began losing money in 1997. It had also started incurring a tremendous amount of debt. Fearing a drop in stock prices, Enron&#x2019;s management team tried to disguise the problems by misrepresenting them through inappropriate accounting methods, which resulted in confusing and misleading financial statements.</p>

The company filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, and criminal charges were brought against several key Enron employees, including former CEO Kenneth Lay and former CFO Andrew Fastow.

The cash losses of Madoff&#x2019;s scheme were recently estimated to be between $17 billion and $20 billion. The returns he promised were higher than what most investment firms and banks were offering&#x2014;so promising that almost all of his investors ignored any concerns they may have had and basically looked the other way. Madoff paid for any redemption requests with money that had been newly invested.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">How to Resolve Agency Problems</h3>
          <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00025">Ultimately, agency problems result from the differences among the interests of a company&#x2019;s management, other stakeholders of the firm, and its ownership or stockholders. When perpetuated, these differences may eventually result in lasting conflicts of interest. In order for companies to avoid such problems, it is imperative that they address the underlying problems of these differences. This will help ensure that normal business operations are not being adversely impacted by the agency problem.</p>
          <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00026">While there is no surefire way to resolve all conflicts of interest and agency problems, some measures that can help mitigate such issues include the following:</p>
          <ul id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_list-00002">
            <li>Offering incentives to management for strong performance and ethical behavior</li>
            <li>Awarding decision makers with stock packages, commissions, and other long-term compensation packages to encourage long-term thinking and matching of company objectives with shareholders&#x2019; priorities</li>
            <li>Penalizing poor performance, shortsightedness, and unethical behavior</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00027">The prevailing belief in agency theory is that when a business creates organizational incentives that encourage hard work on projects that will benefit the company in both the short and long term, more employees will be encouraged to act in the business&#x2019;s best interest.</p>
          <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00028">Another means of resolving agency problems is through a hostile takeover of the organization. Even the threat of such a takeover may be effective in reducing or eliminating these conflicts of interest. A hostile corporate takeover tends to unify and discipline a management or agent group, thus fostering a union of agent and shareholder interests. When such a potential threat or outright ownership change is introduced to a company, its managers are more likely to act in the best long-term interests of the shareholders in order to maintain their leadership positions within the company.</p>
          <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00029">By better aligning <em data-effect="italics">agent</em> (management) and <em data-effect="italics">principal</em> (ownership) goals, agency theory attempts to bridge any gulfs among employees, employers, and stakeholders that are created by the principal-agent problem. While it is recognized as being nearly impossible for companies to eliminate the ongoing agency problem, it is also recognized that it is possible to minimize its negative effects.</p>

          <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00030">In recent years, many publicly traded companies, as well as many that are privately owned, are being evaluated and rated according to environmental, social, and governance <span data-type="term" id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_term-00008" group-by="Symbols">(ESG)</span> factors. These ratings and evaluations are primarily conducted by third-party organizations. As a result, the investment community is using these reports and ratings to an ever-increasing degree in order to measure and assess corporate ESG factors and performance.</p>
          <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00031">Environmental, social, and governance issues have become an important part of the investment community&#x2019;s evaluation of publicly traded companies. Each component of what is now referred to as ESG has equal importance in ongoing corporate evaluations, as per <a href="#auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_fig-00001" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.3</a> below. It is critical for the senior management of any corporation to stay abreast of any and all ESG issues as they arise and take immediate corrective action when necessary.</p>

          <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00032">ESG measurements and assessments have become very important to firms, as they often become the basis of formal and informal buy recommendations by investment professionals. ESG ratings were originally developed to assist in determining the general risk of ESG factors for any public company, but they have since grown to become unique scores used by investors to gauge the potential attractiveness of investment in the subject company. Because of the nature of these factors, firms that are rated with high ESG metrics are believed to represent superior investments and to have proactive management teams focused on creating long-term value of company stock.</p>
          <p id="auto_65b9a0f7-778f-4b84-b31e-834d3bf9fb9a_para-00033">Thus, with investors increasingly using ESG scores to form their investment strategies, the consequences of a poor rating can have a negative impact on a firm&#x2019;s share price and result in substantial problems. In any case, it is important to note that ESG is only a starting point from which it is possible to gather indicators on a business and its direction. In the end, it does not present the entire story of a firm. Any investment decisions about the company in question should include a significant amount of additional data.</p>

          <p id="auto_647e51dc-2ce3-49ff-a30a-0451a6180e41_para-00002">Within the general field of corporate public relations is a specific subdivision referred to as <span data-type="term" id="auto_647e51dc-2ce3-49ff-a30a-0451a6180e41_term-00001" group-by="i">investor relations (IR)</span>. IR involves elements of communication, marketing, and finance and is designed to control the flow of information from the management of a public corporation to its investors and stakeholders.</p>
          <p id="auto_647e51dc-2ce3-49ff-a30a-0451a6180e41_para-00003">Because the investment community plays such a critical role in the overall growth and success of any corporation, it is imperative that firms maintain strong and open relationships with their shareholder or potential investor audience. IR was developed to take responsibility for achieving and maintaining these crucial relationships.</p>
          <p id="auto_647e51dc-2ce3-49ff-a30a-0451a6180e41_para-00004">Investor relations are quite different from typical public relations practices. A firm&#x2019;s IR group must work very closely with the accounting and legal departments, as well as with members of the senior management team, such as the CEO and CFO.</p>
          <p id="auto_647e51dc-2ce3-49ff-a30a-0451a6180e41_para-00005">As might be expected, IR has far more regulatory obligations than standard public relations functions, largely due to corporate reporting requirements enforced by the SEC and the <span data-type="term" id="auto_647e51dc-2ce3-49ff-a30a-0451a6180e41_term-00002" group-by="I">International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)</span>. IR became significantly more important in 2002, when the United States Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), also known as the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act. This legislation resulted in requirements that dramatically increased the extent of financial reporting for any publicly traded company. SOX was enacted in an attempt to prevent the occurrence of corporate financial scandals such as the one notoriously committed by the Enron Corporation that we discussed earlier.</p>

Quarterly 10-Qs are an ongoing and regular reporting requirement of publicly traded companies and are to be filed within 45 days following the end of each fiscal quarter.</p>
          <p id="auto_647e51dc-2ce3-49ff-a30a-0451a6180e41_para-00009">Depending on a company&#x2019;s size and the complexity of its operation, a firm is likely to issue an earnings <span data-type="term" id="auto_647e51dc-2ce3-49ff-a30a-0451a6180e41_term-00007" group-by="p">press release</span> and conduct a <span data-type="term" id="auto_647e51dc-2ce3-49ff-a30a-0451a6180e41_term-00008" group-by="c">conference call</span> with the investment community within this same 45-day period.

          <p id="auto_647e51dc-2ce3-49ff-a30a-0451a6180e41_para-00010">It is important for companies to do their planning and not enter a quarterly earnings conference call unprepared. There is a multitude of available resources for companies to analyze and review in preparation. Among such resources are industry reports prepared by government agencies; the financial reports and earnings calls of competing organizations, both within and outside of a company&#x2019;s primary industry; and financial research reports prepared by various covering analysts, who follow the specific company and are employed by financial brokerage firms.</p>

It is important to reach shareholders and investors on an almost personal basis by crafting a successful and interesting investment story. For effective investor relations, key messages supporting any ownership or potential investment case should be clear and consistent. These key messages should be embedded within the company&#x2019;s materials and should form the basis of presentations, the corporate website, and annual reports.

By targeting the ownership and potential investing audience, senior executives can make the best use of their time and improve their interactions with the investing public during these events. If smaller companies outsource the investor meeting planning process, the third-party firm should be thoroughly grounded in the client&#x2019;s corporate culture.</p>
          <p id="auto_647e51dc-2ce3-49ff-a30a-0451a6180e41_para-00013">The most productive investor and shareholder meetings begin with a strong, understandable corporate introduction and continue by delivering an engaging story that demonstrates the company&#x2019;s successes, a track record of growth, and the high probability of favorable future prospects. Additionally, it is important for a company&#x2019;s senior management to end any meeting with feedback from the investor audience and set timelines for follow-up. There will always be times when something unexpected may happen and the addition of information or impromptu changes to scheduled agendas may occur. It is at times like these when understanding the body language and facial expressions of an audience can be critical in producing a favorable outcome of the meeting.</p>

Whether to release financial information, unveil new products or services, announce changes in management, or a host of other reasons, all communications have a different objective. Not all press releases are created equally, and they have varying degrees of effectiveness. Any press release should contain information in easy-to-understand language that is free of corporate jargon and as concise as possible. Press releases may be viewed by multiple audiences, such as customers, stakeholders, investors, potential investors, and the general public, which is vital to consider when drafting a press release.</p>

Quotes from senior management can provide valuable insight, but they should not provide any new information; they should simply extend or expand on a subject already mentioned and further back up a claim.</p>

          <p id="auto_b81b0c54-4415-4080-8fce-cad4b9393690_para-00002">If a company becomes global or multinational in scope, fundamental analysis of the organization by the investment community can become more complex. In order to better understand a company, it is important to determine what laws affect the company&#x2019;s governance process and which set of accounting rules is used to fashion its financial reports.</p>
          <p id="auto_b81b0c54-4415-4080-8fce-cad4b9393690_para-00003">Domestic companies operate completely or for the most part within the borders of the United States. While such organizations may import raw materials and supplies from other nations or end up exporting their finished products to other countries around the world, in the end, these international activities represent only a very small portion of their overall business activities.</p>
          <p id="auto_b81b0c54-4415-4080-8fce-cad4b9393690_para-00004">Domestic companies are typically governed by US accounting and securities laws that have been established by the SEC. Further, financial reporting for these domestic organizations is to be completed using <span data-type="term" id="auto_b81b0c54-4415-4080-8fce-cad4b9393690_term-00001" group-by="G">Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)</span>.</p>
          <p id="auto_b81b0c54-4415-4080-8fce-cad4b9393690_para-00005">International firms, while based in the United States, will typically maintain significant levels of international investment and conduct operations that may be quite diverse, both geographically and culturally. For such international firms, parent company accounting will usually adhere to GAAP standards. Conversely, non-US subsidiaries of such international firms may be regulated by laws dictated by their host countries. These will often differ significantly from those in the United States.</p>
          <p id="auto_b81b0c54-4415-4080-8fce-cad4b9393690_para-00006">In recent years, accounting regulations in countries outside the United States have come under the jurisdiction of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_b81b0c54-4415-4080-8fce-cad4b9393690_term-00002" group-by="I">International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)</span>. It should be noted that guidelines and regulations under IFRS and those under GAAP can differ significantly. As a result of these regulatory differences, any specific divergences in accounting or governance practices between foreign subsidiaries and a US parent company should be clearly stated and disclosed in the parent company&#x2019;s financial reports.</p>
          <p id="auto_b81b0c54-4415-4080-8fce-cad4b9393690_para-00007">Global firms have substantial operations and investments in different countries (<span data-type="term" id="auto_b81b0c54-4415-4080-8fce-cad4b9393690_term-00003" group-by="g">global markets</span>), and they may have no single center or basis of operational activity. In such cases, regulations for corporate governance are usually determined by the laws of the country in which the parent company has been established. While there are some global firms that report their financial statements according to GAAP standards, usually to satisfy the informational needs of US investors, most global parent companies&#x2019; financials will adhere to IFRS reporting standards.</p>
