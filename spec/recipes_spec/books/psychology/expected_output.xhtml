While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend&#x2019;s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the <em data-effect="italics">New York Times</em> contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O&#x2019;Connor &amp; Robertson, 2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie <em data-effect="italics">A Beautiful Mind</em>. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain&#x2019;s internal processes and people&#x2019;s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.</p>

To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.</p>
        <p id="auto_7b83ef15-2214-44fe-85cb-912ed21c75bc_fs-idm210880">Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.</p>
        <p id="auto_7b83ef15-2214-44fe-85cb-912ed21c75bc_zip-idm377205280">In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_7b83ef15-2214-44fe-85cb-912ed21c75bc_term2" group-by="e">empirical method</span> for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.</p>
        <p id="auto_7b83ef15-2214-44fe-85cb-912ed21c75bc_fs-idm5396064">It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?</h3>
          <p id="auto_7b83ef15-2214-44fe-85cb-912ed21c75bc_fs-idm4895472">Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson &amp; Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook&#x2019;s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).</p>
          <p id="auto_7b83ef15-2214-44fe-85cb-912ed21c75bc_fs-idm625424">An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of information&#x2014;assessing its reliability and usefulness&#x2014; is an important skill in a world full of competing &#x201C;facts,&#x201D; many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase students&#x2019; scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they encounter.</p>
          <p id="auto_7b83ef15-2214-44fe-85cb-912ed21c75bc_fs-idm706016">In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that shape one&#x2019;s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).</p>

        <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm48059152">Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.</p>

His famous book entitled <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Physiological Psychology</em> was published in 1873. Wundt viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious experience. Wundt used <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_term4" group-by="i">introspection</span> (he called it &#x201C;internal perception&#x201D;), a process by which someone examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism&#x2014;that people have free will and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980). Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured reaction time. He also wrote <em data-effect="italics">Volkerpsychologie</em> in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to develop <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_term5" group-by="s">structuralism</span>. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &amp; Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (<a href="#auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_CNX_Psych_01_02_Wundt" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.2</a>). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or sound. The subject&#x2019;s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas &amp; Ferrand, 1999).</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Functionalism</h3>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idp35147312">William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (<a href="#auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_CNX_Psych_01_02_James" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.3</a>). They accepted Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an organism&#x2019;s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James saw it, psychology&#x2019;s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective was known as <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_term6" group-by="f">functionalism</span>. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices, and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).</p>

Freud (1856&#x2013;1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from &#x201C;hysteria&#x201D; and neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of symptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical cause. Freud theorized that many of his patients&#x2019; problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud&#x2019;s view, the unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access to the unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient&#x2019;s problems. According to Freud, the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came to people&#x2019;s minds, and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_term8" group-by="P">Psychoanalytic theory</span> focuses on the role of a person&#x2019;s unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspective dominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005).</p>

          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm50839632">Freud&#x2019;s ideas were influential, and you will learn more about them when you study lifespan development, personality, and therapy. For instance, many therapists believe strongly in the unconscious and the impact of early childhood experiences on the rest of a person&#x2019;s life. The method of psychoanalysis, which involves the patient talking about their experiences and selves, while not invented by Freud, was certainly popularized by him and is still used today. Many of Freud&#x2019;s other ideas, however, are controversial. Drew Westen (1998) argues that many of the criticisms of Freud&#x2019;s ideas are misplaced, in that they attack his older ideas without taking into account later writings. Westen also argues that critics fail to consider the success of the broad ideas that Freud introduced or developed, such as the importance of childhood experiences in adult motivations, the role of unconscious versus conscious motivations in driving our behavior, the fact that motivations can cause conflicts that affect behavior, the effects of mental representations of ourselves and others in guiding our interactions, and the development of personality over time. Westen identifies subsequent research support for all of these ideas.</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm2800432">More modern iterations of Freud&#x2019;s clinical approach have been empirically demonstrated to be effective (Knekt et al., 2008; Shedler, 2010). Some current practices in psychotherapy involve examining unconscious aspects of the self and relationships, often through the relationship between the therapist and the client. Freud&#x2019;s historical significance and contributions to clinical practice merit his inclusion in a discussion of the historical movements within psychology.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Wertheimer, Koffka, K&#xF6;hler, and Gestalt Psychology</h3>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idp12734720">Max Wertheimer (1880&#x2013;1943), Kurt Koffka (1886&#x2013;1941), and Wolfgang K&#xF6;hler (1887&#x2013;1967) were three German psychologists who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century to escape Nazi Germany. These scholars are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles. The word <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_term9" group-by="G">Gestalt</span> roughly translates to &#x201C;whole;&#x201D; a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts, how those parts relate to each other as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception. For example, a song may be made up of individual notes played by different instruments, but the real nature of the song is perceived in the combinations of these notes as they form the melody, rhythm, and harmony. In many ways, this particular perspective would have directly contradicted Wundt&#x2019;s ideas of structuralism (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005).</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm75121728">Unfortunately, in moving to the United States, these scientists were forced to abandon much of their work and were unable to continue to conduct research on a large scale. These factors along with the rise of behaviorism (described next) in the United States prevented principles of Gestalt psychology from being as influential in the United States as they had been in their native Germany (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005). Despite these issues, several Gestalt principles are still very influential today. Considering the human individual as a whole rather than as a sum of individually measured parts became an important foundation in humanistic theory late in the century. The ideas of Gestalt have continued to influence research on sensation and perception.</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm123393392">Structuralism, Freud, and the Gestalt psychologists were all concerned in one way or another with describing and understanding inner experience. But other researchers had concerns that inner experience could be a legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and chose instead to exclusively study behavior, the objectively observable outcome of mental processes.</p>

Pavlov studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex, in which an animal or human produced a reflex (unconscious) response to a stimulus and, over time, was conditioned to produce the response to a different stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus. The reflex Pavlov worked with was salivation in response to the presence of food. The salivation reflex could be elicited using a second stimulus, such as a specific sound, that was presented in association with the initial food stimulus several times. Once the response to the second stimulus was &#x201C;learned,&#x201D; the food stimulus could be omitted. Pavlov&#x2019;s &#x201C;classical conditioning&#x201D; is only one form of learning behavior studied by behaviorists.</p>

While Wundt and James were concerned with understanding conscious experience, Watson thought that the study of consciousness was flawed. Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible, Watson preferred to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control. Watson was a major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior, and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_term12" group-by="b">behaviorism</span>. A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism. Behaviorism commonly used animals in experiments under the assumption that what was learned using animal models could, to some degree, be applied to human behavior. Indeed, Tolman (1938) stated, &#x201C;I believe that everything important in psychology (except &#x2026; such matters as involve society and words) can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice-point in a maze.&#x201D;</p>

          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_eip-683">Behaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades, and its influence can still be felt today (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005). Behaviorism is largely responsible for establishing psychology as a scientific discipline through its objective methods and especially experimentation. In addition, it is used in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Behavior modification is commonly used in classroom settings. Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior.</p>

Like Watson, Skinner was a behaviorist, and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences. Therefore, Skinner spoke of reinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior. As a part of his research, Skinner developed a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior through reinforcement and punishment. This device, known as an operant conditioning chamber (or more familiarly, a Skinner box), has remained a crucial resource for researchers studying behavior (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005).</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Maslow, Rogers, and Humanism</h3>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idp56995824">During the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis. However, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so influential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the unconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism. Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a combination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized personal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for &#x201C;good&#x201D; as important for our self-concept and our behavior. Thus, humanism emerged. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_term15" group-by="H">Humanism</span> is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O&#x2019;Hara, n.d.).</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm47239952">Abraham <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_term16" group-by="M">Maslow</span> (1908&#x2013;1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of human needs in motivating behavior (<a href="#auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_CNX_Psych_01_02_Maslow" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.7</a>). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for survival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate behavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we achieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic of the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005). Humanistic psychologists rejected, on principle, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and biological sciences, because it missed the &#x201C;whole&#x201D; human being. Beginning with Maslow and Rogers, there was an insistence on a humanistic research program. This program has been largely qualitative (not measurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology, including research on happiness, self-concept, meditation, and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy (Friedman, 2008).</p>

Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy. Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no matter what he or she might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005).</p>

Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names among students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced many scholars. Furthermore, Rogers&#x2019; client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in psychotherapeutic settings today (O&#x2019;hara, n.d.)</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">The Cognitive Revolution</h3>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idp101701360">Behaviorism&#x2019;s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists&#x2019; attention away from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled <em data-effect="italics">Cognitive Psychology</em>, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005).</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm121942976">Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very influential in the early days of this movement (<a href="#auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_CNX_Psych_01_02_Chomsky" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.9</a>). Chomsky (1928&#x2013;), an American linguist, was dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology&#x2019;s focus on behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).</p>

          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm66647504">European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields, like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).</p>

The dominant influence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology developed with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of society who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other countries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of psychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male psychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a &#x201C;womanless&#x201D; psychology (Crawford &amp; Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of sufficient interest to study.</p>
              <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm65561840">An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: &#x201C;We must start with the realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be womanly companions of men and to be mothers.&#x201D; Weisstein&#x2019;s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our knowledge of the psychology of women.</p>
              <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idp5166624">Crawford &amp; Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology, studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the scientific approach to knowledge.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Multicultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology</h3>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm171769824">Culture has important impacts on individuals and social psychology, yet the effects of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_term18" group-by="c">culture</span> on psychology are under-studied. There is a risk that psychological theories and data derived from White, American settings could be assumed to apply to individuals and social groups from other cultures and this is unlikely to be true (Betancourt &amp; L&#xF3;pez, 1993). One weakness in the field of cross-cultural psychology is that in looking for differences in psychological attributes across cultures, there remains a need to go beyond simple descriptive statistics (Betancourt &amp; L&#xF3;pez, 1993). In this sense, it has remained a descriptive science, rather than one seeking to determine cause and effect. For example, a study of characteristics of individuals seeking treatment for a binge eating disorder in Hispanic American, African American, and Caucasian American individuals, as they were described in the study, found significant differences between groups (Franko et al., 2012). The study concluded that results from studying any one of the groups could not be extended to the other groups, and yet potential causes of the differences were not measured. Multicultural psychologists develop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural psychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to participants from China.</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm126171232">In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United States. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early psychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting innovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American children. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in testing were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his doctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo, 1986).</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_eip-924">Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband, Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll preference, research that was instrumental in the <em data-effect="italics">Brown v. Board of Education</em> Supreme Court desegregation case. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem (American Psychological Association, 2019).

          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_zip-idm226586592">Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She wrote <em data-effect="italics">The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology</em>, and it was the standard in the field for over 20 years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but Harvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and mentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her memory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan &amp; O&#x2019;Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how structuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_zip-idm248902640">Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B. Watson&#x2019;s study of Little Albert (you&#x2019;ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned fear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_zip-idm242525456">Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser; their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology (1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African American woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, &amp; McMahon, 2005).</p>

The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance and disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA, representing a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and Spirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology. Reflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members span the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including educational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological Association, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he was an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while serving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually, he became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren &amp; Rutherford, 2010).</p>
        <p id="auto_b1926b98-3b49-4b56-ad00-73da7844bca3_zip-idm334278608">The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific orientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international, although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA), the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.</p>

          <p id="auto_b1926b98-3b49-4b56-ad00-73da7844bca3_fs-idp5606000">The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to, sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior, neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders. Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists, medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).</p>
          <p id="auto_b1926b98-3b49-4b56-ad00-73da7844bca3_fs-idp3971600">While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social environment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be adaptive and wrote books titled, <em data-effect="italics">The Descent of Man</em> (1871) and <em data-effect="italics">The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</em> (1872), to explore this field.</p>
          <p id="auto_b1926b98-3b49-4b56-ad00-73da7844bca3_fs-idm1025120">Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_b1926b98-3b49-4b56-ad00-73da7844bca3_term21" group-by="e">evolutionary psychology</span> of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason, some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants (Confer et al., 2010).</p>
          <p id="auto_b1926b98-3b49-4b56-ad00-73da7844bca3_fs-idp4168336">One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under environmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what these conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about which we can only hypothesize.</p>
          <p id="auto_b1926b98-3b49-4b56-ad00-73da7844bca3_fs-idp5217840">There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include memory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization, and status (Confer et al., 2010).</p>
          <p id="auto_b1926b98-3b49-4b56-ad00-73da7844bca3_fs-idp9100928">Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations and expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and men valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective mates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations in some cultures.</p>

Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds.

Object permanence refers to the understanding that physical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then hide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden object no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata, McClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).</p>

This may be reflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and more people live longer lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed, it is estimated that there were just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010. However, by 2020, this number is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 million people in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).</p>

Several individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of psychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality. These early theorists attempted to explain how an individual&#x2019;s personality develops from his or her given perspective. For example, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of the mind were carried out over the lifespan. Specifically, Freud theorized that an individual went through various psychosexual stages of development. According to Freud, adult personality would result from the resolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing) zones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals. Like many of Freud&#x2019;s theories, this particular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests (Person, 1980).</p>

Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals.

Social psychologists conduct research on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain the behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social psychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and patterns of thinking.</p>
          <p id="auto_b1926b98-3b49-4b56-ad00-73da7844bca3_fs-idm612224">There are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these in a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial psychological studies ever conducted. Stanley <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_b1926b98-3b49-4b56-ad00-73da7844bca3_term31" group-by="M">Milgram</span> was an American social psychologist who is most famous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were obeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (<a href="#auto_b1926b98-3b49-4b56-ad00-73da7844bca3_CNX_Psych_01_03_Milgram" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.14</a>). As you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so by an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants received payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or more serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study. No one was actually hurt or harmed in any way, Milgram&#x2019;s experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of research confederates, those who pretend to be participants in a research study who are actually working for the researcher and have clear, specific directions on how to behave during the research study (Hock, 2009). Milgram&#x2019;s and others&#x2019; studies that involved deception and potential emotional harm to study participants catalyzed the development of ethical guidelines for conducting psychological research that discourage the use of deception of research subjects, unless it can be argued not to cause harm and, in general, requiring informed consent of participants.</p>

For example, forensic psychologists (and forensic psychiatrists) will assess a person&#x2019;s competency to stand trial, assess the state of mind of a defendant, act as consultants on child custody cases, consult on sentencing and treatment recommendations, and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimony and children&#x2019;s testimony (American Board of Forensic Psychology, 2014). In these capacities, they will typically act as expert witnesses, called by either side in a court case to provide their research- or experience-based opinions. As expert witnesses, forensic psychologists must have a good understanding of the law and provide information in the context of the legal system rather than just within the realm of psychology. Forensic psychologists are also used in the jury selection process and witness preparation. They may also be involved in providing psychological treatment within the criminal justice system. Criminal profilers are a relatively small proportion of psychologists that act as consultants to law enforcement.</p>

In general, anyone wishing to continue a career in psychology at a 4-year institution of higher education will have to earn a doctoral degree in psychology for some specialties and at least a master&#x2019;s degree for others. In most areas of psychology, this means earning a PhD in a relevant area of psychology. Literally, <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_term40" group-by="P">PhD</span> refers to a doctor of philosophy degree, but here, philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per se. Rather, philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and sciences.</p>
        <p id="auto_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_fs-idp34512192">The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school, but usually, individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_term41" group-by="d">dissertation</span> is essentially a long research paper or bundled published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate&#x2019;s doctoral training. In the United States, a dissertation generally has to be defended before a committee of expert reviewers before the degree is conferred (<a href="#auto_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_CNX_Psych_01_04_Hooding" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.17</a>).</p>

Being on the faculty of a college or university often involves dividing time between teaching, research, and service to the institution and profession. The amount of time spent on each of these primary responsibilities varies dramatically from school to school, and it is not uncommon for faculty to move from place to place in search of the best personal fit among various academic environments. The previous section detailed some of the major areas that are commonly represented in psychology departments around the country; thus, depending on the training received, an individual could be anything from a biological psychologist to a clinical psychologist in an academic setting (<a href="#auto_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_CNX_Psych_01_04_Employed" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.18</a>).</p>

          <p id="auto_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_fs-idp69463072">Often times, schools offer more courses in psychology than their full-time faculty can teach. In these cases, it is not uncommon to bring in an adjunct faculty member or instructor. Adjunct faculty members and instructors usually have an advanced degree in psychology, but they often have primary careers outside of academia and serve in this role as a secondary job. Alternatively, they may not hold the doctoral degree required by most 4-year institutions and use these opportunities to gain experience in teaching. Furthermore, many 2-year colleges and schools need faculty to teach their courses in psychology. In general, many of the people who pursue careers at these institutions have master&#x2019;s degrees in psychology, although some PhDs make careers at these institutions as well.</p>
          <p id="auto_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_fs-idm40685216">Some people earning PhDs may enjoy research in an academic setting. However, they may not be interested in teaching. These individuals might take on faculty positions that are exclusively devoted to conducting research. This type of position would be more likely an option at large, research-focused universities.</p>
          <p id="auto_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_fs-idm47366656">In some areas in psychology, it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek out positions in <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_term42" group-by="p">postdoctoral training programs</span> that are available before going on to serve as faculty. In most cases, young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full-time faculty position. Postdoctoral training programs allow young scientists to further develop their research programs and broaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Career Options Outside of Academic Settings</h3>
          <p id="auto_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_fs-idp63873168">Individuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral degree, which is known as a PsyD. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_term43" group-by="P">PsyD</span> is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among individuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology. PsyD programs generally place less emphasis on research-oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context (Norcross &amp; Castle, 2002).</p>
          <p id="auto_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_fs-idm5781712">Regardless of whether earning a PhD or PsyD, in most states, an individual wishing to practice as a licensed clinical or counseling psychologist may complete postdoctoral work under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. Within the last few years, however, several states have begun to remove this requirement, which would allow people to get an earlier start in their careers (Munsey, 2009). After an individual has met the state requirements, their credentials are evaluated to determine whether they can sit for the licensure exam. Only individuals that pass this exam can call themselves licensed clinical or counseling psychologists (Norcross, n.d.). Licensed clinical or counseling psychologists can then work in a number of settings, ranging from private clinical practice to hospital settings. It should be noted that clinical psychologists and psychiatrists do different things and receive different types of education. While both can conduct therapy and counseling, clinical psychologists have a PhD or a PsyD, whereas psychiatrists have a doctor of medicine degree (MD). As such, licensed clinical psychologists can administer and interpret psychological tests, while psychiatrists can prescribe medications.</p>
          <p id="auto_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_fs-idm42881504">Individuals earning a PhD can work in a variety of settings, depending on their areas of specialization. For example, someone trained as a biopsychologist might work in a pharmaceutical company to help test the efficacy of a new drug. Someone with a clinical background might become a forensic psychologist and work within the legal system to make recommendations during criminal trials and parole hearings, or serve as an expert in a court case.</p>
          <p id="auto_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_fs-idm33736592">While earning a doctoral degree in psychology is a lengthy process, usually taking between 5&#x2013;6 years of graduate study (DeAngelis, 2010), there are a number of careers that can be attained with a master&#x2019;s degree in psychology. People who wish to provide psychotherapy can become licensed to serve as various types of professional counselors (Hoffman, 2012). Relevant master&#x2019;s degrees are also sufficient for individuals seeking careers as school psychologists (National Association of School Psychologists, n.d.), in some capacities related to sport psychology (American Psychological Association, 2014), or as consultants in various industrial settings (Landers, 2011, June 14). Undergraduate coursework in psychology may be applicable to other careers such as psychiatric social work or psychiatric nursing, where assessments and therapy may be a part of the job.</p>
          <p id="auto_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_fs-idm22096864">As mentioned in the opening section of this chapter, an undergraduate education in psychology is associated with a knowledge base and skill set that many employers find quite attractive. It should come as no surprise, then, that individuals earning bachelor&#x2019;s degrees in psychology find themselves in a number of different careers, as shown in <a href="#auto_13752615-28a0-42dd-953a-a1608c5e8026_Table_01_04_01" class="autogenerated-content">Table 1.1</a>. Examples of a few such careers can involve serving as case managers, working in sales, working in human resource departments, and teaching in high schools. The rapidly growing realm of healthcare professions is another field in which an education in psychology is helpful and sometimes required. For example, the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) exam that people must take to be admitted to medical school now includes a section on the psychological foundations of behavior.</p>

          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm127516896">Before the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However, both Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist, which meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into its component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm69010720">William James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This particular perspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism&#x2019;s environment. Like Wundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objective measures as well.</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm71138000">Sigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understand conscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysterias and neuroses. Freud relied on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access the unconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idp10521856">Gestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual and his experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and K&#xF6;hler immigrated to the United States. Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America to Gestalt ideas. Some of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensation and perception.</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm30223728">One of the most influential schools of thought within psychology&#x2019;s history was behaviorism. Behaviorism focused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the importance of unobservable mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, and B. F. Skinner&#x2019;s contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be underestimated.</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm65457616">As behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to become dissatisfied with psychology&#x2019;s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychology began to take hold. Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow and Rogers were influential in shaping humanistic psychology.</p>
          <p id="auto_73a4e3b4-c883-4dad-a47f-86ac0d3bfb8b_fs-idm89388736">During the 1950s, the landscape of psychology began to change. A science of behavior began to shift back to its roots of focus on mental processes. The emergence of neuroscience and computer science aided this transition. Ultimately, the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was crucial to a true appreciation and understanding of behavior.</p>

          <p id="auto_b1926b98-3b49-4b56-ad00-73da7844bca3_fs-idp7592400">Psychology is a diverse discipline that is made up of several major subdivisions with unique perspectives. Biological psychology involves the study of the biological bases of behavior. Sensation and perception refer to the area of psychology that is focused on how information from our sensory modalities is received, and how this information is transformed into our perceptual experiences of the world around us. Cognitive psychology is concerned with the relationship that exists between thought and behavior, and developmental psychologists study the physical and cognitive changes that occur throughout one&#x2019;s lifespan. Personality psychology focuses on individuals&#x2019; unique patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. Industrial and organizational psychology, health psychology, sport and exercise psychology, forensic psychology, and clinical psychology are all considered applied areas of psychology. Industrial and organizational psychologists apply psychological concepts to I-O settings. Health psychologists look for ways to help people live healthier lives, and clinical psychology involves the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic behavioral patterns. Sport and exercise psychologists study the interactions between thoughts, emotions, and physical performance in sports, exercise, and other activities. Forensic psychologists carry out activities related to psychology in association with the justice system.</p>

However, there are a number of nonacademic career options for people who have master&#x2019;s degrees in psychology. While people with bachelor&#x2019;s degrees in psychology have more limited psychology-related career options, the skills acquired as a function of an undergraduate education in psychology are useful in a variety of work contexts.</p>

            </h2>
            <p id="auto_3c79e138-923d-4606-8d02-24b8ce2f0afb_fs-idm165537408">Have you ever wondered whether the violence you see on television affects your behavior? Are you more likely to behave aggressively in real life after watching people behave violently in dramatic situations on the screen? Or, could seeing fictional violence actually get aggression out of your system, causing you to be more peaceful? How are children influenced by the media they are exposed to? A psychologist interested in the relationship between behavior and exposure to violent images might ask these very questions.</p>
            <p id="auto_3c79e138-923d-4606-8d02-24b8ce2f0afb_fs-idm80415680">Since ancient times, humans have been concerned about the effects of new technologies on our behaviors and thinking processes. The Greek philosopher Socrates, for example, worried that writing&#x2014;a new technology at that time&#x2014;would diminish people&#x2019;s ability to remember because they could rely on written records rather than committing information to memory. In our world of rapidly changing technologies, questions about their effects on our daily lives and their resulting long-term impacts continue to emerge. In addition to the impact of screen time (on smartphones, tablets, computers, and gaming), technology is emerging in our vehicles (such as GPS and smart cars) and residences (with devices like Alexa or Google Home and doorbell cameras). As these technologies become integrated into our lives, we are faced with questions about their positive and negative impacts. Many of us find ourselves with a strong opinion on these issues, only to find the person next to us bristling with the opposite view.</p>
            <p id="auto_3c79e138-923d-4606-8d02-24b8ce2f0afb_fs-idm152125968">How can we go about finding answers that are supported not by mere opinion, but by evidence that we can all agree on? The findings of psychological research can help us navigate issues like this.</p>

Without it, we would be forced to rely solely on intuition, other people&#x2019;s authority, and blind luck. While many of us feel confident in our abilities to decipher and interact with the world around us, history is filled with examples of how very wrong we can be when we fail to recognize the need for evidence in supporting claims. At various times in history, we would have been certain that the sun revolved around a flat earth, that the earth&#x2019;s continents did not move, and that mental illness was caused by possession (<a href="#auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_CNX_Psych_02_01_trephining" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.2</a>). It is through systematic scientific research that we divest ourselves of our preconceived notions and superstitions and gain an objective understanding of ourselves and our world.</p>

        <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idp5561792">The goal of all scientists is to better understand the world around them. Psychologists focus their attention on understanding behavior, as well as the cognitive (mental) and physiological (body) processes that underlie behavior. In contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others, such as intuition and personal experience, the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim. Scientific knowledge is <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_term44" group-by="e">empirical</span>: It is grounded in objective, tangible evidence that can be observed time and time again, regardless of who is observing.</p>
        <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idp12552816">While behavior is observable, the mind is not. If someone is crying, we can see behavior. However, the reason for the behavior is more difficult to determine. Is the person crying due to being sad, in pain, or happy? Sometimes we can learn the reason for someone&#x2019;s behavior by simply asking a question, like &#x201C;Why are you crying?&#x201D; However, there are situations in which an individual is either uncomfortable or unwilling to answer the question honestly, or is incapable of answering. For example, infants would not be able to explain why they are crying. In such circumstances, the psychologist must be creative in finding ways to better understand behavior. This chapter explores how scientific knowledge is generated, and how important that knowledge is in forming decisions in our personal lives and in the public domain.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Use of Research Information </h3>
          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idp47768912">Trying to determine which theories are and are not accepted by the scientific community can be difficult, especially in an area of research as broad as psychology. More than ever before, we have an incredible amount of information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on any given research topic might result in a number of contradictory studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community going through the process of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus emerges. For example, the explosion in our use of technology has led researchers to question whether this ultimately helps or hinders us. The use and implementation of technology in educational settings has become widespread over the last few decades. Researchers are coming to different conclusions regarding the use of technology. To illustrate this point, a study investigating a smartphone app targeting surgery residents (graduate students in surgery training) found that the use of this app can increase student engagement and raise test scores (Shaw &amp; Tan, 2015). Conversely, another study found that the use of technology in undergraduate student populations had negative impacts on sleep, communication, and time management skills (Massimini &amp; Peterson, 2009). Until sufficient amounts of research have been conducted, there will be no clear consensus on the effects that technology has on a student's acquisition of knowledge, study skills, and mental health.</p>
          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idp19976256">In the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a degree of healthy skepticism. When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of different perspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid, does the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the claim? This is especially important when we consider how much information in advertising campaigns and on the internet claims to be based on &#x201C;scientific evidence&#x201D; when in actuality it is a belief or perspective of just a few individuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives.</p>
          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idp52899376">We should be informed consumers of the information made available to us because decisions based on this information have significant consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public policy. Imagine that you have been elected as the governor of your state. One of your responsibilities is to manage the state budget and determine how to best spend your constituents&#x2019; tax dollars. As the new governor, you need to decide whether to continue funding early intervention programs. These programs are designed to help children who come from low-income backgrounds, have special needs, or face other disadvantages. These programs may involve providing a wide variety of services to maximize the children's development and position them for optimal levels of success in school and later in life (Blann, 2005). While such programs sound appealing, you would want to be sure that they also proved effective before investing additional money in these programs. Fortunately, psychologists and other scientists have conducted vast amounts of research on such programs and, in general, the programs are found to be effective (Neil &amp; Christensen, 2009; Peters-Scheffer, Didden, Korzilius, &amp; Sturmey, 2011). While not all programs are equally effective, and the short-term effects of many such programs are more pronounced, there is reason to believe that many of these programs produce long-term benefits for participants (Barnett, 2011). If you are committed to being a good steward of taxpayer money, you would want to look at research.  Which programs are most effective?  What characteristics of these programs make them effective? Which programs promote the best outcomes? After examining the research, you would be best equipped to make decisions about which programs to fund.</p>

We all might look to research from time to time when making decisions in our lives. Imagine you just found out that a close friend has breast cancer or that one of your young relatives has recently been diagnosed with autism. In either case, you want to know which treatment options are most successful with the fewest side effects. How would you find that out? You would probably talk with your doctor and personally review the research that has been done on various treatment options&#x2014;always with a critical eye to ensure that you are as informed as possible.</p>

          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_zip-idm220839488">Psychological research has a long history involving important figures from diverse backgrounds. While the introductory chapter discussed several researchers who made significant contributions to the discipline, there are many more individuals who deserve attention in considering how psychology has advanced as a science through their work (<a href="#auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_CNX_Psych_02_05_BrownBoard" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.3</a>). For instance, Margaret Floy Washburn (1871&#x2013;1939) was the first woman to earn a PhD in psychology. Her research focused on animal behavior and cognition (Margaret Floy Washburn, PhD, n.d.). Mary Whiton Calkins (1863&#x2013;1930) was a preeminent first-generation American psychologist who opposed the behaviorist movement, conducted significant research into memory, and established one of the earliest experimental psychology labs in the United States (Mary Whiton Calkins, n.d.).</p>
          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_zip-idm211568160">Francis Sumner (1895&#x2013;1954) was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in 1920. His dissertation focused on issues related to psychoanalysis. Sumner also had research interests in racial bias and educational justice. Sumner was one of the founders of Howard University&#x2019;s department of psychology, and because of his accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the &#x201C;Father of Black Psychology.&#x201D; Thirteen years later, Inez Beverly Prosser (1895&#x2013;1934) became the first African American woman to receive a PhD in psychology. Prosser&#x2019;s research highlighted issues related to education in segregated versus integrated schools, and ultimately, her work was very influential in the hallmark <em data-effect="italics">Brown v.

          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_zip-idm218056320">Although the establishment of psychology&#x2019;s scientific roots occurred first in Europe and the United States, it did not take much time until researchers from around the world began to establish their own laboratories and research programs. For example, some of the first experimental psychology laboratories in South America were founded by Horatio Pi&#xF1;ero (1869&#x2013;1919) at two institutions in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Godoy &amp; Brussino, 2010). In India, Gunamudian David Boaz (1908&#x2013;1965) and Narendra Nath Sen Gupta (1889&#x2013;1944) established the first independent departments of psychology at the University of Madras and the University of Calcutta, respectively. These developments provided an opportunity for Indian researchers to make important contributions to the field (Gunamudian David Boaz, n.d.; Narendra Nath Sen Gupta, n.d.).</p>
          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_zip-idm211605776">When the American Psychological Association (APA) was first founded in 1892, all of the members were White males (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.). However, by 1905, Mary Whiton Calkins was elected as the first female president of the APA, and by 1946, nearly one-quarter of American psychologists were female. Psychology became a popular degree option for students enrolled in the nation&#x2019;s historically Black higher education institutions, increasing the number of Black Americans who went on to become psychologists. Given demographic shifts occurring in the United States and increased access to higher educational opportunities among historically underrepresented populations, there is reason to hope that the diversity of the field will increasingly match the larger population, and that the research contributions made by the psychologists of the future will better serve people of all backgrounds (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.).</p>

          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idm13871408">In the scientific context, deductive reasoning begins with a generalization&#x2014;one hypothesis&#x2014;that is then used to reach logical conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the logical conclusions reached through deductive reasoning should also be correct. A deductive reasoning argument might go something like this: All living things require energy to survive (this would be your hypothesis). Ducks are living things. Therefore, ducks require energy to survive (logical conclusion). In this example, the hypothesis is correct; therefore, the conclusion is correct as well. Sometimes, however, an incorrect hypothesis may lead to a logical but incorrect conclusion. Consider this argument: all ducks are born with the ability to see. Quackers is a duck. Therefore, Quackers was born with the ability to see. Scientists use deductive reasoning to empirically test their hypotheses. Returning to the example of the ducks, researchers might design a study to test the hypothesis that if all living things require energy to survive, then ducks will be found to require energy to survive.</p>
          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idm17434880">Deductive reasoning starts with a generalization that is tested against real-world observations; however, inductive reasoning moves in the opposite direction. Inductive reasoning uses empirical observations to construct broad generalizations. Unlike deductive reasoning, conclusions drawn from inductive reasoning may or may not be correct, regardless of the observations on which they are based. For instance, you may notice that your favorite fruits&#x2014;apples, bananas, and oranges&#x2014;all grow on trees; therefore, you assume that all fruit must grow on trees. This would be an example of inductive reasoning, and, clearly, the existence of strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi demonstrate that this generalization is not correct despite it being based on a number of direct observations. Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate theories, which in turn generate hypotheses that are tested with deductive reasoning. In the end, science involves both deductive and inductive processes.</p>
          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idm35855312">For example, case studies, which you will read about in the next section, are heavily weighted on the side of empirical observations. Thus, case studies are closely associated with inductive processes as researchers gather massive amounts of observations and seek interesting patterns (new ideas) in the data. Experimental research, on the other hand, puts great emphasis on deductive reasoning.</p>
          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idp26993328">We&#x2019;ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas, but what sort of ideas are they, exactly? A <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_term50" group-by="t">theory</span> is a well-developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena. Theories are repeatedly checked against the world, but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once; instead, researchers create hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory.</p>
          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idp19981728">A <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_term51" group-by="h">hypothesis</span> is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct, and it is often worded as an if-then statement (e.g., if I study all night, I will get a passing grade on the test). The hypothesis is extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world. As specific hypotheses are tested, theories are modified and refined to reflect and incorporate the result of these tests <a href="#auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_CNX_Psych_02_01_Method" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.5</a>.</p>

          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idp14627664">To see how this process works, let&#x2019;s consider a specific theory and a hypothesis that might be generated from that theory. As you&#x2019;ll learn in a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotional experience relies on the physiological arousal associated with the emotional state. If you walked out of your home and discovered a very aggressive snake waiting on your doorstep, your heart would begin to race and your stomach churn. According to the James-Lange theory, these physiological changes would result in your feeling of fear. A hypothesis that could be derived from this theory might be that a person who is unaware of the physiological arousal that the sight of the snake elicits will not feel fear.</p>

Recall from the introductory chapter that Sigmund <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_term53" group-by="F">Freud</span> had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors (<a href="#auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_CNX_Psych_02_01_freud" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.6</a>). However, a major criticism of Freud&#x2019;s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable; for example, it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the id, the ego, and the superego&#x2014;the three elements of personality described in Freud&#x2019;s theories. Despite this, Freud&#x2019;s theories are widely taught in introductory psychology texts because of their historical significance for personality psychology and psychotherapy, and these remain the root of all modern forms of therapy.</p>

In broader strokes, his views set the stage for much of psychological thinking today, such as the unconscious nature of the majority of psychological processes.</span>

          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idm111024">In contrast, the James-Lange theory does generate falsifiable hypotheses, such as the one described above. Some individuals who suffer significant injuries to their spinal columns are unable to feel the bodily changes that often accompany emotional experiences. Therefore, we could test the hypothesis by determining how emotional experiences differ between individuals who have the ability to detect these changes in their physiological arousal and those who do not. In fact, this research has been conducted and while the emotional experiences of people deprived of an awareness of their physiological arousal may be less intense, they still experience emotion (Chwalisz, Diener, &amp; Gallagher, 1988).</p>
          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idp6694960">Scientific research&#x2019;s dependence on falsifiability allows for great confidence in the information that it produces. Typically, by the time information is accepted by the scientific community, it has been tested repeatedly.</p>

        <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp37050912">There are many research methods available to psychologists in their efforts to understand, describe, and explain behavior and the cognitive and biological processes that underlie it. Some methods rely on observational techniques. Other approaches involve interactions between the researcher and the individuals who are being studied&#x2014;ranging from a series of simple questions to extensive, in-depth interviews&#x2014;to well-controlled experiments.</p>
        <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp14955360">Each of these research methods has unique strengths and weaknesses, and each method may only be appropriate for certain types of research questions. For example, studies that rely primarily on observation produce incredible amounts of information, but the ability to apply this information to the larger population is somewhat limited because of small sample sizes. Survey research, on the other hand, allows researchers to easily collect data from relatively large samples. While this allows for results to be generalized to the larger population more easily, the information that can be collected on any given survey is somewhat limited and subject to problems associated with any type of self-reported data. Some researchers conduct archival research by using existing records. While this can be a fairly inexpensive way to collect data that can provide insight into a number of research questions, researchers using this approach have no control on how or what kind of data was collected. All of the methods described thus far are correlational in nature. This means that researchers can speak to important relationships that might exist between two or more variables of interest. However, correlational data cannot be used to make claims about cause-and-effect relationships.</p>
        <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp27758096">Correlational research can find a relationship between two variables, but the only way a researcher can claim that the relationship between the variables is cause and effect is to perform an experiment. In experimental research, which will be discussed later in this chapter, there is a tremendous amount of control over variables of interest. While this is a powerful approach, experiments are often conducted in artificial settings. This calls into question the validity of experimental findings with regard to how they would apply in real-world settings. In addition, many of the questions that psychologists would like to answer cannot be pursued through experimental research because of ethical concerns.</p>

There is evidence that the two girls are connected in a part of the brain called the thalamus, which is a major sensory relay center. Most incoming sensory information is sent through the thalamus before reaching higher regions of the cerebral cortex for processing.</p>

For instance, if Krista is watching a particularly funny television program, Tatiana might smile or laugh even if she is not watching the program. This particular possibility has piqued the interest of many neuroscientists who seek to understand how the brain uses sensory information.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp43343088">These twins represent an enormous resource in the study of the brain, and since their condition is very rare, it is likely that as long as their family agrees, scientists will follow these girls very closely throughout their lives to gain as much information as possible (Dominus, 2011).</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_zip-idm282340704">Over time, it has become clear that while Krista and Tatiana share some sensory experiences and motor control, they remain two distinct individuals, which provides invaluable insight for researchers interested in the mind and the brain (Egnor, 2017).</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp27779120">In observational research, scientists are conducting a <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_term54" group-by="c">clinical</span> or <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_term55" group-by="c">case study</span> when they focus on one person or just a few individuals. Indeed, some scientists spend their entire careers studying just 10&#x2013;20 individuals. Why would they do this? Obviously, when they focus their attention on a very small number of people, they can gain a precious amount of insight into those cases. The richness of information that is collected in clinical or case studies is unmatched by any other single research method. This allows the researcher to have a very deep understanding of the individuals and the particular phenomenon being studied.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp16680592">If clinical or case studies provide so much information, why are they not more frequent among researchers? As it turns out, the major benefit of this particular approach is also a weakness. As mentioned earlier, this approach is often used when studying individuals who are interesting to researchers because they have a rare characteristic. Therefore, the individuals who serve as the focus of case studies are not like most other people. If scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior, focusing attention on such a special group of people can make it difficult to generalize any observations to the larger population as a whole. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_term56" group-by="G">Generalizing</span> refers to the ability to apply the findings of a particular research project to larger segments of society. Again, case studies provide enormous amounts of information, but since the cases are so specific, the potential to apply what&#x2019;s learned to the average person may be very limited.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Naturalistic Observation</h3>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp5222752">If you want to understand how behavior occurs, one of the best ways to gain information is to simply observe the behavior in its natural context. However, people might change their behavior in unexpected ways if they know they are being observed. How do researchers obtain accurate information when people tend to hide their natural behavior? As an example, imagine that your professor asks everyone in your class to raise their hand if they always wash their hands after using the restroom. Chances are that almost everyone in the classroom will raise their hand, but do you think hand washing after every trip to the restroom is really that universal?</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp38906048">This is very similar to the phenomenon mentioned earlier in this chapter: many individuals do not feel comfortable answering a question honestly. But if we are committed to finding out the facts about hand washing, we have other options available to us.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp1651216">Suppose we send a classmate into the restroom to actually watch whether everyone washes their hands after using the restroom. Will our observer blend into the restroom environment by wearing a white lab coat, sitting with a clipboard, and staring at the sinks? We want our researcher to be inconspicuous&#x2014;perhaps standing at one of the sinks pretending to put in contact lenses while secretly recording the relevant information. This type of observational study is called <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_term57" group-by="n">naturalistic observation</span>: observing behavior in its natural setting. To better understand peer exclusion, Suzanne Fanger collaborated with colleagues at the University of Texas to observe the behavior of preschool children on a playground. How did the observers remain inconspicuous over the duration of the study? They equipped a few of the children with wireless microphones (which the children quickly forgot about) and observed while taking notes from a distance. Also, the children in that particular preschool (a &#x201C;laboratory preschool&#x201D;) were accustomed to having observers on the playground (Fanger, Frankel, &amp; Hazen, 2012).</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idm172048">It is critical that the observer be as unobtrusive and as inconspicuous as possible: when people know they are being watched, they are less likely to behave naturally. If you have any doubt about this, ask yourself how your driving behavior might differ in two situations: In the first situation, you are driving down a deserted highway during the middle of the day; in the second situation, you are being followed by a police car down the same deserted highway (<a href="#auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_CNX_Psych_02_02_policecar" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.7</a>).</p>

Indeed, some of the best-known examples of naturalistic observation involve researchers going into the field to observe various kinds of animals in their own environments. As with human studies, the researchers maintain their distance and avoid interfering with the animal subjects so as not to influence their natural behaviors. Scientists have used this technique to study social hierarchies and interactions among animals ranging from ground squirrels to gorillas. The information provided by these studies is invaluable in understanding how those animals organize socially and communicate with one another. The anthropologist Jane <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_term58" group-by="G">Goodall</span>, for example, spent nearly five decades observing the behavior of chimpanzees in Africa (<a href="#auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_CNX_Psych_02_02_goodall" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.8</a>). As an illustration of the types of concerns that a researcher might encounter in naturalistic observation, some scientists criticized Goodall for giving the chimps names instead of referring to them by numbers&#x2014;using names was thought to undermine the emotional detachment required for the objectivity of the study (McKie, 2010).</p>

Having individuals behave as they normally would in a given situation means that we have a higher degree of ecological validity, or realism, than we might achieve with other research approaches. Therefore, our ability to generalize the findings of the research to real-world situations is enhanced. If done correctly, we need not worry about people or animals modifying their behavior simply because they are being observed. Sometimes, people may assume that reality programs give us a glimpse into authentic human behavior. However, the principle of inconspicuous observation is violated as reality stars are followed by camera crews and are interviewed on camera for personal confessionals. Given that environment, we must doubt how natural and realistic their behaviors are.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idm29632464">The major downside of naturalistic observation is that they are often difficult to set up and control. In our restroom study, what if you stood in the restroom all day prepared to record people&#x2019;s hand washing behavior and no one came in? Or, what if you have been closely observing a troop of gorillas for weeks only to find that they migrated to a new place while you were sleeping in your tent? The benefit of realistic data comes at a cost. As a researcher you have no control of when (or if) you have behavior to observe. In addition, this type of observational research often requires significant investments of time, money, and a good dose of luck.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idm17305696">Sometimes studies involve structured observation. In these cases, people are observed while engaging in set, specific tasks. An excellent example of structured observation comes from Strange Situation by Mary Ainsworth (you will read more about this in the chapter on lifespan development). The Strange Situation is a procedure used to evaluate attachment styles that exist between an infant and caregiver. In this scenario, caregivers bring their infants into a room filled with toys. The Strange Situation involves a number of phases, including a stranger coming into the room, the caregiver leaving the room, and the caregiver&#x2019;s return to the room. The infant&#x2019;s behavior is closely monitored at each phase, but it is the behavior of the infant upon being reunited with the caregiver that is most telling in terms of characterizing the infant&#x2019;s attachment style with the caregiver.</p>

Generally, people who act as observers are closely involved in the research project and may unconsciously skew their observations to fit their research goals or expectations. To protect against this type of bias, researchers should have clear criteria established for the types of behaviors recorded and how those behaviors should be classified. In addition, researchers often compare observations of the same event by multiple observers, in order to test <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_term61" group-by="i">inter-rater reliability</span>: a measure of reliability that assesses the consistency of observations by different observers.</p>

Researchers study the sample and seek to generalize their findings to the population. Generally, researchers will begin this process by calculating various measures of central tendency from the data they have collected. These measures provide an overall summary of what a typical response looks like. There are three measures of central tendency: mode, median, and mean. The mode is the most frequently occurring response, the median lies at the middle of a given data set, and the mean is the arithmetic average of all data points. Means tend to be most useful in conducting additional analyses like those described below; however, means are very sensitive to the effects of outliers, and so one must be aware of those effects when making assessments of what measures of central tendency tell us about a data set in question.</p>

By using surveys, we can collect information from a larger sample of people. A larger sample is better able to reflect the actual diversity of the population, thus allowing better generalizability. Therefore, if our sample is sufficiently large and diverse, we can assume that the data we collect from the survey can be generalized to the larger population with more certainty than the information collected through a case study. However, given the greater number of people involved, we are not able to collect the same depth of information on each person that would be collected in a case study.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp2566960">Another potential weakness of surveys is something we touched on earlier in this chapter: People don't always give accurate responses. They may lie, misremember, or answer questions in a way that they think makes them look good. For example, people may report drinking less alcohol than is actually the case.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp4054560">Any number of research questions can be answered through the use of surveys. One real-world example is the research conducted by Jenkins, Ruppel, Kizer, Yehl, and Griffin (2012) about the backlash against the US Arab-American community following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Jenkins and colleagues wanted to determine to what extent these negative attitudes toward Arab-Americans still existed nearly a decade after the attacks occurred. In one study, 140 research participants filled out a survey with 10 questions, including questions asking directly about the participant&#x2019;s overt prejudicial attitudes toward people of various ethnicities. The survey also asked indirect questions about how likely the participant would be to interact with a person of a given ethnicity in a variety of settings (such as, &#x201C;How likely do you think it is that you would introduce yourself to a person of Arab-American descent?&#x201D;). The results of the research suggested that participants were unwilling to report prejudicial attitudes toward any ethnic group. However, there were significant differences between their pattern of responses to questions about social interaction with Arab-Americans compared to other ethnic groups: they indicated less willingness for social interaction with Arab-Americans compared to the other ethnic groups. This suggested that the participants harbored subtle forms of prejudice against Arab-Americans, despite their assertions that this was not the case (Jenkins et al., 2012).</p>

For one, the researcher employing archival research never directly interacts with research participants. Therefore, the investment of time and money to collect data is considerably less with archival research. Additionally, researchers have no control over what information was originally collected. Therefore, research questions have to be tailored so they can be answered within the structure of the existing data sets. There is also no guarantee of consistency between the records from one source to another, which might make comparing and contrasting different data sets problematic.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Longitudinal and Cross-Sectional Research </h3>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp28905344">Sometimes we want to see how people change over time, as in studies of human development and lifespan. When we test the same group of individuals repeatedly over an extended period of time, we are conducting longitudinal research. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_term66" group-by="L">Longitudinal research</span> is a research design in which data-gathering is administered repeatedly over an extended period of time. For example, we may survey a group of individuals about their dietary habits at age 20, retest them a decade later at age 30, and then again at age 40.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idm13862000">Another approach is cross-sectional research. In <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_term67" group-by="c">cross-sectional research</span>, a researcher compares multiple segments of the population at the same time. Using the dietary habits example above, the researcher might directly compare different groups of people by age. Instead of studying a group of people for 20 years to see how their dietary habits changed from decade to decade, the researcher would study a group of 20-year-old individuals and compare them to a group of 30-year-old individuals and a group of 40-year-old individuals. While cross-sectional research requires a shorter-term investment, it is also limited by differences that exist between the different generations (or cohorts) that have nothing to do with age per se, but rather reflect the social and cultural experiences of different generations of individuals make them different from one another.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idm80859408">To illustrate this concept, consider the following survey findings. In recent years there has been significant growth in the popular support of same-sex marriage. Many studies on this topic break down survey participants into different age groups. In general, younger people are more supportive of same-sex marriage than are those who are older (Jones, 2013). Does this mean that as we age we become less open to the idea of same-sex marriage, or does this mean that older individuals have different perspectives because of the social climates in which they grew up? Longitudinal research is a powerful approach because the same individuals are involved in the research project over time, which means that the researchers need to be less concerned with differences among cohorts affecting the results of their study.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idm27520992">Often longitudinal studies are employed when researching various diseases in an effort to understand particular risk factors. Such studies often involve tens of thousands of individuals who are followed for several decades. Given the enormous number of people involved in these studies, researchers can feel confident that their findings can be generalized to the larger population. The Cancer Prevention Study-3 (CPS-3) is one of a series of longitudinal studies sponsored by the American Cancer Society aimed at determining predictive risk factors associated with cancer. When participants enter the study, they complete a survey about their lives and family histories, providing information on factors that might cause or prevent the development of cancer. Then every few years the participants receive additional surveys to complete. In the end, hundreds of thousands of participants will be tracked over 20 years to determine which of them develop cancer and which do not.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp3823472">Clearly, this type of research is important and potentially very informative. For instance, earlier longitudinal studies sponsored by the American Cancer Society provided some of the first scientific demonstrations of the now well-established links between increased rates of cancer and smoking (American Cancer Society, n.d.)

          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp7326832">As with any research strategy, longitudinal research is not without limitations. For one, these studies require an incredible time investment by the researcher and research participants. Given that some longitudinal studies take years, if not decades, to complete, the results will not be known for a considerable period of time. In addition to the time demands, these studies also require a substantial financial investment. Many researchers are unable to commit the resources necessary to see a longitudinal project through to the end.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp31341952">Research participants must also be willing to continue their participation for an extended period of time, and this can be problematic. People move, get married and take new names, get ill, and eventually die. Even without significant life changes, some people may simply choose to discontinue their participation in the project. As a result, the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_term68" group-by="a">attrition</span> rates, or reduction in the number of research participants due to dropouts, in longitudinal studies are quite high and increases over the course of a project. For this reason, researchers using this approach typically recruit many participants fully expecting that a substantial number will drop out before the end. As the study progresses, they continually check whether the sample still represents the larger population, and make adjustments as necessary.</p>

Is it possible that indulging in your favorite flavor of ice cream could send you on a crime spree? Or, after committing crime do you think you might decide to treat yourself to a cone? There is no question that a relationship exists between ice cream and crime (e.g., Harper, 2013), but it would be pretty foolish to decide that one thing actually caused the other to occur.</p>
        <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm8747152">It is much more likely that both ice cream sales and crime rates are related to the temperature outside. When the temperature is warm, there are lots of people out of their houses, interacting with each other, getting annoyed with one another, and sometimes committing crimes. Also, when it is warm outside, we are more likely to seek a cool treat like ice cream. How do we determine if there is indeed a relationship between two things? And when there is a relationship, how can we discern whether it is attributable to coincidence or causation?</p>

When two variables are correlated, it simply means that as one variable changes, so does the other. We can measure correlation by calculating a statistic known as a correlation coefficient. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_term70" group-by="c">correlation coefficient</span> is a number from -1 to +1 that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between variables.

          <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idp46664736">The number portion of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship. The closer the number is to 1 (be it negative or positive), the more strongly related the variables are, and the more predictable changes in one variable will be as the other variable changes. The closer the number is to zero, the weaker the relationship, and the less predictable the relationships between the variables becomes. For instance, a correlation coefficient of 0.9 indicates a far stronger relationship than a correlation coefficient of 0.3. If the variables are not related to one another at all, the correlation coefficient is 0. The example above about ice cream and crime is an example of two variables that we might expect to have no relationship to each other.</p>

Other examples of positive correlations are the relationship between an individual&#x2019;s height and weight or the relationship between a person&#x2019;s age and number of wrinkles. One might expect a negative correlation to exist between someone&#x2019;s tiredness during the day and the number of hours they slept the previous night: the amount of sleep decreases as the feelings of tiredness increase. In a real-world example of negative correlation, student researchers at the University of Minnesota found a weak negative correlation (<em data-effect="italics">r</em> = -0.29) between the average number of days per week that students got fewer than 5 hours of sleep and their GPA (Lowry, Dean, &amp; Manders, 2010). Keep in mind that a negative correlation is not the same as no correlation. For example, we would probably find no correlation between hours of sleep and shoe size.</p>

Imagine that you are on the admissions committee of a major university. You are faced with a huge number of applications, but you are able to accommodate only a small percentage of the applicant pool. How might you decide who should be admitted? You might try to correlate your current students&#x2019; college GPA with their scores on standardized tests like the SAT or ACT. By observing which correlations were strongest for your current students, you could use this information to predict relative success of those students who have applied for admission into the university.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">Correlation Does Not Indicate Causation </h4>
            <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idp46775888">Correlational research is useful because it allows us to discover the strength and direction of relationships that exist between two variables. However, correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a relationship tells us little about <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_term73" group-by="c">cause and effect</span>. While variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other, it could also be that some other factor, a <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_term74" group-by="c">confounding variable</span>, is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest. In the ice cream/crime rate example mentioned earlier, temperature is a confounding variable that could account for the relationship between the two variables.</p>
            <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm12088928">Even when we cannot point to clear confounding variables, we should not assume that a correlation between two variables implies that one variable causes changes in another. This can be frustrating when a cause-and-effect relationship seems clear and intuitive. Think back to our discussion of the research done by the American Cancer Society and how their research projects were some of the first demonstrations of the link between smoking and cancer. It seems reasonable to assume that smoking causes cancer, but if we were limited to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_term75" group-by="c">correlational research</span>, we would be overstepping our bounds by making this assumption.</p>

Such claims are especially common in advertisements and news stories. For example, recent research found that people who eat cereal on a regular basis achieve healthier weights than those who rarely eat cereal (Frantzen, Trevi&#xF1;o, Echon, Garcia-Dominic, &amp; DiMarco, 2013; Barton et al., 2005). Guess how the cereal companies report this finding. Does eating cereal really cause an individual to maintain a healthy weight, or are there other possible explanations, such as, someone at a healthy weight is more likely to regularly eat a healthy breakfast than someone who is obese or someone who avoids meals in an attempt to diet (<a href="#auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_CNX_Psych_02_04_cereal" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.13</a>)? While correlational research is invaluable in identifying relationships among variables, a major limitation is the inability to establish causality. Psychologists want to make statements about cause and effect, but the only way to do that is to conduct an experiment to answer a research question. The next section describes how scientific experiments incorporate methods that eliminate, or control for, alternative explanations, which allow researchers to explore how changes in one variable cause changes in another variable.</p>

The ebb and flow of the ocean&#x2019;s tides are tightly tied to the gravitational forces of the moon. Many people believe, therefore, that it is logical that we are affected by the moon as well. After all, our bodies are largely made up of water. A meta-analysis of nearly 40 studies consistently demonstrated, however, that the relationship between the moon and our behavior does not exist (Rotton &amp; Kelly, 1985). While we may pay more attention to odd behavior during the full phase of the moon, the rates of odd behavior remain constant throughout the lunar cycle.</p>

Often we read or hear about them and simply accept the information as valid. Or, we have a hunch about how something works and then look for evidence to support that hunch, ignoring evidence that would tell us our hunch is false; this is known as <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_term77" group-by="c">confirmation bias</span>. Other times, we find illusory correlations based on the information that comes most easily to mind, even if that information is severely limited. And while we may feel confident that we can use these relationships to better understand and predict the world around us, illusory correlations can have significant drawbacks. For example, research suggests that illusory correlations&#x2014;in which certain behaviors are inaccurately attributed to certain groups&#x2014;are involved in the formation of prejudicial attitudes that can ultimately lead to discriminatory behavior (Fiedler, 2004).</p>

In operationalizing learning, we might choose to look at performance on a test covering the material on which the individuals were taught by the teacher or the computer program. We might also ask our participants to summarize the information that was just presented in some way. Whatever we determine, it is important that we operationalize learning in such a way that anyone who hears about our study for the first time knows exactly what we mean by learning. This aids peoples&#x2019; ability to interpret our data as well as their capacity to repeat our experiment should they choose to do so.</p>

In other words, simply expecting something to happen can actually make it happen.</p>
            <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm31186832">The placebo effect is commonly described in terms of testing the effectiveness of a new medication. Imagine that you work in a pharmaceutical company, and you think you have a new drug that is effective in treating depression. To demonstrate that your medication is effective, you run an experiment with two groups: The experimental group receives the medication, and the control group does not. But you don&#x2019;t want participants to know whether they received the drug or not.</p>
            <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm15150144">Why is that? Imagine that you are a participant in this study, and you have just taken a pill that you think will improve your mood. Because you expect the pill to have an effect, you might feel better simply because you took the pill and not because of any drug actually contained in the pill&#x2014;this is the placebo effect.</p>
            <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm32705440">To make sure that any effects on mood are due to the drug and not due to expectations, the control group receives a placebo (in this case a sugar pill). Now everyone gets a pill, and once again neither the researcher nor the experimental participants know who got the drug and who got the sugar pill. Any differences in mood between the experimental and control groups can now be attributed to the drug itself rather than to experimenter bias or participant expectations (<a href="#auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_CNX_Psych_02_05_placebo" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.16</a>).</p>

To achieve this, we must pay attention to two important variables, or things that can be changed, in any experimental study: the independent variable and the dependent variable. An <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_term87" group-by="i">independent variable</span> is manipulated or controlled by the experimenter. In a well-designed experimental study, the independent variable is the only important difference between the experimental and control groups. In our example of how technology use in the classroom affects learning, the independent variable is the type of learning by participants in the study (<a href="#auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_CNX_Psych_02_05_variables" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.17</a>).

Our study involves human participants so we need to determine who to include. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_term89" group-by="P">Participants</span> are the subjects of psychological research, and as the name implies, individuals who are involved in psychological research actively participate in the process. Often, psychological research projects rely on college students to serve as participants. In fact, the vast majority of research in psychology subfields has historically involved students as research participants (Sears, 1986; Arnett, 2008). But are college students truly representative of the general population? College students tend to be younger, more educated, more liberal, and less diverse than the general population. Although using students as test subjects is an accepted practice, relying on such a limited pool of research participants can be problematic because it is difficult to generalize findings to the larger population.</p>
            <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm53871616">Our hypothetical experiment involves high school students, and we must first generate a sample of students. Samples are used because populations are usually too large to reasonably involve every member in our particular experiment (<a href="#auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_CNX_Psych_02_05_sample" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.18</a>). If possible, we should use a random sample (there are other types of samples, but for the purposes of this chapter, we will focus on random samples). A <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_term90" group-by="r">random sample</span> is a subset of a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. Random samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be reasonably sure that the participating individuals are representative of the larger population. This means that the percentages of characteristics in the sample&#x2014;sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and any other characteristics that might affect the results&#x2014;are close to those percentages in the larger population.</p>
            <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm59772960">In our example, let&#x2019;s say we decide our population of interest is algebra students. But all algebra students is a very large population, so we need to be more specific; instead we might say our population of interest is all algebra students in a particular city. We should include students from various income brackets, family situations, races, ethnicities, religions, and geographic areas of town. With this more manageable population, we can work with the local schools in selecting a random sample of around 200 algebra students who we want to participate in our experiment.</p>
            <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm43561728">In summary, because we cannot test all of the algebra students in a city, we want to find a group of about 200 that reflects the composition of that city. With a representative group, we can generalize our findings to the larger population without fear of our sample being biased in some way.</p>

With <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_term91" group-by="r">random assignment</span>, all participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either group.

With sufficiently large samples, random assignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic differences between the groups. So, for instance, it would be very unlikely that we would get one group composed entirely of males, a given ethnic identity, or a given religious ideology. This is important because if the groups were systematically different before the experiment began, we would not know the origin of any differences we find between the groups: Were the differences preexisting, or were they caused by manipulation of the independent variable? Random assignment allows us to assume that any differences observed between experimental and control groups result from the manipulation of the independent variable.</p>

True experiments require the experimenter to manipulate an independent variable, and that can complicate many questions that psychologists might want to address. For instance, imagine that you want to know what effect sex (the independent variable) has on spatial memory (the dependent variable). Although you can certainly look for differences between males and females on a task that taps into spatial memory, you cannot directly control a person&#x2019;s sex. We categorize this type of research approach as quasi-experimental and recognize that we cannot make cause-and-effect claims in these circumstances.</p>
            <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm110237888">Experimenters are also limited by ethical constraints. For instance, you would not be able to conduct an experiment designed to determine if experiencing abuse as a child leads to lower levels of self-esteem among adults. To conduct such an experiment, you would need to randomly assign some experimental participants to a group that receives abuse, and that experiment would be unethical.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">Interpreting Experimental Findings</h4>

A statistical analysis determines how likely any difference found is due to chance (and thus not meaningful). For example, if an experiment is done on the effectiveness of a nutritional supplement, and those taking a placebo pill (and not the supplement) have the same result as those taking the supplement, then the experiment has shown that the nutritional supplement is not effective. Generally, psychologists consider differences to be statistically significant if there is less than a five percent chance of observing them if the groups did not actually differ from one another. Stated another way, psychologists want to limit the chances of making &#x201C;false positive&#x201D; claims to five percent or less.</p>
            <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm9623648">The greatest strength of experiments is the ability to assert that any significant differences in the findings are caused by the independent variable. This occurs because random selection, random assignment, and a design that limits the effects of both experimenter bias and participant expectancy should create groups that are similar in composition and treatment. Therefore, any difference between the groups is attributable to the independent variable, and now we can finally make a causal statement. If we find that watching a violent television program results in more violent behavior than watching a nonviolent program, we can safely say that watching violent television programs causes an increase in the display of violent behavior.</p>

These peer reviewers provide feedback&#x2014;to both the author and the journal editor&#x2014;regarding the quality of the draft. Peer reviewers look for a strong rationale for the research being described, a clear description of how the research was conducted, and evidence that the research was conducted in an ethical manner. They also look for flaws in the study's design, methods, and statistical analyses. They check that the conclusions drawn by the authors seem reasonable given the observations made during the research. Peer reviewers also comment on how valuable the research is in advancing the discipline&#x2019;s knowledge. This helps prevent unnecessary duplication of research findings in the scientific literature and, to some extent, ensures that each research article provides new information. Ultimately, the journal editor will compile all of the peer reviewer feedback and determine whether the article will be published in its current state (a rare occurrence), published with revisions, or not accepted for publication.</p>

Poorly conceived or executed studies can be weeded out, and even well-designed research can be improved by the revisions suggested. Peer review also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_term95" group-by="r">replicate</span> it, meaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability. Sometimes replications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding. In any case, each replication serves to provide more evidence to support the original research findings. Successful replications of published research make scientists more apt to adopt those findings, while repeated failures tend to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the original article and lead scientists to look elsewhere. For example, it would be a major advancement in the medical field if a published study indicated that taking a new drug helped individuals achieve a healthy weight without changing their diet. But if other scientists could not replicate the results, the original study&#x2019;s claims would be questioned.</p>

Some of the most well-known studies and scientists have produced research that has failed to be replicated by others (as discussed in Shrout &amp; Rodgers, 2018). In fact, even a famous Nobel Prize-winning scientist has recently retracted a published paper because she had difficulty replicating her results (Nobel Prize-winning scientist Frances Arnold retracts paper, 2020 January 3). These kinds of outcomes have prompted some scientists to begin to work together and more openly, and some would argue that the current &#x201C;crisis&#x201D; is actually improving the ways in which science is conducted and in how its results are shared with others (Aschwanden, 2018).</p>

Since the initial reports, large-scale epidemiological research has suggested that vaccinations are not responsible for causing autism and that it is much safer to have your child vaccinated than not. Furthermore, several of the original studies making this claim have since been retracted.</p>
                <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm28915072">A published piece of work can be rescinded when data is called into question because of falsification, fabrication, or serious research design problems. Once rescinded, the scientific community is informed that there are serious problems with the original publication. Retractions can be initiated by the researcher who led the study, by research collaborators, by the institution that employed the researcher, or by the editorial board of the journal in which the article was originally published. In the vaccine-autism case, the retraction was made because of a significant conflict of interest in which the leading researcher had a financial interest in establishing a link between childhood vaccines and autism (Offit, 2008). Unfortunately, the initial studies received so much media attention that many parents around the world became hesitant to have their children vaccinated (<a href="#auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_CNX_Psych_02_05_vaccine" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.19</a>). Continued reliance on such debunked studies has significant consequences. For instance, between January and October of 2019, there were 22 measles outbreaks across the United States and more than a thousand cases of individuals contracting measles (Patel et al., 2019). This is likely due to the anti-vaccination movements that have risen from the debunked research. For more information about how the vaccine/autism story unfolded, as well as the repercussions of this story, take a look at Paul Offit&#x2019;s book, <em data-effect="italics">Autism&#x2019;s False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure.</em></p>

          <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm12719232">Reliability and validity are two important considerations that must be made with any type of data collection. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_term96" group-by="R">Reliability</span> refers to the ability to consistently produce a given result. In the context of psychological research, this would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in consistent, reproducible ways. There are a number of different types of reliability. Some of these include inter-rater reliability (the degree to which two or more different observers agree on what has been observed), internal consistency (the degree to which different items on a survey that measure the same thing correlate with one another), and test-retest reliability (the degree to which the outcomes of a particular measure remain consistent over multiple administrations).</p>
          <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm47286192">Unfortunately, being consistent in measurement does not necessarily mean that you have measured something correctly. To illustrate this concept, consider a kitchen scale that would be used to measure the weight of cereal that you eat in the morning. If the scale is not properly calibrated, it may consistently under- or overestimate the amount of cereal that&#x2019;s being measured. While the scale is highly reliable in producing consistent results (e.g., the same amount of cereal poured onto the scale produces the same reading each time), those results are incorrect. This is where validity comes into play. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_term97" group-by="V">Validity</span> refers to the extent to which a given instrument or tool accurately measures what it&#x2019;s supposed to measure, and once again, there are a number of ways in which validity can be expressed. Ecological validity (the degree to which research results generalize to real-world applications), construct validity (the degree to which a given variable actually captures or measures what it is intended to measure), and face validity (the degree to which a given variable seems valid on the surface) are just a few types that researchers consider. While any valid measure is by necessity reliable, the reverse is not necessarily true. Researchers strive to use instruments that are both highly reliable and valid.</p>

              </h4>

Standardized tests like the SAT and ACT are supposed to measure an individual&#x2019;s aptitude for a college education, but how reliable and valid are such tests? Research conducted by the College Board suggests that scores on the SAT have high predictive validity for first-year college students&#x2019; GPA (Kobrin, Patterson, Shaw, Mattern, &amp; Barbuti, 2008). In this context, predictive validity refers to the test&#x2019;s ability to effectively predict the GPA of college freshmen. Given that many institutions of higher education require the SAT or ACT for admission, this high degree of predictive validity might be comforting.</p>
              <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idp46777312">However, the emphasis placed on SAT or ACT scores in college admissions has generated some controversy on a number of fronts. For one, some researchers assert that these tests are biased and place minority students at a disadvantage and unfairly reduces the likelihood of being admitted into a college (Santelices &amp; Wilson, 2010). Additionally, some research has suggested that the predictive validity of these tests is grossly exaggerated in how well they are able to predict the GPA of first-year college students. In fact, it has been suggested that the SAT&#x2019;s predictive validity may be overestimated by as much as 150% (Rothstein, 2004). Many institutions of higher education are beginning to consider de-emphasizing the significance of SAT scores in making admission decisions (Rimer, 2008).</p>
              <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm62166896">Recent examples of high profile cheating scandals both domestically and abroad have only increased the scrutiny being placed on these types of tests, and as of March 2019, more than 1000 institutions of higher education have either relaxed or eliminated the requirements for SAT or ACT testing for admissions (Strauss, 2019, March 19).</p>

In 1932, poor, rural, Black, male sharecroppers from Tuskegee, Alabama, were recruited to participate in an experiment conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service, with the aim of studying syphilis in Black men (<a href="#auto_027c2589-b86d-4757-bfc8-907794add350_CNX_Psych_02_06_tuskegee" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.21</a>). In exchange for free medical care, meals, and burial insurance, 600 men agreed to participate in the study. A little more than half of the men tested positive for syphilis, and they served as the experimental group (given that the researchers could not randomly assign participants to groups, this represents a quasi-experiment). The remaining syphilis-free individuals served as the control group. However, those individuals that tested positive for syphilis were never informed that they had the disease.</p>
              <p id="auto_027c2589-b86d-4757-bfc8-907794add350_fs-idm32653616">While there was no treatment for syphilis when the study began, by 1947 penicillin was recognized as an effective treatment for the disease. Despite this, no penicillin was administered to the participants in this study, and the participants were not allowed to seek treatment at any other facilities if they continued in the study. Over the course of 40 years, many of the participants unknowingly spread syphilis to their wives (and subsequently their children born from their wives) and eventually died because they never received treatment for the disease. This study was discontinued in 1972 when the experiment was discovered by the national press (Tuskegee University, n.d.). The resulting outrage over the experiment led directly to the National Research Act of 1974 and the strict ethical guidelines for research on humans described in this chapter. Why is this study unethical? How were the men who participated and their families harmed as a function of this research?</p>

          <p id="auto_1db17970-a37e-48e8-b20c-941b52ce73ef_fs-idm4574368">Scientists are engaged in explaining and understanding how the world around them works, and they are able to do so by coming up with theories that generate hypotheses that are testable and falsifiable. Theories that stand up to their tests are retained and refined, while those that do not are discarded or modified. In this way, research enables scientists to separate fact from simple opinion. Having good information generated from research aids in making wise decisions both in public policy and in our personal lives.</p>

          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idm21591152">The clinical or case study involves studying just a few individuals for an extended period of time. While this approach provides an incredible depth of information, the ability to generalize these observations to the larger population is problematic. Naturalistic observation involves observing behavior in a natural setting and allows for the collection of valid, true-to-life information from realistic situations. However, naturalistic observation does not allow for much control and often requires quite a bit of time and money to perform. Researchers strive to ensure that their tools for collecting data are both reliable (consistent and replicable) and valid (accurate).</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp19925040">Surveys can be administered in a number of ways and make it possible to collect large amounts of data quickly. However, the depth of information that can be collected through surveys is somewhat limited compared to a clinical or case study.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idp25313904">Archival research involves studying existing data sets to answer research questions.</p>
          <p id="auto_39351c07-aca5-44e0-9276-f83f2893145a_fs-idm34110976">Longitudinal research has been incredibly helpful to researchers who need to collect data on how people change over time. Cross-sectional research compares multiple segments of a population at a single time.</p>

          <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm50785152">A correlation is described with a correlation coefficient, <em data-effect="italics">r</em>, which ranges from -1 to 1. The correlation coefficient tells us about the nature (positive or negative) and the strength of the relationship between two or more variables. Correlations do not tell us anything about causation&#x2014;regardless of how strong the relationship is between variables. In fact, the only way to demonstrate causation is by conducting an experiment. People often make the mistake of claiming that correlations exist when they really do not.</p>
          <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm27914128">Researchers can test cause-and-effect hypotheses by conducting experiments. Ideally, experimental participants are randomly selected from the population of interest. Then, the participants are randomly assigned to their respective groups. Sometimes, the researcher and the participants are blind to group membership to prevent their expectations from influencing the results.</p>
          <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm45123680">In ideal experimental design, the only difference between the experimental and control groups is whether participants are exposed to the experimental manipulation. Each group goes through all phases of the experiment, but each group will experience a different level of the independent variable: the experimental group is exposed to the experimental manipulation, and the control group is not exposed to the experimental manipulation. The researcher then measures the changes that are produced in the dependent variable in each group. Once data is collected from both groups, it is analyzed statistically to determine if there are meaningful differences between the groups.</p>
          <p id="auto_44e86fdd-1b17-4e86-8c8b-945230d8133a_fs-idm28746832">Psychologists report their research findings in peer-reviewed journal articles. Research published in this format is checked by several other psychologists who serve as a filter separating ideas that are supported by evidence from ideas that are not. Replication has an important role in ensuring the legitimacy of published research. In the long run, only those findings that are capable of being replicated consistently will achieve consensus in the scientific community.</p>

          <p id="auto_027c2589-b86d-4757-bfc8-907794add350_fs-idp21409168">Ethics in research is an evolving field, and some practices that were accepted or tolerated in the past would be considered unethical today. Researchers are expected to adhere to basic ethical guidelines when conducting experiments that involve human participants. Any experiment involving human participants must be approved by an IRB. Participation in experiments is voluntary and requires informed consent of the participants. If any deception is involved in the experiment, each participant must be fully debriefed upon the conclusion of the study.</p>
          <p id="auto_027c2589-b86d-4757-bfc8-907794add350_fs-idp744544">Animal research is also held to a high ethical standard. Researchers who use animals as experimental subjects must design their projects so that pain and distress are minimized. Animal research requires the approval of an IACUC, and all animal facilities are subject to regular inspections to ensure that animals are being treated humanely.</p>

Specifically, it was found that women consuming more than 5 cups of coffee a day were less likely to develop breast cancer than women who never consumed coffee (Lowcock, Cotterchio, Anderson, Boucher, &amp; El-Sohemy, 2013). Imagine you see a newspaper story about this research that says, &#x201C;Coffee Protects Against Cancer.&#x201D; Why is this headline misleading and why would a more accurate headline draw less interest?</p>

Many of us have done so, whether to attempt a repair or simply to satisfy our curiosity. A device&#x2019;s internal workings are often distinct from its user interface on the outside. For example, we don&#x2019;t think about microchips and circuits when we turn up the volume on a mobile phone; instead, we think about getting the volume just right. Similarly, the inner workings of the human body are often distinct from the external expression of those workings. It is the job of psychologists to find the connection between these&#x2014;for example, to figure out how the firings of millions of neurons become a thought.</p>
            <p id="auto_2d810341-0673-49f1-b8ba-485c99e04baa_fs-id1461247">This chapter strives to explain the biological mechanisms that underlie behavior. These physiological and anatomical foundations are the basis for many areas of psychology. In this chapter, you will learn how genetics influence both physiological and psychological traits. You will become familiar with the structure and function of the nervous system. And, finally, you will learn how the nervous system interacts with the endocrine system.</p>

        <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1493420">Psychological researchers study genetics in order to better understand the biological factors that contribute to certain behaviors. While all humans share certain biological mechanisms, we are each unique. And while our bodies have many of the same parts&#x2014;brains and hormones and cells with genetic codes&#x2014;these are expressed in a wide variety of behaviors, thoughts, and reactions.</p>
        <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1337483">Why do two people infected by the same disease have different outcomes: one surviving and one succumbing to the ailment? How are genetic diseases passed through family lines? Are there genetic components to psychological disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia? To what extent might there be a psychological basis to health conditions such as childhood obesity?</p>
        <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1510087">To explore these questions, let&#x2019;s start by focusing on a specific genetic disorder, sickle cell anemia, and how it might manifest in two affected sisters. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic condition in which red blood cells, which are normally round, take on a crescent-like shape (<a href="#auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_CNX_Psych_03_01_SickleCell" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.2</a>). The changed shape of these cells affects how they function: sickle-shaped cells can clog blood vessels and block blood flow, leading to high fever, severe pain, swelling, and tissue damage.</p>

        <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1572178">Many people with sickle-cell anemia&#x2014;and the particular genetic mutation that causes it&#x2014;die at an early age. While the notion of &#x201C;survival of the fittest&#x201D; may suggest that people suffering from this disorder have a low survival rate and therefore the disorder will become less common, this is not the case. Despite the negative evolutionary effects associated with this genetic mutation, the sickle-cell gene remains relatively common among people of African descent. Why is this? The explanation is illustrated with the following scenario.</p>
        <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1582670">Imagine two young women&#x2014;Luwi and Sena&#x2014;sisters in rural Zambia, Africa. Luwi carries the gene for sickle-cell anemia; Sena does not carry the gene. Sickle-cell carriers have one copy of the sickle-cell gene but do not have full-blown sickle-cell anemia. They experience symptoms only if they are severely dehydrated or are deprived of oxygen (as in mountain climbing). Carriers are thought to be immune from malaria (an often deadly disease that is widespread in tropical climates) because changes in their blood chemistry and immune functioning prevent the malaria parasite from having its effects (Gong, Parikh, Rosenthal, &amp; Greenhouse, 2013). However, full-blown sickle-cell anemia, with two copies of the sickle-cell gene, does not provide immunity to malaria.</p>
        <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1514511">While walking home from school, both sisters are bitten by mosquitoes carrying the malaria parasite. Luwi is protected against malaria because she carries the sickle-cell mutation. Sena, on the other hand, develops malaria and dies just two weeks later. Luwi survives and eventually has children, to whom she may pass on the sickle-cell mutation.</p>

        <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1505972">Malaria is rare in the United States, so the sickle-cell gene benefits nobody: the gene manifests primarily in minor health problems for carriers with one copy, or a severe full-blown disease with no health benefits for carriers with two copies. However, the situation is quite different in other parts of the world. In parts of Africa where malaria is prevalent, having the sickle-cell mutation does provide health benefits for carriers (protection from malaria). </p>
        <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1572744">The story of malaria fits with Charles Darwin's <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_term105" group-by="t">theory of evolution by natural selection</span> (<a href="#auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_CNX_Psych_03_01_Darwin" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.3</a>). In simple terms, the theory states that organisms that are better suited for their environment will survive and reproduce, while those that are poorly suited for their environment will die off. In our example, we can see that, as a carrier, Luwi&#x2019;s mutation is highly adaptive in her African homeland; however, if she resided in the United States (where malaria is rare), her mutation could prove costly&#x2014;with a high probability of the disease in her descendants and minor health problems of her own.</p>

            <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1228457">In both fields, it is understood that genes not only code for particular traits, but also contribute to certain patterns of cognition and behavior. Evolutionary psychology focuses on how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have evolved over time. Therefore, variations in cognition and behavior would make individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing those genes on to their offspring. Evolutionary psychologists study a variety of psychological phenomena that may have evolved as adaptations, including fear response, food preferences, mate selection, and cooperative behaviors (Confer et al., 2010). </p>
            <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1368258">Whereas evolutionary psychologists focus on universal patterns that evolved over millions of years, behavioral geneticists study how individual differences arise, in the present, through the interaction of genes and the environment. When studying human behavior, behavioral geneticists often employ twin and adoption studies to research questions of interest. Twin studies compare the likelihood that a given behavioral trait is shared among identical and fraternal twins; adoption studies compare those rates among biologically related relatives and adopted relatives. Both approaches provide some insight into the relative importance of genes and environment for the expression of a given trait.</p>

          <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1590033">Genetic variation, the genetic difference between individuals, is what contributes to a species&#x2019; adaptation to its environment. In humans, genetic variation begins with an egg, about 100 million sperm, and fertilization. Fertile women ovulate roughly once per month, releasing an egg from follicles in the ovary. During the egg's journey from the ovary through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus, a sperm may fertilize the egg.</p>
          <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1565506">The egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_term108" group-by="C">Chromosomes</span> are long strings of genetic material known as <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_term109" group-by="d">deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</span>.

If someone with this condition goes untreated, he or she will experience significant deficits in cognitive function, seizures, and an increased risk of various psychiatric disorders.

A <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_term123" group-by="m">mutation</span> is a sudden, permanent change in a gene. While many mutations can be harmful or lethal, once in a while, a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who do not have the mutation. Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to their particular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations. In order for this process to occur, there must be competition&#x2014;more technically, there must be variability in genes (and resultant traits) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment. If a population consisted of identical individuals, then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way, and there would be no variation in selection. In contrast, diversity in genes and associated traits allows some individuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change. This creates a distinct advantage for individuals best suited for their environments in terms of successful reproduction and genetic transmission. </p>

Later in this course you will learn about social psychology and issues of race, prejudice, and discrimination. When we focus strictly on biology, race becomes a weak construct. After the sequencing of the human genome at the turn of the millennium, many scientists began to argue that race was not a useful variable in genetic research and that its continued use represents a potential source of confusion and harm. The racial categories that some believed to be helpful in studying genetic diversity in humans are largely irrelevant. A person's skin tone, eye color, and hair texture are functions of their genetic makeups, but there is actually more genetic variation within a given racial category than there is between racial categories. In some cases, focus on race has led to difficulties with misdiagnoses and/or under-diagnoses of diseases ranging from sickle cell anemia to cystic fibrosis. Some argue that we need to distinguish between ancestry and race and then focus on ancestry. This approach would facilitate greater understanding of human genetic diversity (Yudell, Roberts, DeSalle, &amp; Tishkoff, 2016).</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Gene-Environment Interactions</h3>
          <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1464880">Genes do not exist in a vacuum. Although we are all biological organisms, we also exist in an environment that is incredibly important in determining not only when and how our genes express themselves, but also in what combination. Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment; range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_term124" group-by="R">Range of reaction</span> asserts that our genes set the boundaries within which we can operate, and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in that range we will fall. For example, if an individual&#x2019;s genetic makeup predisposes her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is reared in a rich, stimulating environment, then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant deprivation. According to the concept of range of reaction, genes set definite limits on potential, and environment determines how much of that potential is achieved. Some disagree with this theory and argue that genes do not set a limit on a person&#x2019;s potential with reaction norms being determined by the environment. For example, when individuals experience neglect or abuse early in life, they are more likely to exhibit adverse psychological and/or physical conditions that can last throughout their lives. These conditions may develop as a function of the negative environmental experiences in individuals from dissimilar genetic backgrounds (Miguel, Pereira, Silveira, &amp; Meaney, 2019; Short &amp; Baram, 2019).</p>
          <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1469712">Another perspective on the interaction between genes and the environment is the concept of <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_term125" group-by="g">genetic environmental correlation</span>. Stated simply, our genes influence our environment, and our environment influences the expression of our genes (<a href="#auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_CNX_Psych_03_01_GeneEnviro" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.7</a>). Not only do our genes and environment interact, as in range of reaction, but they also influence one another bidirectionally. For example, the child of an NBA player would probably be exposed to basketball from an early age. Such exposure might allow the child to realize his or her full genetic, athletic potential. Thus, the parents&#x2019; genes, which the child shares, influence the child&#x2019;s environment, and that environment, in turn, is well suited to support the child&#x2019;s genetic potential.</p>

In other words, researchers study how the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes. As mentioned earlier, gene expression is often influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious. For instance, identical twins share the same genetic information (<span data-type="term" id="auto_page_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_term127" group-by="i">identical twins</span> develop from a single fertilized egg that split, so the genetic material is exactly the same in each; in contrast, <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_term128" group-by="f">fraternal twins</span> usually result from two different eggs fertilized by different sperm, so the genetic material varies as with non-twin siblings). But even with identical genes, there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of each twin&#x2019;s life. Sometimes, one twin will develop a disease and the other will not. In one example, Aliya, an identical twin, died from cancer at age 7, but her twin, now 19 years old, has never had cancer. Although these individuals share an identical genotype, their phenotypes differ as a result of how that genetic information is expressed over time and through their unique environmental interactions. The epigenetic perspective is very different from range of reaction, because here the genotype is not fixed and limited.</p>

Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to a number of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality (for examples, see Mustanski et al., 2005; Comings, Gonzales, Saucier, Johnson, &amp; MacMurray, 2000). Genes are also associated with temperament and a number of psychological disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. So while it is true that genes provide the biological blueprints for our cells, tissues, organs, and body, they also have a significant impact on our experiences and our behaviors.</p>
          <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1264801">Let&#x2019;s look at the following findings regarding schizophrenia in light of our three views of gene-environment interactions. Which view do you think best explains this evidence? </p>
          <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id590077">In a 2004 study by Tienari and colleagues, of people who were given up for adoption, adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia <em data-effect="italics">and</em> who had been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_term130" group-by="s">schizophrenia</span> or another psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study:</p>
          <ul id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1394855">
            <li>Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in disturbed family environments, 36.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.</li>
            <li>Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in healthy family environments, 5.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.</li>
            <li>Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in disturbed family environments, 5.3% were likely to develop schizophrenia.</li>
            <li>Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in healthy family environments, 4.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1422636">The study shows that adoptees with high genetic risk were most likely to develop schizophrenia if they were raised in disturbed home environments. This research lends credibility to the notion that both genetic vulnerability and environmental stress are necessary for schizophrenia to develop, and that genes alone do not tell the full tale.</p>

Glial cells are traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons, both physically and metabolically. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_term132" group-by="G">Glial cells</span> provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built, help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication, provide insulation to neurons, transport nutrients and waste products, and mediate immune responses. For years, researchers believed that there were many more glial cells than neurons; however, more recent work from Suzanna Herculano-Houzel's laboratory has called this long-standing assumption into question and has provided important evidence that there may be a nearly 1:1 ratio of glia cells to neurons. This is important because it suggests that human brains are more similar to other primate brains than previously thought (Azevedo et al, 2009; Herculano-Houzel, 2012; Herculano-Houzel, 2009). <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_term133" group-by="N">Neurons</span>, on the other hand, serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system.

In some axons, glial cells form a fatty substance known as the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_term142" group-by="m">myelin sheath</span>, which coats the axon and acts as an insulator, increasing the speed at which the signal travels. The myelin sheath is not continuous and there are small gaps that occur down the length of the axon. These gaps in the myelin sheath are known as the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_term143" group-by="N">Nodes of Ranvier</span>. The myelin sheath is crucial for the normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system: the loss of the insulation it provides can be detrimental to normal function. To understand how this works, let&#x2019;s consider an example. PKU, a genetic disorder discussed earlier, causes a reduction in myelin and abnormalities in white matter cortical and subcortical structures. The disorder is associated with a variety of issues including severe cognitive deficits, exaggerated reflexes, and seizures (Anderson &amp; Leuzzi, 2010; Huttenlocher, 2000). Another disorder, multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder, involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout the nervous system. The resulting interference in the electrical signal prevents the quick transmittal of information by neurons and can lead to a number of symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, loss of motor control, and sexual dysfunction. While some treatments may help to modify the course of the disease and manage certain symptoms, there is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p id="auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_fs-id1577995">In healthy individuals, the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons, where synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (<a href="#auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_CNX_Psych_03_02_Synapse" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.9</a>).

          <p id="auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_fs-id1560860">Now that we have learned about the basic structures of the neuron and the role that these structures play in neuronal communication, let&#x2019;s take a closer look at the signal itself&#x2014;how it moves through the neuron and then jumps to the next neuron, where the process is repeated.</p>
          <p id="auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_fs-id1500598">We begin at the neuronal membrane.

The neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate&#x2014;a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different. This difference in charge across the membrane, called the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_term147" group-by="m">membrane potential</span>, provides energy for the signal.</p>
          <p id="auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_fs-id1561065">The electrical charge of the fluids is caused by charged molecules (ions) dissolved in the fluid. The semipermeable nature of the neuronal membrane somewhat restricts the movement of these charged molecules, and, as a result, some of the charged particles tend to become more concentrated either inside or outside the cell.</p>
          <p id="auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_fs-id1470173">Between signals, the neuron membrane&#x2019;s potential is held in a state of readiness, called the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_term148" group-by="r">resting potential</span>. Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cell membrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates. Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are ready to move to areas with a negative charge.</p>
          <p id="auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_fs-id1574264">In the resting state, sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will tend to move into the cell. Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), on the other hand, is more concentrated inside the cell, and will tend to move out of the cell (<a href="#auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_CNX_Psych_03_02_NaKConc" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.10</a>). In addition, the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside, due to the activity of the sodium-potassium pump. This pump actively transports three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions in, creating a net negative charge inside the cell. This provides an additional force on sodium, causing it to move into the cell.</p>

At the peak of the spike, the sodium gates close and the potassium gates open. As positively charged potassium ions leave, the cell quickly begins repolarization. At first, it hyperpolarizes, becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential, and then it levels off, returning to the resting potential.</p>

The electrical signal moves down the axon with the impulses jumping in a leapfrog fashion between the Nodes of Ranvier. The Nodes of Ranvier are natural gaps in the myelin sheath. At each point, some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon, raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions. The action potential moves all the way down the axon in this fashion until reaching the terminal buttons.</p>

In simple terms, this means that an incoming signal from another neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation. There is no in-between, and there is no turning off an action potential once it starts. Think of it like sending an email or a text message. You can think about sending it all you want, but the message is not sent until you hit the send button. Furthermore, once you send the message, there is no stopping it.</p>

Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker, it does not fade away as it travels down the axon. It is this all-or-none property that explains the fact that your brain perceives an injury to a distant body part like your toe as equally painful as one to your nose.</p>
          <p id="auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_fs-id1409574">As noted earlier, when the action potential arrives at the terminal button, the synaptic vesicles release their neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron, and the process repeats itself in the new neuron (assuming the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential). Once the signal is delivered, excess neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft drift away, are broken down into inactive fragments, or are reabsorbed in a process known as <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_term153" group-by="r">reuptake</span>.

Clearing the synapse serves both to provide a clear &#x201C;on&#x201D; and &#x201C;off&#x201D; state between signals and to regulate the production of neurotransmitter (full synaptic vesicles provide signals that no additional neurotransmitters need to be produced).</p>

The movement of the action potential down the length of the axon is an electrical event, and movement of the neurotransmitter across the synaptic space represents the chemical portion of the process. However, there are some specialized connections between neurons that are entirely electrical. In such cases, the neurons are said to communicate via an electrical synapse. In these cases, two neurons physically connect to one another via gap junctions, which allows the current from one cell to pass into the next. There are far fewer electrical synapses in the brain, but those that do exist are much faster than the chemical synapses that have been described above (Connors &amp; Long, 2004).</p>

An <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_term158" group-by="a">antagonist</span>, on the other hand, blocks or impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor. Agonists and antagonists represent drugs that are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person&#x2019;s condition. For example, Parkinson's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder, is associated with low levels of dopamine. Therefore, a common treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease involves using dopamine agonists, which mimic the effects of dopamine by binding to dopamine receptors.</p>
          <p id="auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_fs-id1392288">Certain symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with overactive dopamine neurotransmission. The antipsychotics used to treat these symptoms are antagonists for dopamine&#x2014;they block dopamine&#x2019;s effects by binding its receptors without activating them. Thus, they prevent dopamine released by one neuron from signaling information to adjacent neurons.</p>
          <p id="auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_fs-id1513352">In contrast to agonists and antagonists, which both operate by binding to receptor sites, reuptake inhibitors prevent unused neurotransmitters from being transported back to the neuron. This allows neurotransmitters to remain active in the synaptic cleft for longer durations, increasing their effectiveness. Depression, which has been consistently linked with reduced serotonin levels, is commonly treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). By preventing reuptake, SSRIs strengthen the effect of serotonin, giving it more time to interact with serotonin receptors on dendrites. Common SSRIs on the market today include Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft. The drug LSD is structurally very similar to serotonin, and it affects the same neurons and receptors as serotonin. Psychotropic drugs are not instant solutions for people suffering from psychological disorders. Often, an individual must take a drug for several weeks before seeing improvement, and many psychoactive drugs have significant negative side effects. Furthermore, individuals vary dramatically in how they respond to the drugs. To improve chances for success, it is not uncommon for people receiving pharmacotherapy to undergo psychological and/or behavioral therapies as well. Some research suggests that combining drug therapy with other forms of therapy tends to be more effective than any one treatment alone (for one such example, see March et al., 2007).</p>

          <p id="auto_2c452232-1bb2-4d26-a412-96ee84ff2a89_fs-id1547472">The peripheral nervous system is made up of thick bundles of axons, called nerves, carrying messages back and forth between the CNS and the muscles, organs, and senses in the periphery of the body (i.e., everything outside the CNS). The PNS has two major subdivisions: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.</p>

It is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS; therefore, it consists of motor neurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons, carrying instructions from the CNS to the muscles, are efferent fibers (efferent means &#x201C;moving away from&#x201D;). Sensory neurons, carrying sensory information to the CNS, are afferent fibers (afferent means &#x201C;moving toward&#x201D;). A helpful way to remember this is that <strong data-effect="bold">e</strong>fferent = <strong data-effect="bold">e</strong>xit and <strong data-effect="bold">a</strong>fferent = <strong data-effect="bold">a</strong>rrive. Each nerve is basically a bundle of neurons forming a two-way superhighway, containing thousands of axons, both efferent and afferent.</p>

The activity of this system was adaptive for our ancestors, increasing their chances of survival. Imagine, for example, that one of our early ancestors, out hunting small game, suddenly disturbs a large bear with her cubs. At that moment, his body undergoes a series of changes&#x2014;a direct function of sympathetic activation&#x2014;preparing him to face the threat. His pupils dilate, his heart rate and blood pressure increase, his bladder relaxes, his liver releases glucose, and adrenaline surges into his bloodstream. This constellation of physiological changes, known as the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_2c452232-1bb2-4d26-a412-96ee84ff2a89_term167" group-by="f">fight or flight response</span>, allows the body access to energy reserves and heightened sensory capacity so that it might fight off a threat or run away to safety.</p>

          <p id="auto_2c452232-1bb2-4d26-a412-96ee84ff2a89_fs-id1590023">While it is clear that such a response would be critical for survival for our ancestors, who lived in a world full of real physical threats, many of the high-arousal situations we face in the modern world are more psychological in nature. For example, think about how you feel when you have to stand up and give a presentation in front of a roomful of people, or right before taking a big test. You are in no real physical danger in those situations, and yet you have evolved to respond to a perceived threat with the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_2c452232-1bb2-4d26-a412-96ee84ff2a89_term168" group-by="f">fight or flight</span> response. This kind of response is not nearly as adaptive in the modern world; in fact, we suffer negative health consequences when faced constantly with psychological threats that we can neither fight nor flee. Recent research suggests that an increase in susceptibility to heart disease (Chandola, Brunner, &amp; Marmot, 2006) and impaired function of the immune system (Glaser &amp; Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005) are among the many negative consequences of persistent and repeated exposure to stressful situations. Some of this tendency for stress reactivity can be wired by early experiences of trauma.</p>
          <p id="auto_2c452232-1bb2-4d26-a412-96ee84ff2a89_fs-id1523937">Once the threat has been resolved, the parasympathetic nervous system takes over and returns bodily functions to a relaxed state. Our hunter&#x2019;s heart rate and blood pressure return to normal, his pupils constrict, he regains control of his bladder, and the liver begins to store glucose in the form of glycogen for future use. These restorative processes are associated with activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>

        <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1588487">The brain is a remarkably complex organ comprised of billions of interconnected neurons and glia. It is a bilateral, or two-sided, structure that can be separated into distinct lobes. Each lobe is associated with certain types of functions, but, ultimately, all of the areas of the brain interact with one another to provide the foundation for our thoughts and behaviors. In this section, we discuss the overall organization of the brain and the functions associated with different brain areas, beginning with what can be seen as an extension of the brain, the spinal cord.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">The Spinal Cord</h3>
          <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1405061">It can be said that the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_term169" group-by="s">spinal cord</span> is what connects the brain to the outside world. Because of it, the brain can act. The spinal cord is like a relay station, but a very smart one. It not only routes messages to and from the brain, but it also has its own system of automatic processes, called reflexes. </p>
          <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1484263">The top of the spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that merges with the brain stem, where the basic processes of life are controlled, such as breathing and digestion. In the opposite direction, the spinal cord ends just below the ribs&#x2014;contrary to what we might expect, it does not extend all the way to the base of the spine.</p>
          <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1393511">The spinal cord is functionally organized in 30 segments, corresponding with the vertebrae. Each segment is connected to a specific part of the body through the peripheral nervous system. Nerves branch out from the spine at each vertebra. Sensory nerves bring messages in; motor nerves send messages out to the muscles and organs. Messages travel to and from the brain through every segment.</p>
          <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1513147">Some sensory messages are immediately acted on by the spinal cord, without any input from the brain. Withdrawal from a hot object and the knee jerk are two examples. When a sensory message meets certain parameters, the spinal cord initiates an automatic reflex. The signal passes from the sensory nerve to a simple processing center, which initiates a motor command. Seconds are saved, because messages don&#x2019;t have to go the brain, be processed, and get sent back. In matters of survival, the spinal reflexes allow the body to react extraordinarily fast.</p>
          <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1729336">The spinal cord is protected by bony vertebrae and cushioned in cerebrospinal fluid, but injuries still occur. When the spinal cord is damaged in a particular segment, all lower segments are cut off from the brain, causing paralysis. Therefore, the lower on the spine damage occurs, the fewer functions an injured individual will lose.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">Neuroplasticity</h4>

As a consequence of these injuries, Woodruff experienced many cognitive deficits including difficulties with memory and language. However, over time and with the aid of intensive amounts of cognitive and speech therapy, Woodruff has shown an incredible recovery of function (Fernandez, 2008, October 16).</p>
            <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_zip-idm244252208">One of the factors that made this recovery possible was <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_term170" group-by="n">neuroplasticity</span>. Neuroplasticity refers to how the nervous system can change and adapt. Neuroplasticity can occur in a variety of ways including personal experiences, developmental processes, or, as in Woodruff's case, in response to some sort of damage or injury that has occurred. Neuroplasticity can involve creation of new synapses, pruning of synapses that are no longer used, changes in glial cells, and even the birth of new neurons. Because of neuroplasticity, our brains are constantly changing and adapting, and while our nervous system is most plastic when we are very young, as Woodruff's case suggests, it is still capable of remarkable changes later in life.</p>

The left hemisphere controls the right half of the body, and the right hemisphere controls the left half of the body. Decades of research on lateralization of function by Michael Gazzaniga and his colleagues suggest that a variety of functions ranging from cause-and-effect reasoning to self-recognition may follow patterns that suggest some degree of hemispheric dominance (Gazzaniga, 2005). For example, the left hemisphere has been shown to be superior for forming associations in memory, selective attention, and positive emotions. The right hemisphere, on the other hand, has been shown to be superior in pitch perception, arousal, and negative emotions (Ehret, 2006). However, it should be pointed out that research on which hemisphere is dominant in a variety of different behaviors has produced inconsistent results, and therefore, it is probably better to think of how the two hemispheres interact to produce a given behavior rather than attributing certain behaviors to one hemisphere versus the other (Banich &amp; Heller, 1998).</p>
          <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1291863">The two hemispheres are connected by a thick band of neural fibers known as the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_term177" group-by="c">corpus callosum</span>, consisting of about 200 million axons. The corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres to communicate with each other and allows for information being processed on one side of the brain to be shared with the other side.</p>
          <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1410562">Normally, we are not aware of the different roles that our two hemispheres play in day-to-day functions, but there are people who come to know the capabilities and functions of their two hemispheres quite well. In some cases of severe epilepsy, doctors elect to sever the corpus callosum as a means of controlling the spread of seizures (<a href="#auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_CNX_Psych_03_04_CorpusCall" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.16</a>). While this is an effective treatment option, it results in individuals who have "split brains." After surgery, these split-brain patients show a variety of interesting behaviors. For instance, a split-brain patient is unable to name a picture that is shown in the patient&#x2019;s left visual field because the information is only available in the largely nonverbal right hemisphere. However, they are able to recreate the picture with their left hand, which is also controlled by the right hemisphere. When the more verbal left hemisphere sees the picture that the hand drew, the patient is able to name it (assuming the left hemisphere can interpret what was drawn by the left hand).</p>

For example, researchers study the behavioral changes caused by strokes to learn about the functions of specific brain areas. A stroke, caused by an interruption of blood flow to a region in the brain, causes a loss of brain function in the affected region. The damage can be in a small area, and, if it is, this gives researchers the opportunity to link any resulting behavioral changes to a specific area. The types of deficits displayed after a stroke will be largely dependent on where in the brain the damage occurred.</p>
          <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1445858">Consider Theona, an intelligent, self-sufficient woman, who is 62 years old. Recently, she suffered a stroke in the front portion of her right hemisphere. As a result, she has great difficulty moving her left leg. (As you learned earlier, the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body; also, the brain&#x2019;s main motor centers are located at the front of the head, in the frontal lobe.) Theona has also experienced behavioral changes. For example, while in the produce section of the grocery store, she sometimes eats grapes, strawberries, and apples directly from their bins before paying for them. This behavior&#x2014;which would have been very embarrassing to her before the stroke&#x2014;is consistent with damage in another region in the frontal lobe&#x2014;the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with judgment, reasoning, and impulse control.</p>

For example, Padma was an electrical engineer who was socially active and a caring, involved parent. About twenty years ago, she was in a car accident and suffered damage to her Broca&#x2019;s area. She completely lost the ability to speak and form any kind of meaningful language. There is nothing wrong with her mouth or her vocal cords, but she is unable to produce words. She can follow directions but can&#x2019;t respond verbally, and she can read but no longer write. She can do routine tasks like running to the market to buy milk, but she could not communicate verbally if a situation called for it.</p>
            <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1396363">Probably the most famous case of frontal lobe damage is that of a man by the name of Phineas <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_term183" group-by="G">Gage</span>. On September 13, 1848, Gage (age 25) was working as a railroad foreman in Vermont. He and his crew were using an iron rod to tamp explosives down into a blasting hole to remove rock along the railway&#x2019;s path. Unfortunately, the iron rod created a spark and caused the rod to explode out of the blasting hole, into Gage&#x2019;s face, and through his skull (<a href="#auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_CNX_Psych_03_04_GageSkull" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.19</a>). Although lying in a pool of his own blood with brain matter emerging from his head, Gage was conscious and able to get up, walk, and speak. But in the months following his accident, people noticed that his personality had changed. Many of his friends described him as no longer being himself. Before the accident, it was said that Gage was a well-mannered, soft-spoken man, but he began to behave in odd and inappropriate ways after the accident. Such changes in personality would be consistent with loss of impulse control&#x2014;a frontal lobe function.</p>
            <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_eip-221">Beyond the damage to the frontal lobe itself, subsequent investigations into the rod's path also identified probable damage to pathways between the frontal lobe and other brain structures, including the limbic system. With connections between the planning functions of the frontal lobe and the emotional processes of the limbic system severed, Gage had difficulty controlling his emotional impulses.</p>
            <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_eip-311">However, there is some evidence suggesting that the dramatic changes in Gage&#x2019;s personality were exaggerated and embellished. Gage's case occurred in the midst of a 19<sup>th</sup> century debate over localization&#x2014;regarding whether certain areas of the brain are associated with particular functions. On the basis of extremely limited information about Gage, the extent of his injury, and his life before and after the accident, scientists tended to find support for their own views, on whichever side of the debate they fell (Macmillan, 1999).</p>

The somatosensory cortex is an area of the brain which processes touch and sensation. The somatosensory cortex is fascinating because each different area of the cortex processes sensations from a different part of your body. Furthermore, the larger the surface area of the specific body part and the greater amount of nerves in that body part, the larger the area dedicated to processing sensation from that body part in the somatosensory cortex. For example, fingers take up a lot more space than toes. As you can notice from (<a href="#auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_CNX_Psych_03_04_BrainOrg" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.20</a>), the amount of space to process sensation from fingers is much greater than that of toes.</p>

M.) was a 27-year-old man who experienced severe seizures. In an attempt to control his seizures, H. M. underwent brain surgery to remove his hippocampus and amygdala. Following the surgery, H.M&#x2019;s seizures became much less severe, but he also suffered some unexpected&#x2014;and devastating&#x2014;consequences of the surgery: he lost his ability to form many types of new memories. For example, he was unable to learn new facts, such as who was president of the United States. He was able to learn new skills, but afterward he had no recollection of learning them. For example, while he might learn to use a computer, he would have no conscious memory of ever having used one. He could not remember new faces, and he was unable to remember events, even immediately after they occurred. Researchers were fascinated by his experience, and he is considered one of the most studied cases in medical and psychological history (Hardt, Einarsson, &amp; Nader, 2010; Squire, 2009). Indeed, his case has provided tremendous insight into the role that the hippocampus plays in the consolidation of new learning into explicit memory.</p>

Whose decision should it be to remove a feeding tube? Should medical care costs be a factor?</p>
              <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1313018">On February 25, 1990, a Florida woman named Terri <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_term206" group-by="S">Schiavo</span> went into cardiac arrest, apparently triggered by a bulimic episode. She was eventually revived, but her brain had been deprived of oxygen for a long time. Brain scans indicated that there was no activity in her cerebral cortex, and she suffered from severe and permanent cerebral atrophy. Basically, Schiavo was in a vegetative state. Medical professionals determined that she would never again be able to move, talk, or respond in any way. To remain alive, she required a feeding tube, and there was no chance that her situation would ever improve.</p>
              <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1523529">On occasion, Schiavo&#x2019;s eyes would move, and sometimes she would groan. Despite the doctors&#x2019; insistence to the contrary, her parents believed that these were signs that she was trying to communicate with them.</p>
              <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1362959">After 12 years, Schiavo&#x2019;s husband argued that his wife would not have wanted to be kept alive with no feelings, sensations, or brain activity. Her parents, however, were very much against removing her feeding tube. Eventually, the case made its way to the courts, both in the state of Florida and at the federal level. By 2005, the courts found in favor of Schiavo&#x2019;s husband, and the feeding tube was removed on March 18, 2005. Schiavo died 13 days later.</p>
              <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1426585">Why did Schiavo&#x2019;s eyes sometimes move, and why did she groan? Although the parts of her brain that control thought, voluntary movement, and feeling were completely damaged, her brainstem was still intact. Her medulla and pons maintained her breathing and caused involuntary movements of her eyes and the occasional groans. Over the 15-year period that she was on a feeding tube, Schiavo&#x2019;s medical costs may have topped $7 million (Arnst, 2003).</p>
              <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1293104">These questions were brought to popular conscience decades ago in the case of Terri Schiavo, and they have persisted. In 2013, a 13-year-old girl who suffered complications after tonsil surgery was declared brain dead. There was a battle between her family, who wanted her to remain on life support, and the hospital&#x2019;s policies regarding persons declared brain dead. In another complicated 2013&#x2013;14 case in Texas, a pregnant EMT professional declared brain dead was kept alive for weeks, despite her spouse&#x2019;s directives, which were based on her wishes should this situation arise. In this case, state laws designed to protect an unborn fetus came into consideration until doctors determined the fetus unviable.</p>

An individual receiving a PET scan drinks or is injected with a mildly radioactive substance, called a tracer. Once in the bloodstream, the amount of tracer in any given region of the brain can be monitored. As a brain area becomes more active, more blood flows to that area. A computer monitors the movement of the tracer and creates a rough map of active and inactive areas of the brain during a given behavior. PET scans show little detail, are unable to pinpoint events precisely in time, and require that the brain be exposed to radiation; therefore, this technique has been replaced by the fMRI as an alternative diagnostic tool. However, combined with CT, PET technology is still being used in certain contexts. For example, CT/PET scans allow better imaging of the activity of neurotransmitter receptors and open new avenues in schizophrenia research. In this hybrid CT/PET technology, CT contributes clear images of brain structures, while PET shows the brain&#x2019;s activity.</p>

An array of electrodes is placed around a person&#x2019;s head (<a href="#auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_CNX_Psych_03_04_EEG" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.29</a>). The signals received by the electrodes result in a printout of the electrical activity of his or her brain, or brainwaves, showing both the frequency (number of waves per second) and amplitude (height) of the recorded brainwaves, with an accuracy within milliseconds. Such information is especially helpful to researchers studying sleep patterns among individuals with sleep disorders.</p>

Like neurotransmitters, hormones are chemical messengers that must bind to a receptor in order to send their signal. However, unlike neurotransmitters, which are released in close proximity to cells with their receptors, hormones are secreted into the bloodstream and travel throughout the body, affecting any cells that contain receptors for them. Thus, whereas neurotransmitters&#x2019; effects are localized, the effects of hormones are widespread. Also, hormones are slower to take effect, and tend to be longer lasting.</p>

Imbalances in hormones are related to a number of disorders. This section explores some of the major glands that make up the endocrine system and the hormones secreted by these glands (<a href="#auto_97a0ac4e-f79f-4413-9308-feb05fdecc3b_Table_03_05_01" class="autogenerated-content">Table 3.2</a>).</p>

The pituitary is often referred to as the &#x201C;master gland&#x201D; because its messenger hormones control all the other glands in the endocrine system, although it mostly carries out instructions from the hypothalamus. In addition to messenger hormones, the pituitary also secretes growth hormone, endorphins for pain relief, and a number of key hormones that regulate fluid levels in the body.</p>

In hyperthyroidism, or Grave&#x2019;s disease, the thyroid secretes too much of the hormone thyroxine, causing agitation, bulging eyes, and weight loss. In hypothyroidism, reduced hormone levels cause sufferers to experience tiredness, and they often complain of feeling cold. Fortunately, thyroid disorders are often treatable with medications that help reestablish a balance in the hormones secreted by the thyroid.</p>

              <p id="auto_97a0ac4e-f79f-4413-9308-feb05fdecc3b_fs-id1492682">Although it is against Federal laws and many professional athletic associations (The National Football League, for example) have banned their use, anabolic steroid drugs continue to be used by amateur and professional athletes.  The drugs are believed to enhance athletic performance. Anabolic steroid drugs mimic the effects of the body&#x2019;s own steroid hormones, like testosterone and its derivatives. These drugs have the potential to provide a competitive edge by increasing muscle mass, strength, and endurance, although not all users may experience these results. Moreover, use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) does not come without risks. Anabolic steroid use has been linked with a wide variety of potentially negative outcomes, ranging in severity from largely cosmetic (acne) to life threatening (heart attack). Furthermore, use of these substances can result in profound changes in mood and can increase aggressive behavior (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2001).</p>
              <p id="auto_97a0ac4e-f79f-4413-9308-feb05fdecc3b_fs-id1501227">Baseball player Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod) spent the latter part of his playing career at the center of a media storm regarding his use of illegal PEDs. Rodriguez&#x2019;s performance on the field was unparalleled while using the drugs; his success played a large role in negotiating a contract that made him the highest paid player in professional baseball. A subsequent scandal and suspension tarnished his reputation and, according to a statement he made once retired, cost him over $40 million. Even lower-profile athletes, particularly in cycling and Olympic sports, have been revealed as steroid users. What are your thoughts on athletes and doping? Why or why not should the use of PEDs be banned? What advice would you give an athlete who was considering using PEDs?</p>

          <p id="auto_781cf445-32ee-4d92-ab0d-fe2967ba4803_fs-id1505697">Genes are sequences of DNA that code for a particular trait. Different versions of a gene are called alleles&#x2014;sometimes alleles can be classified as dominant or recessive. A dominant allele always results in the dominant phenotype. In order to exhibit a recessive phenotype, an individual must be homozygous for the recessive allele. Genes affect both physical and psychological characteristics. Ultimately, how and when a gene is expressed, and what the outcome will be&#x2014;in terms of both physical and psychological characteristics&#x2014;is a function of the interaction between our genes and our environments.</p>

          <p id="auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_fs-id1492861">Glia and neurons are the two cell types that make up the nervous system. While glia generally play supporting roles, the communication between neurons is fundamental to all of the functions associated with the nervous system. Neuronal communication is made possible by the neuron&#x2019;s specialized structures. The soma contains the cell nucleus, and the dendrites extend from the soma in tree-like branches. The axon is another major extension of the cell body; axons are often covered by a myelin sheath, which increases the speed of transmission of neural impulses. At the end of the axon are terminal buttons that contain synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitters.</p>
          <p id="auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_fs-id1391663">Neuronal communication is an electrochemical event. The dendrites contain receptors for neurotransmitters released by nearby neurons. If the signals received from other neurons are sufficiently strong, an action potential will travel down the length of the axon to the terminal buttons, resulting in the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Action potentials operate on the all-or-none principle and involve the movement of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> across the neuronal membrane.</p>
          <p id="auto_cec4ceec-8232-473d-b4b7-405524a93eac_fs-id1297762">Different neurotransmitters are associated with different functions. Often, psychological disorders involve imbalances in a given neurotransmitter system. Therefore, psychotropic drugs are prescribed in an attempt to bring the neurotransmitters back into balance. Drugs can act either as agonists or as antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system.</p>

          <p id="auto_2c452232-1bb2-4d26-a412-96ee84ff2a89_fs-id1505796">The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is comprised of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system transmits sensory and motor signals to and from the central nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls the function of our organs and glands, and can be divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Sympathetic activation prepares us for fight or flight, while parasympathetic activation is associated with normal functioning under relaxed conditions.</p>

          <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1313046">The brain consists of two hemispheres, each controlling the opposite side of the body. Each hemisphere can be subdivided into different lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. In addition to the lobes of the cerebral cortex, the forebrain includes the thalamus (sensory relay) and limbic system (emotion and memory circuit). The midbrain contains the reticular formation, which is important for sleep and arousal, as well as the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. These structures are important for movement, reward, and addictive processes. The hindbrain contains the structures of the brainstem (medulla, pons, and midbrain), which control automatic functions like breathing and blood pressure. The hindbrain also contains the cerebellum, which helps coordinate movement and certain types of memories.</p>
          <p id="auto_be055ac9-f86d-41fd-926a-274645c57e1c_fs-id1453549">Individuals with brain damage have been studied extensively to provide information about the role of different areas of the brain, and recent advances in technology allow us to glean similar information by imaging brain structure and function. These techniques include CT, PET, MRI, fMRI, and EEG.</p>

The hypothalamus serves as the interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system, and it controls the secretions of the pituitary. The pituitary serves as the master gland, controlling the secretions of all other glands. The thyroid secretes thyroxine, which is important for basic metabolic processes and growth; the adrenal glands secrete hormones involved in the stress response; the pancreas secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels; and the ovaries and testes produce sex hormones that regulate sexual motivation and behavior.</p>

While awake, we feel alert and aware of the many important things going on around us. Our experiences change dramatically while we are in deep sleep and once again when we are dreaming. Some people also experience altered states of consciousness through meditation, hypnosis, or alcohol and other drugs.</p>

The different stages of sleep will be identified, and sleep disorders will be described.

Beyond being awake or asleep, there are many other states of consciousness people experience. These include daydreaming, intoxication, and unconsciousness due to anesthesia. We might also experience unconscious states of being via drug-induced anesthesia for medical purposes. Often, we are not completely aware of our surroundings, even when we are fully awake. For instance, have you ever daydreamed while driving home from work or school without really thinking about the drive itself? You were capable of engaging in the all of the complex tasks involved with operating a motor vehicle even though you were not aware of doing so. Many of these processes, like much of psychological behavior, are rooted in our biology.</p>

For instance, some people would say they are morning people, while others would consider themselves to be night owls. These individual differences in circadian patterns of activity are known as a person&#x2019;s chronotype, and research demonstrates that morning larks and night owls differ with regard to sleep regulation (Taillard, Philip, Coste, Sagaspe, &amp; Bioulac, 2003). <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_f7244366-506e-4e2c-a183-cf134667d1e2_term231" group-by="S">Sleep regulation</span> refers to the brain&#x2019;s control of switching between sleep and wakefulness as well as coordinating this cycle with the outside world.</p>

One way that this happens involves traveling across multiple time zones. When we do this, we often experience jet lag. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_f7244366-506e-4e2c-a183-cf134667d1e2_term232" group-by="J">Jet lag</span> is a collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment.

For example, a person may work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Monday, 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, and 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday. In such instances, the individual&#x2019;s schedule changes so frequently that it becomes difficult for a normal circadian rhythm to be maintained. This often results in sleeping problems, and it can lead to signs of depression and anxiety. These kinds of schedules are common for individuals working in health care professions and service industries, and they are associated with persistent feelings of exhaustion and agitation that can make someone more prone to making mistakes on the job (Gold et al., 1992; Presser, 1995).</p>

Some of these approaches, such as using a bright light as shown in <a href="#auto_f7244366-506e-4e2c-a183-cf134667d1e2_Figure_04_01_BrightLight" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 4.4</a>, have been shown to alleviate some of the problems experienced by individuals suffering from jet lag or from the consequences of rotating shift work. Because the biological clock is driven by light, exposure to bright light during working shifts and dark exposure when not working can help combat insomnia and symptoms of anxiety and depression (Huang, Tsai, Chen, &amp; Hsu, 2013). </p>

While we certainly welcome the convenience of having the darkness lit up, we also suffer the consequences of reduced amounts of sleep because we are more active during the nighttime hours than our ancestors were. As a result, many of us sleep less than 7&#x2013;8 hours a night and accrue a sleep debt. While there is tremendous variation in any given individual&#x2019;s sleep needs, the National Sleep Foundation (n.d.) cites research to estimate that newborns require the most sleep (between 12 and 18 hours a night) and that this amount declines to just 7&#x2013;9 hours by the time we are adults.</p>

Given that college students are notorious for suffering from significant sleep debt (Hicks, Fernandez, &amp; Pellegrini, 2001; Hicks, Johnson, &amp; Pellegrini, 1992; Miller, Shattuck, &amp; Matsangas, 2010), chances are you and your classmates deal with sleep debt-related issues on a regular basis. In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation updated their sleep duration hours, to better accommodate individual differences. <a href="#auto_f7244366-506e-4e2c-a183-cf134667d1e2_Table_04_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">Table 4.1</a> shows the new recommendations, which describe sleep durations that are &#x201C;recommended&#x201D;, &#x201C;may be appropriate&#x201D;, and &#x201C;not recommended&#x201D;.</p>

As mentioned earlier, lack of sleep can result in decreased mental alertness and cognitive function. In addition, sleep deprivation often results in depression-like symptoms. These effects can occur as a function of accumulated sleep debt or in response to more acute periods of sleep deprivation. It may surprise you to know that sleep deprivation is associated with obesity, increased blood pressure, increased levels of stress hormones, and reduced immune functioning (Banks &amp; Dinges, 2007). A sleep deprived individual generally will fall asleep more quickly than if she were not sleep deprived.  Some sleep-deprived individuals have difficulty staying awake when they stop moving (example sitting and watching television or driving a car). That is why individuals suffering from sleep deprivation can also put themselves and others at risk when they put themselves behind the wheel of a car or work with dangerous machinery. Some research suggests that sleep deprivation affects cognitive and motor function as much as, if not more than, alcohol intoxication (Williamson &amp; Feyer, 2000). Research shows that the most severe effects of sleep deprivation occur when a person stays awake for more than 24 hours (Killgore &amp; Weber, 2014; Killgore et al., 2007), or following repeated nights with fewer than four hours in bed (Wickens, Hutchins, Lauk, Seebook, 2015). For example, irritability, distractibility, and impairments in cognitive and moral judgment can occur with fewer than four hours of sleep. If someone stays awake for 48 consecutive hours, they could start to hallucinate. </p>

Given the average life expectancy for U.S. citizens falls between 73 and 79 years old (Singh &amp; Siahpush, 2006), we can expect to spend approximately 25 years of our lives sleeping. Some animals never sleep (e.g., some fish and amphibian species); other animals sleep very little without apparent negative consequences (e.g., giraffes); yet some animals (e.g., rats) die after two weeks of sleep deprivation (Siegel, 2008). Why do we devote so much time to sleeping? Is it absolutely essential that we sleep? This section will consider these questions and explore various explanations for why we sleep.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">What is Sleep?</h3>
          <p id="auto_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_fs-idm114914880">You have read that sleep is distinguished by low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness. As discussed by Siegel (2008), a definition of sleep must also include mention of the interplay of the circadian and homeostatic mechanisms that regulate sleep. Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound following sleep deprivation. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_term237" group-by="S">Sleep rebound</span> refers to the fact that a sleep-deprived individual will fall asleep more quickly during subsequent opportunities for sleep. Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity of the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography (EEG), and different phases of sleep can be differentiated using EEG as well.</p>
          <p id="auto_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_fs-idm62464416">Sleep-wake cycles seem to be controlled by multiple brain areas acting in conjunction with one another. Some of these areas include the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the pons. As already mentioned, the hypothalamus contains the SCN&#x2014;the biological clock of the body&#x2014;in addition to other nuclei that, in conjunction with the thalamus, regulate slow-wave sleep. The pons is important for regulating rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (National Institutes of Health, n.d.).</p>
          <p id="auto_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_fs-idm47336816">Sleep is also associated with the secretion and regulation of a number of hormones from several endocrine glands including: melatonin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and growth hormone (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). You have read that the pineal gland releases melatonin during sleep (<a href="#auto_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_Figure_04_02_Pituitary" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 4.6</a>). Melatonin is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and the immune system (Hardeland et al., 2006). During sleep, the pituitary gland secretes both FSH and LH which are important in regulating the reproductive system (Christensen et al., 2012; Sofikitis et al., 2008). The pituitary gland also secretes growth hormone, during sleep, which plays a role in physical growth and maturation as well as other metabolic processes (Bartke, Sun, &amp; Longo, 2013).</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Why Do We Sleep?</h3>
          <p id="auto_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_fs-idm148663456">Given the central role that sleep plays in our lives and the number of adverse consequences that have been associated with sleep deprivation, one would think that we would have a clear understanding of why it is that we sleep. Unfortunately, this is not the case; however, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of sleep.</p>
          <section data-depth="2" id="auto_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_fs-idm143295568">
            <h4 data-type="title">Adaptive Function of Sleep</h4>
            <p id="auto_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_fs-idm88914576">One popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_term238" group-by="E">Evolutionary psychology</span> is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have evolved over time as a result of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_term239" group-by="n">natural selection</span>. Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring. One hypothesis from this perspective might argue that sleep is essential to restore resources that are expended during the day. Just as bears hibernate in the winter when resources are scarce, perhaps people sleep at night to reduce their energy expenditures. While this is an intuitive explanation of sleep, there is little research that supports this explanation. In fact, it has been suggested that there is no reason to think that energetic demands could not be addressed with periods of rest and inactivity (Frank, 2006; Rial et al., 2007), and some research has actually found a negative correlation between energetic demands and the amount of time spent sleeping (Capellini, Barton, McNamara, Preston, &amp; Nunn, 2008).</p>
            <p id="auto_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_fs-idm118926432">Another evolutionary hypothesis of sleep holds that our sleep patterns evolved as an adaptive response to predatory risks, which increase in darkness. Thus we sleep in safe areas to reduce the chance of harm. Again, this is an intuitive and appealing explanation for why we sleep. Perhaps our ancestors spent extended periods of time asleep to reduce attention to themselves from potential predators. Comparative research indicates, however, that the relationship that exists between predatory risk and sleep is very complex and equivocal. Some research suggests that species that face higher predatory risks sleep fewer hours than other species (Capellini et al., 2008), while other researchers suggest there is no relationship between the amount of time a given species spends in deep sleep and its predation risk (Lesku, Roth, Amlaner, &amp; Lima, 2006).</p>
            <p id="auto_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_fs-idm95110192">It is quite possible that sleep serves no single universally adaptive function, and different species have evolved different patterns of sleep in response to their unique evolutionary pressures. While we have discussed the negative outcomes associated with sleep deprivation, it should be pointed out that there are many benefits that are associated with adequate amounts of sleep. A few such benefits listed by the National Sleep Foundation (n.d.) include maintaining healthy weight, lowering stress levels, improving mood, and increasing motor coordination, as well as a number of benefits related to cognition and memory formation.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">Cognitive Function of Sleep</h4>
            <p id="auto_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_fs-idm28237616">Another theory regarding why we sleep involves sleep&#x2019;s importance for cognitive function and memory formation (Rattenborg, Lesku, Martinez-Gonzalez, &amp; Lima, 2007). Indeed, we know sleep deprivation results in disruptions in cognition and memory deficits (Brown, 2012), leading to impairments in our abilities to maintain attention, make decisions, and recall long-term memories. Moreover, these impairments become more severe as the amount of sleep deprivation increases (Alhola &amp; Polo-Kantola, 2007). Furthermore, slow-wave sleep after learning a new task can improve resultant performance on that task (Huber, Ghilardi, Massimini, &amp; Tononi, 2004) and seems essential for effective memory formation (Stickgold, 2005). Understanding the impact of sleep on cognitive function should help you understand that cramming all night for a test may be not effective and can even prove counterproductive.</p>

Research indicates that included among these possible benefits are increased capacities for creative thinking (Cai, Mednick, Harrison, Kanady, &amp; Mednick, 2009; Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger, &amp; Born, 2004), language learning (Fenn, Nusbaum, &amp; Margoliash, 2003; G&#xF3;mez, Bootzin, &amp; Nadel, 2006), and inferential judgments (Ellenbogen, Hu, Payne, Titone, &amp; Walker, 2007). It is possible that even the processing of emotional information is influenced by certain aspects of sleep (Walker, 2009).</p>

Instead, sleep is composed of several different stages that can be differentiated from one another by the patterns of brain wave activity that occur during each stage. While awake, our brain wave activity is dominated by <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_term240" group-by="b">beta waves</span>. As compared to the brain wave patterns while asleep, beta waves have the highest frequency (13&#x2013;30 Hz) and lowest amplitude, and they tend to show more variability. As we begin to fall asleep, our brain wave activity changes. These changes can be visualized using an EEG and are distinguished from one another by both the frequency and amplitude of the brain wave. The frequency of a brain wave is how many brain waves occur in a second, and frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). Amplitude is the height of the brain wave (<a href="#auto_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_Figure_04_03_SleepCycle" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 4.7</a>).

The brain waves associated with this stage of sleep are very similar to those observed when a person is awake, as shown in <a href="#auto_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_Figure_04_03_REM" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 4.11</a>, and this is the period of sleep in which dreaming occurs. It is also associated with paralysis of muscle systems in the body with the exception of those that make circulation and respiration possible. Therefore, no movement of voluntary muscles occurs during REM sleep in a normal individual; REM sleep is often referred to as paradoxical sleep because of this combination of high brain activity and lack of muscle tone. Like NREM sleep, REM has been implicated in various aspects of learning and memory (Wagner, Gais, &amp; Born, 2001; Siegel, 2001).</p>

This is known as the REM rebound, and it suggests that REM sleep is also homeostatically regulated. Aside from the role that REM sleep may play in processes related to learning and memory, REM sleep may also be involved in emotional processing and regulation. In such instances, REM rebound may actually represent an adaptive response to stress in nondepressed individuals by suppressing the emotional salience of aversive events that occurred in wakefulness (Suchecki, Tiba, &amp; Machado, 2012). Sleep deprivation in general is associated with a number of negative consequences (Brown, 2012).</p>

            <p id="auto_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_fs-idm31249056">Dreams and their associated meanings vary across different cultures and periods of time. By the late 19th century, Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_term251" group-by="F">Freud</span> had become convinced that dreams represented an opportunity to gain access to the unconscious. By analyzing dreams, Freud thought people could increase self-awareness and gain valuable insight to help them deal with the problems they faced in their lives. Freud made distinctions between the manifest content and the latent content of dreams. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_term252" group-by="M">Manifest content</span> is the actual content, or storyline, of a dream. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_term253" group-by="L">Latent content</span>, on the other hand, refers to the hidden meaning of a dream. For instance, if a woman dreams about being chased by a snake, Freud might have argued that this represents the woman&#x2019;s fear of sexual intimacy, with the snake serving as a symbol of a man&#x2019;s penis.</p>
            <p id="auto_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_fs-idm29982832">Freud was not the only theorist to focus on the content of dreams. The 20th century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung believed that dreams allowed us to tap into the collective unconscious. The <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_term254" group-by="c">collective unconscious</span>, as described by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_term255" group-by="J">Jung</span>, is a theoretical repository of information he believed to be shared by everyone. According to Jung, certain symbols in dreams reflected universal archetypes with meanings that are similar for all people regardless of culture or location.</p>
            <p id="auto_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_fs-idm29876928">The sleep and dreaming researcher Rosalind Cartwright, however, believes that dreams simply reflect life events that are important to the dreamer. Unlike Freud and Jung, Cartwright&#x2019;s ideas about dreaming have found empirical support. For example, she and her colleagues published a study in which women going through divorce were asked several times over a five month period to report the degree to which their former spouses were on their minds. These same women were awakened during REM sleep in order to provide a detailed account of their dream content. There was a significant positive correlation between the degree to which women thought about their former spouses during waking hours and the number of times their former spouses appeared as characters in their dreams (Cartwright, Agargun, Kirkby, &amp; Friedman, 2006). Recent research (Horikawa, Tamaki, Miyawaki, &amp; Kamitani, 2013) has uncovered new techniques by which researchers may effectively detect and classify the visual images that occur during dreaming by using fMRI for neural measurement of brain activity patterns, opening the way for additional research in this area.</p>
            <p id="auto_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_fs-idp61673568">Alan Hobson, a neuroscientist, is credited for developing activation-synthesis theory of dreaming. Early versions of this theory proposed that dreams were not the meaning-filled representations of angst proposed by Freud and others, but were rather the result of our brain attempting to make sense of ("synthesize") the neural activity ("activation") that was happening during REM sleep. Recent adaptations (e.g., Hobson, 2002) continue to update the theory based on accumulating evidence. For example, Hobson (2009) suggests that dreaming may represent a state of protoconsciousness. In other words, dreaming involves constructing a virtual reality in our heads that we might use to help us during wakefulness. Among a variety of neurobiological evidence, John Hobson cites research on lucid dreams as an opportunity to better understand dreaming in general. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_fea79b76-b417-40e2-8ab8-35161b0c4f3e_term256" group-by="L">Lucid dreams</span> are dreams in which certain aspects of wakefulness are maintained during a dream state. In a lucid dream, a person becomes aware of the fact that they are dreaming, and as such, they can control the dream&#x2019;s content (LaBerge, 1990).</p>

Depending on the population and sleep disorder being studied, between 30% and 50% of the population suffers from a sleep disorder at some point in their lives (Bixler, Kales, Soldatos, Kaels, &amp; Healey, 1979; Hossain &amp; Shapiro, 2002; Ohayon, 1997, 2002; Ohayon &amp; Roth, 2002). This section will describe several sleep disorders as well as some of their treatment options.</p>
        <section data-depth="1" id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp205968480">
          <h3 data-type="title">Insomnia</h3>
          <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp206765840">Insomnia, a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep, is the most common of the sleep disorders. Individuals with insomnia often experience long delays between the times that they go to bed and actually fall asleep. In addition, these individuals may wake up several times during the night only to find that they have difficulty getting back to sleep. As mentioned earlier, one of the criteria for insomnia involves experiencing these symptoms for at least three nights a week for at least one month&#x2019;s time (Roth, 2007).</p>
          <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp149241920">It is not uncommon for people suffering from insomnia to experience increased levels of anxiety about their inability to fall asleep. This becomes a self-perpetuating cycle because increased anxiety leads to increased arousal, and higher levels of arousal make the prospect of falling asleep even more unlikely. Chronic insomnia is almost always associated with feeling overtired and may be associated with symptoms of depression.</p>
          <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp208253280">There may be many factors that contribute to insomnia, including age, drug use, exercise, mental status, and bedtime routines. Not surprisingly, insomnia treatment may take one of several different approaches. People who suffer from insomnia might limit their use of stimulant drugs (such as caffeine) or increase their amount of physical exercise during the day. Some people might turn to over-the-counter (OTC) or prescribed sleep medications to help them sleep, but this should be done sparingly because many sleep medications result in dependence and alter the nature of the sleep cycle, and they can increase insomnia over time. Those who continue to have insomnia, particularly if it affects their quality of life, should seek professional treatment.</p>
          <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp120601200">Some forms of psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, can help sufferers of insomnia. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_term257" group-by="C">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</span> is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on cognitive processes and problem behaviors. The treatment of insomnia likely would include stress management techniques and changes in problematic behaviors that could contribute to insomnia (e.g., spending more waking time in bed). Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been demonstrated to be quite effective in treating insomnia (Savard, Simard, Ivers, &amp; Morin, 2005; Williams, Roth, Vatthauer, &amp; McCrae, 2013).</p>

My sophomore college housemate got so stressed out during finals sophomore year he drank almost a whole bottle of Nyquil to try to fall asleep. When he told me, I made him go see the college therapist.</p>
              <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_zip-idm331759808">Many college students struggle getting the recommended 7&#x2013;9 hours of sleep each night. However, for some, it's not because of all-night partying or late-night study sessions. It's simply that they feel so overwhelmed and stressed that they cannot fall asleep or stay asleep. One or two nights of sleep difficulty is not unusual, but if you experience anything more than that, you should seek a doctor's advice.</p>
              <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_zip-idm296147776">Here are some tips to maintain healthy sleep:</p>
              <ul id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_zip-idm287756192">
                <li>Stick to a sleep schedule, even on the weekends. Try going to bed and waking up at the same time every day to keep your biological clock in sync so your body gets in the habit of sleeping every night.</li>
                <li>Avoid anything stimulating for an hour before bed. That includes exercise and bright light from devices.</li>
                <li>Exercise daily.</li>
                <li>Avoid naps.</li>
                <li>Keep your bedroom temperature between 60 and 67 degrees. People sleep better in cooler temperatures.</li>
                <li>Avoid alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine, and heavy meals before bed. It may feel like alcohol helps you sleep, but it actually disrupts REM sleep and leads to frequent awakenings. Heavy meals may make you sleepy, but they can also lead to frequent awakenings due to gastric distress.</li>
                <li>If you cannot fall asleep, leave your bed and do something else until you feel tired again. Train your body to associate the bed with sleeping rather than other activities like studying, eating, or watching television shows.</li>

Parasomnias can occur in either REM or NREM phases of sleep. Sleepwalking, restless leg syndrome, and night terrors are all examples of parasomnias (Mahowald &amp; Schenck, 2000).</p>

During periods of sleepwalking, sleepers often have their eyes open, but they are not responsive to attempts to communicate with them. Sleepwalking most often occurs during slow-wave sleep, but it can occur at any time during a sleep period in some affected individuals (Mahowald &amp; Schenck, 2000).</p>
            <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp171995984">Historically, somnambulism has been treated with a variety of pharmacotherapies ranging from benzodiazepines to antidepressants. However, the success rate of such treatments is questionable. Guilleminault et al. (2005) found that sleepwalking was not alleviated with the use of benzodiazepines. However, all of their somnambulistic patients who also suffered from sleep-related breathing problems showed a marked decrease in sleepwalking when their breathing problems were effectively treated.</p>

After dinner, he prepared some materials to use in leading a church youth group the following morning, and then he attempted to repair the family&#x2019;s swimming pool pump before retiring to bed. The following morning, he awoke to barking dogs and unfamiliar voices from downstairs. As he went to investigate what was going on, he was met by a group of police officers who arrested him for the murder of his wife (Cartwright, 2004; CNN, 1999).</p>
                <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idm37642464">Yarmila Falater&#x2019;s body was found in the family&#x2019;s pool with 44 stab wounds. A neighbor called the police after witnessing Falater standing over his wife&#x2019;s body before dragging her into the pool. Upon a search of the premises, police found blood-stained clothes and a bloody knife in the trunk of Falater&#x2019;s car, and he had blood stains on his neck.</p>
                <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp22750000">Remarkably, Falater insisted that he had no recollection of hurting his wife in any way. His children and his wife&#x2019;s parents all agreed that Falater had an excellent relationship with his wife and they couldn&#x2019;t think of a reason that would provide any sort of motive to murder her (Cartwright, 2004).</p>
                <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp84150624">Scott Falater had a history of regular episodes of sleepwalking as a child, and he had even behaved violently toward his sister once when she tried to prevent him from leaving their home in his pajamas during a sleepwalking episode. He suffered from no apparent anatomical brain anomalies or psychological disorders. It appeared that Scott Falater had killed his wife in his sleep, or at least, that is the defense he used when he was tried for his wife&#x2019;s murder (Cartwright, 2004; CNN, 1999). In Falater&#x2019;s case, a jury found him guilty of first degree murder in June of 1999 (CNN, 1999); however, there are other murder cases where the sleepwalking defense has been used successfully. As scary as it sounds, many sleep researchers believe that homicidal sleepwalking is possible in individuals suffering from the types of sleep disorders described below (Broughton et al., 1994; Cartwright, 2004; Mahowald, Schenck, &amp; Cramer Bornemann, 2005; Pressman, 2007). </p>

Individuals who suffer from RBD have high levels of physical activity during REM sleep, especially during disturbing dreams. These behaviors vary widely, but they can include kicking, punching, scratching, yelling, and behaving like an animal that has been frightened or attacked. People who suffer from this disorder can injure themselves or their sleeping partners when engaging in these behaviors. Furthermore, these types of behaviors ultimately disrupt sleep, although affected individuals have no memories that these behaviors have occurred (Arnulf, 2012).</p>
            <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp117390336">This disorder is associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#x2019;s disease. In fact, this relationship is so robust that some view the presence of RBD as a potential aid in the diagnosis and treatment of a number of neurodegenerative diseases (Ferini-Strambi, 2011). Clonazepam, an anti-anxiety medication with sedative properties, is most often used to treat RBD. It is administered alone or in conjunction with doses of melatonin (the hormone secreted by the pineal gland). As part of treatment, the sleeping environment is often modified to make it a safer place for those suffering from RBD (Zangini, Calandra-Buonaura, Grimaldi, &amp; Cortelli, 2011).</p>

This discomfort is relieved by deliberately moving the legs, which, not surprisingly, contributes to difficulty in falling or staying asleep. Restless leg syndrome is quite common and has been associated with a number of other medical diagnoses, such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes (Mahowald &amp; Schenck, 2000). There are a variety of drugs that treat restless leg syndrome: benzodiazepines, opiates, and anticonvulsants (Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation, n.d.).</p>

Although individuals suffering from night terrors appear to be awake, they generally have no memories of the events that occurred, and attempts to console them are ineffective. Typically, individuals suffering from night terrors will fall back asleep again within a short time. Night terrors apparently occur during the NREM phase of sleep (Provini, Tinuper, Bisulli, &amp; Lagaresi, 2011). Generally, treatment for night terrors is unnecessary unless there is some underlying medical or psychological condition that is contributing to the night terrors (Mayo Clinic, n.d.).</p>

These episodes can last 10&#x2013;20 seconds or longer and often are associated with brief periods of arousal. While individuals suffering from sleep apnea may not be aware of these repeated disruptions in sleep, they do experience increased levels of fatigue. Many individuals diagnosed with sleep apnea first seek treatment because their sleeping partners indicate that they snore loudly and/or stop breathing for extended periods of time while sleeping (Henry &amp; Rosenthal, 2013). Sleep apnea is much more common in overweight people and is often associated with loud snoring. Surprisingly, sleep apnea may exacerbate cardiovascular disease (S&#xE1;nchez-de-la-Torre, Campos-Rodriguez, &amp; Barb&#xE9;, 2012). While sleep apnea is less common in thin people, anyone, regardless of their weight, who snores loudly or gasps for air while sleeping, should be checked for sleep apnea.</p>
          <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp258511968">While people are often unaware of their sleep apnea, they are keenly aware of some of the adverse consequences of insufficient sleep. Consider a patient who believed that as a result of his sleep apnea he &#x201C;had three car accidents in six weeks. They were ALL my fault. Two of them I didn&#x2019;t even know I was involved in until afterwards&#x201D; (Henry &amp; Rosenthal, 2013, p. 52). It is not uncommon for people suffering from undiagnosed or untreated sleep apnea to fear that their careers will be affected by the lack of sleep, illustrated by this statement from another patient, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m in a job where there&#x2019;s a premium on being mentally alert. I was really sleepy&#x2026; and having trouble concentrating&#x2026;. It was getting to the point where it was kind of scary&#x201D; (Henry &amp; Rosenthal, 2013, p. 52).</p>

Some newer CPAP masks are smaller and cover only the nose. This treatment option has proven to be effective for people suffering from mild to severe cases of sleep apnea (McDaid et al., 2009). However, alternative treatment options are being explored because consistent compliance by users of CPAP devices is a problem. Recently, a new EPAP (expiratory positive air pressure) device has shown promise in double-blind trials as one such alternative (Berry, Kryger, &amp; Massie, 2011).</p>

Infants younger than 12 months appear to be at the highest risk for SIDS, and boys have a greater risk than girls. A number of risk factors have been associated with SIDS including premature birth, smoking within the home, and hyperthermia. There may also be differences in both brain structure and function in infants that die from SIDS (Berkowitz, 2012; Mage &amp; Donner, 2006; Thach, 2005).</p>

For one, research suggests that infants should be placed on their backs when put down to sleep, and their cribs should not contain any items which pose suffocation threats, such as blankets, pillows or padded crib bumpers (cushions that cover the bars of a crib). Infants should not have caps placed on their heads when put down to sleep in order to prevent overheating, and people in the child&#x2019;s household should abstain from smoking in the home. Recommendations like these have helped to decrease the number of infant deaths from SIDS in recent years (Mitchell, 2009; Task Force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, 2011).</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Narcolepsy</h3>
          <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp50139184">Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section, a person with <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_term268" group-by="n">narcolepsy</span> cannot resist falling asleep at inopportune times. These sleep episodes are often associated with <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_term269" group-by="c">cataplexy</span>, which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness, and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles. This is similar to the kind of paralysis experienced by healthy individuals during REM sleep (Burgess &amp; Scammell, 2012; Hishikawa &amp; Shimizu, 1995; Luppi et al., 2011). Narcoleptic episodes take on other features of REM sleep. For example, around one third of individuals diagnosed with narcolepsy experience vivid, dream-like hallucinations during narcoleptic attacks (Chokroverty, 2010).</p>
          <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp72735184">Surprisingly, narcoleptic episodes are often triggered by states of heightened arousal or stress. The typical episode can last from a minute or two to half an hour. Once awakened from a narcoleptic attack, people report that they feel refreshed (Chokroverty, 2010). Obviously, regular narcoleptic episodes could interfere with the ability to perform one&#x2019;s job or complete schoolwork, and in some situations, narcolepsy can result in significant harm and injury (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery or other potentially dangerous equipment).</p>
          <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp22315312">Generally, narcolepsy is treated using psychomotor stimulant drugs, such as amphetamines (Mignot, 2012). These drugs promote increased levels of neural activity. Narcolepsy is associated with reduced levels of the signaling molecule hypocretin in some areas of the brain (De la Herr&#xE1;n-Arita &amp; Drucker-Col&#xED;n, 2012; Han, 2012), and the traditional stimulant drugs do not have direct effects on this system. Therefore, it is quite likely that new medications that are developed to treat narcolepsy will be designed to target the hypocretin system.</p>
          <p id="auto_4ffb3e5b-9fb7-46e5-9928-20802d505e38_fs-idp61773584">There is a tremendous amount of variability among sufferers, both in terms of how symptoms of narcolepsy manifest and the effectiveness of currently available treatment options. This is illustrated by McCarty&#x2019;s (2010) case study of a 50-year-old woman who sought help for the excessive sleepiness during normal waking hours that she had experienced for several years. She indicated that she had fallen asleep at inappropriate or dangerous times, including while eating, while socializing with friends, and while driving her car. During periods of emotional arousal, the woman complained that she felt some weakness in the right side of her body. Although she did not experience any dream-like hallucinations, she was diagnosed with narcolepsy as a result of sleep testing. In her case, the fact that her cataplexy was confined to the right side of her body was quite unusual. Early attempts to treat her condition with a stimulant drug alone were unsuccessful. However, when a stimulant drug was used in conjunction with a popular antidepressant, her condition improved dramatically.</p>

Drug use disorders are addictive disorders, and the criteria for specific substance (drug) use disorders are described in DSM-5. A person who has a substance use disorder often uses more of the substance than they originally intended to and continues to use that substance despite experiencing significant adverse consequences. In individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder, there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence.</p>

These symptoms usually are opposite of the effects of the drug. For example, withdrawal from sedative drugs often produces unpleasant arousal and agitation. In addition to withdrawal, many individuals who are diagnosed with substance use disorders will also develop tolerance to these substances. Psychological dependence, or drug craving, is a recent addition to the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder in DSM-5. This is an important factor because we can develop tolerance and experience withdrawal from any number of drugs that we do not abuse. In other words, physical dependence in and of itself is of limited utility in determining whether or not someone has a substance use disorder.</p>

Other depressants include barbiturates and benzodiazepines. These drugs share in common their ability to serve as agonists of the gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system. Because GABA has a quieting effect on the brain, GABA agonists also have a quieting effect; these types of drugs are often prescribed to treat both anxiety and insomnia.</p>

At rather low doses, alcohol use is associated with feelings of euphoria. As the dose increases, people report feeling sedated. Generally, alcohol is associated with decreases in reaction time and visual acuity, lowered levels of alertness, and reduction in behavioral control. With excessive alcohol use, a person might experience a complete loss of consciousness and/or difficulty remembering events that occurred during a period of intoxication (McKim &amp; Hancock, 2013). In addition, if a pregnant woman consumes alcohol, her infant may be born with a cluster of birth defects and symptoms collectively called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).</p>

Psychological dependence on these drugs is also possible. Therefore, the abuse potential of central nervous system depressants is relatively high.</p>

This is of such concern that people who are trying to overcome addiction to these substances should only do so under medical supervision.</p>

Many of these drugs act as agonists of the dopamine neurotransmitter system. Dopamine activity is often associated with reward and craving; therefore, drugs that affect dopamine neurotransmission often have abuse liability. Drugs in this category include cocaine, amphetamines (including methamphetamine), cathinones (i.e., bath salts), MDMA (ecstasy), nicotine, and caffeine.</p>
            <p id="auto_937511e1-4e12-4a50-82de-e55fdcc804bb_fs-idp145377424">Cocaine can be taken in multiple ways. While many users snort cocaine, intravenous injection and inhalation (smoking) are also common. The freebase version of cocaine, known as crack, is a potent, smokable version of the drug. Like many other stimulants, cocaine agonizes the dopamine neurotransmitter system by blocking the reuptake of dopamine in the neuronal synapse.</p>

The smokable form reaches the brain very quickly to produce an intense euphoria that dissipates almost as fast as it arrives, prompting users to continuing taking the drug. Users often consume the drug every few hours across days-long binges called "runs," in which the user forgoes food and sleep. The availability of potent and inexpensive forms of methamphetamine, coupled with a lower risk of overdose than with opiate drugs, is making crystal meth a popular choice among drug users today (NIDA, 2019). Using crystal meth poses a number of serious long-term health issues, including dental problems (often called "meth mouth"), skin abrasions caused by excessive scratching, memory loss, sleep problems, violent behavior, paranoia, and hallucinations. Methamphetamine addiction produces an intense craving that is difficult to treat.</p>

While amphetamines are often abused, they are also commonly prescribed to people diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It may seem counterintuitive that stimulant medications are prescribed to treat a disorder that involves hyperactivity, but the therapeutic effect comes from increases in neurotransmitter activity within certain areas of the brain associated with impulse control. These brain areas include the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia.</p>

Despite recent changes in laws designed to make obtaining pseudoephedrine more difficult, methamphetamine continues to be an easily accessible and relatively inexpensive drug option (Shukla, Crump, &amp; Chrisco, 2012).</p>

MDMA (3.4-methelynedioxy-methamphetamine, commonly known as "ecstasy" or "Molly") is a mild stimulant with perception-altering effects. It is typically consumed in pill form. Users experience increased energy, feelings of pleasure, and emotional warmth. Repeated use of these stimulants can have significant adverse consequences. Users can experience physical symptoms that include nausea, elevated blood pressure, and increased heart rate. In addition, these drugs can cause feelings of anxiety, hallucinations, and paranoia (Fiorentini et al., 2011). Normal brain functioning is altered after repeated use of these drugs. For example, repeated use can lead to overall depletion among the monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin). Depletion of certain neurotransmitters can lead to mood dysphoria, cognitive problems, and other factors. This can lead to people compulsively using stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines, in part to try to reestablish the person's physical and psychological pre-use baseline. (Jayanthi &amp; Ramamoorthy, 2005; Rothman, Blough, &amp; Baumann, 2007).</p>
            <p id="auto_937511e1-4e12-4a50-82de-e55fdcc804bb_fs-idp191698528">Caffeine is another stimulant drug. While it is probably the most commonly used drug in the world, the potency of this particular drug pales in comparison to the other stimulant drugs described in this section. Generally, people use caffeine to maintain increased levels of alertness and arousal. Caffeine is found in many common medicines (such as weight loss drugs), beverages, foods, and even cosmetics (Herman &amp; Herman, 2013). While caffeine may have some indirect effects on dopamine neurotransmission, its primary mechanism of action involves antagonizing adenosine activity (Porkka-Heiskanen, 2011). Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep. Caffeine is an adenosine antagonist, so caffeine inhibits the adenosine receptors, thus decreasing sleepiness and promoting wakefulness.</p>

In 2012, Kromann and Nielson reported on a case study of a 40-year-old woman who suffered significant ill effects from her use of caffeine. The woman used caffeine in the past to boost her mood and to provide energy, but over the course of several years, she increased her caffeine consumption to the point that she was consuming three liters of soda each day. Although she had been taking a prescription antidepressant, her symptoms of depression continued to worsen and she began to suffer physically, displaying significant warning signs of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Upon admission to an outpatient clinic for treatment of mood disorders, she met all of the diagnostic criteria for substance dependence and was advised to dramatically limit her caffeine intake. Once she was able to limit her use to less than 12 ounces of soda a day, both her mental and physical health gradually improved. Despite the prevalence of caffeine use and the large number of people who confess to suffering from caffeine addiction, this was the first published description of soda dependence appearing in scientific literature.</p>
            <p id="auto_937511e1-4e12-4a50-82de-e55fdcc804bb_fs-idp60548512">Nicotine is highly addictive, and the use of tobacco products is associated with increased risks of heart disease, stroke, and a variety of cancers. Nicotine exerts its effects through its interaction with acetylcholine receptors. Acetylcholine functions as a neurotransmitter in motor neurons. In the central nervous system, it plays a role in arousal and reward mechanisms. Nicotine is most commonly used in the form of tobacco products like cigarettes or chewing tobacco; therefore, there is a tremendous interest in developing effective smoking cessation techniques. To date, people have used a variety of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_937511e1-4e12-4a50-82de-e55fdcc804bb_term280" group-by="n">nicotine</span> replacement therapies in addition to various psychotherapeutic options in an attempt to discontinue their use of tobacco products. In general, smoking cessation programs may be effective in the short term, but it is unclear whether these effects persist (Cropley, Theadom, Pravettoni, &amp; Webb, 2008; Levitt, Shaw, Wong, &amp; Kaczorowski, 2007; Smedslund, Fisher, Boles, &amp; Lichtenstein, 2004). Vaping as a means to deliver nicotine is becoming increasingly popular, especially among teens and young adults. Vaping uses battery-powered devices, sometimes called e-cigarettes, that deliver liquid nicotine and flavorings as a vapor. Originally reported as a safe alternative to the known cancer-causing agents found in cigarettes, vaping is now known to be very dangerous and has led to serious lung disease and death in users (Shmerling, 2019).</p>

Opioids have analgesic properties; that is, they decrease pain. Humans have an endogenous opioid neurotransmitter system&#x2014;the body makes small quantities of opioid compounds that bind to opioid receptors reducing pain and producing euphoria. Thus, opioid drugs, which mimic this endogenous painkilling mechanism, have an extremely high potential for abuse. Natural opioids, called <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_937511e1-4e12-4a50-82de-e55fdcc804bb_term282" group-by="o">opiates</span>, are derivatives of opium, which is a naturally occurring compound found in the poppy plant. There are now several synthetic versions of opiate drugs (correctly called opioids) that have very potent painkilling effects, and they are often abused. For example, the National Institutes of Drug Abuse has sponsored research that suggests the misuse and abuse of the prescription pain killers hydrocodone and oxycodone are significant public health concerns (Maxwell, 2006). In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended tighter controls on their medical use.</p>

Heroin can be snorted, smoked, or injected intravenously. Heroin produces intense feelings of euphoria and pleasure, which are amplified when the heroin is injected intravenously. Following the initial "rush," users experience 4&#x2013;6 hours of "going on the nod," alternating between conscious and semiconscious states. Heroin users often shoot the drug directly into their veins. Some people who have injected many times into their arms will show "track marks,"  while other users will inject into areas between their fingers or between their toes, so as not to show obvious track marks and, like all abusers of intravenous drugs, have an increased risk for contraction of both tuberculosis and HIV.</p>

Given that withdrawal from a drug often involves an experience opposite to the effect of the drug, it should be no surprise that opioid withdrawal resembles a severe case of the flu. While opioid withdrawal can be extremely unpleasant, it is not life-threatening (Julien, 2005). Still, people experiencing opioid withdrawal may be given methadone to make withdrawal from the drug less difficult. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_937511e1-4e12-4a50-82de-e55fdcc804bb_term283" group-by="M">Methadone</span> is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_937511e1-4e12-4a50-82de-e55fdcc804bb_term284" group-by="M">Methadone clinics</span> help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone. Other drugs, including the opioid buprenorphine, have also been used to alleviate symptoms of opiate withdrawal.</p>

It is often prescribed for minor pain, and it is available over-the-counter in some other countries. Like all opioids, codeine does have abuse potential. In fact, abuse of prescription opioid medications is becoming a major concern worldwide (Aquina, Marques-Baptista, Bridgeman, &amp; Merlin, 2009; Casati, Sedefov, &amp; Pfeiffer-Gerschel, 2012).</p>

It seems like everyone knows a friend, family member, or neighbor who has died of an overdose. Opioid addiction reached crisis levels in the United States such that by 2019, an average of 130 people died <em data-effect="italics">each day</em> of an opioid overdose (NIDA, 2019). </p>
                <p id="auto_937511e1-4e12-4a50-82de-e55fdcc804bb_zip-idm238803024">The crisis actually began in the 1990s, when pharmaceutical companies began mass-marketing pain-relieving opioid drugs like OxyContin with the promise (now known to be false) that they were non-addictive. Increased prescriptions led to greater rates of misuse, along with greater incidence of addiction, even among patients who used these drugs as prescribed. Physiologically, the body can become addicted to opiate drugs in less than a week, including when taken as prescribed. Withdrawal from opioids includes pain, which patients often misinterpret as pain caused by the problem that led to the original prescription, and which motivates patients to continue using the drugs. </p>
                <p id="auto_937511e1-4e12-4a50-82de-e55fdcc804bb_zip-idm229196784">The FDA's 2013 recommendation for tighter controls on opiate prescriptions left many patients addicted to prescription drugs like OxyContin unable to obtain legitimate prescriptions. This created a black market for the drug, where prices soared to $80 or more for a single pill. To prevent withdrawal, many people turned to cheaper heroin, which could be bought for $5 a dose or less. To keep heroin affordable, many dealers began adding more potent synthetic opioids including fentanyl and carfentanyl to increase the effects of heroin. These synthetic drugs are so potent that even small doses can cause overdose and death. </p>
                <p id="auto_937511e1-4e12-4a50-82de-e55fdcc804bb_zip-idm232219024">Large-scale public health campaigns by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Drug Abuse have led to recent declines in the opioid crisis. These initiatives include increasing access to treatment and recovery services, increasing access to overdose-reversal drugs like Naloxone, and implementing better public health monitoring systems (NIDA, 2019).</p>

While the possession and use of marijuana remains illegal in many states, it is now legal to possess limited quantities of marijuana for recreational use in eleven states: Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Medical marijuana is legal in over half of the United States and in the District of Columbia (<a href="#auto_937511e1-4e12-4a50-82de-e55fdcc804bb_Figure_04_05_Marijuana" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 4.19</a>). Medical marijuana is marijuana that is prescribed by a doctor for the treatment of a health condition. For example, people who undergo chemotherapy will often be prescribed marijuana to stimulate their appetites and prevent excessive weight loss resulting from the side effects of chemotherapy treatment. Marijuana may also have some promise in the treatment of a variety of medical conditions (Mather, Rauwendaal, Moxham-Hall, &amp; Wodak, 2013; Robson, 2014; Schicho &amp; Storr, 2014).</p>

There is quite a bit of controversy within the scientific community as to the extent to which marijuana might have medicinal benefits due to a lack of large-scale, controlled research (Bostwick, 2012). As a result, many scientists have urged the federal government to allow for relaxation of current marijuana laws and classifications in order to facilitate a more widespread study of the drug&#x2019;s effects (Aggarwal et al., 2009; Bostwick, 2012; Kogan &amp; Mechoulam, 2007).</p>
                <p id="auto_937511e1-4e12-4a50-82de-e55fdcc804bb_fs-idp59146400">Until recently, the United States Department of Justice routinely arrested people involved and seized marijuana used in medicinal settings. In the latter part of 2013, however, the United States Department of Justice issued statements indicating that they would not continue to challenge state medical marijuana laws. This shift in policy may be in response to the scientific community&#x2019;s recommendations and/or reflect changing public opinion regarding marijuana.</p>

In the therapeutic setting, a clinician may use relaxation and suggestion in an attempt to alter the thoughts and perceptions of a patient. Hypnosis has also been used to draw out information believed to be buried deeply in someone&#x2019;s memory. For individuals who are especially open to the power of suggestion, hypnosis can prove to be a very effective technique, and brain imaging studies have demonstrated that hypnotic states are associated with global changes in brain functioning (Del Casale et al., 2012; Guldenmund, Vanhaudenhuyse, Boly, Laureys, &amp; Soddu, 2012).</p>

Therefore, it is important to make a distinction between hypnosis as an empirically based therapeutic approach versus as a form of entertainment. Contrary to popular belief, individuals undergoing hypnosis usually have clear memories of the hypnotic experience and are in control of their own behaviors. While hypnosis may be useful in enhancing memory or a skill, such enhancements are very modest in nature (Raz, 2011).</p>

          <p id="auto_43d144b8-e8c9-46b7-9283-63c840cf4e42_fs-idp645296">How exactly does a hypnotist bring a participant to a state of hypnosis? While there are variations, there are four parts that appear consistent in bringing people into the state of suggestibility associated with hypnosis (National Research Council, 1994). These components include:
    </p>
          <ul id="auto_43d144b8-e8c9-46b7-9283-63c840cf4e42_fs-idp131279680">
            <li>The participant is guided to focus on one thing, such as the hypnotist&#x2019;s words or a ticking watch.</li>
            <li>The participant is made comfortable and is directed to be relaxed and sleepy.</li>
            <li>The participant is told to be open to the process of hypnosis, trust the hypnotist and let go.</li>
            <li>The participant is encouraged to use his or her imagination.</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_43d144b8-e8c9-46b7-9283-63c840cf4e42_fs-idp155487664">These steps are conducive to being open to the heightened suggestibility of hypnosis.</p>
          <p id="auto_43d144b8-e8c9-46b7-9283-63c840cf4e42_fs-idm30058128">People vary in terms of their ability to be hypnotized, but a review of available research suggests that most people are at least moderately hypnotizable (Kihlstrom, 2013). Hypnosis in conjunction with other techniques is used for a variety of therapeutic purposes and has shown to be at least somewhat effective for pain management, treatment of depression and anxiety, smoking cessation, and weight loss (Alladin, 2012; Elkins, Johnson, &amp; Fisher, 2012; Golden, 2012; Montgomery, Schnur, &amp; Kravits, 2012).</p>
          <p id="auto_43d144b8-e8c9-46b7-9283-63c840cf4e42_fs-idm4849856">How does hypnosis work? Two theories attempt to answer this question: One theory views hypnosis as dissociation and the other theory views it as the performance of a social role. According to the dissociation view, hypnosis is effectively a dissociated state of consciousness, much like our earlier example where you may drive to work, but you are only minimally aware of the process of driving because your attention is focused elsewhere. This theory is supported by Ernest Hilgard&#x2019;s research into hypnosis and pain. In Hilgard&#x2019;s experiments, he induced participants into a state of hypnosis, and placed their arms into ice water. Participants were told they would not feel pain, but they could press a button if they did; while they reported not feeling pain, they did, in fact, press the button, suggesting a dissociation of consciousness while in the hypnotic state (Hilgard &amp; Hilgard, 1994).</p>
          <p id="auto_43d144b8-e8c9-46b7-9283-63c840cf4e42_fs-idp105019072">Taking a different approach to explain hypnosis, the social-cognitive theory of hypnosis sees people in hypnotic states as performing the social role of a hypnotized person. As you will learn when you study social roles, people&#x2019;s behavior can be shaped by their expectations of how they should act in a given situation. Some view a hypnotized person&#x2019;s behavior not as an altered or dissociated state of consciousness, but as their fulfillment of the social expectations for that role (Coe, 2009; Coe &amp; Sarbin, 1966).</p>

While hypnosis is generally achieved through the interaction of a therapist and the person being treated, an individual can perform meditation alone. Often, however, people wishing to learn to meditate receive some training in techniques to achieve a meditative state.</p>
          <p id="auto_43d144b8-e8c9-46b7-9283-63c840cf4e42_fs-idp98707536">Although there are a number of different techniques in use, the central feature of all meditation is clearing the mind in order to achieve a state of relaxed awareness and focus (Chen et al., 2013; Lang et al., 2012). Mindfulness meditation has recently become popular. In the variation of mindful meditation, the meditator&#x2019;s attention is focused on some internal process or an external object (Zeidan, Grant, Brown, McHaffie, &amp; Coghill, 2012).</p>
          <p id="auto_43d144b8-e8c9-46b7-9283-63c840cf4e42_fs-idp104536992">Meditative techniques have their roots in religious practices (<a href="#auto_43d144b8-e8c9-46b7-9283-63c840cf4e42_Figure_04_06_Buddha" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 4.21</a>), but their use has grown in popularity among practitioners of alternative medicine. Research indicates that meditation may help reduce blood pressure, and the American Heart Association suggests that meditation might be used in conjunction with more traditional treatments as a way to manage hypertension, although there is not sufficient data for a recommendation to be made (Brook et al., 2013). Like hypnosis, meditation also shows promise in stress management, sleep quality (Caldwell, Harrison, Adams, Quin, &amp; Greeson, 2010), treatment of mood and anxiety disorders (Chen et al., 2013; Freeman et al., 2010; V&#xF8;llestad, Nielsen, &amp; Nielsen, 2012), and pain management (Reiner, Tibi, &amp; Lipsitz, 2013).</p>

Important factors in these changes are the biological rhythms, and, more specifically, the circadian rhythms generated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Typically, our biological clocks are aligned with our external environment, and light tends to be an important cue in setting this clock. When people travel across multiple time zones or work rotating shifts, they can experience disruptions of their circadian cycles that can lead to insomnia, sleepiness, and decreased alertness. Bright light therapy has shown to be promising in dealing with circadian disruptions. If people go extended periods of time without sleep, they will accrue a sleep debt and potentially experience a number of adverse psychological and physiological consequences.</p>

          <p id="auto_3b74edc2-ba75-4070-bd97-f344d29dd8a2_fs-idm7160432">We devote a very large portion of time to sleep, and our brains have complex systems that control various aspects of sleep. Several hormones important for physical growth and maturation are secreted during sleep. While the reason we sleep remains something of a mystery, there is some evidence to suggest that sleep is very important to learning and memory.</p>

As a person transitions from being awake to falling asleep, alpha waves are replaced by theta waves. Sleep spindles and K-complexes emerge in stage 2 sleep. Stage 3 and stage 4 are described as slow-wave sleep that is marked by a predominance of delta waves. REM sleep involves rapid movements of the eyes, paralysis of voluntary muscles, and dreaming. Both NREM and REM sleep appear to play important roles in learning and memory. Dreams may represent life events that are important to the dreamer. Alternatively, dreaming may represent a state of protoconsciousness, or a virtual reality, in the mind that helps a person during consciousness.</p>

Insomnia is a common experience in which people have difficulty falling or staying asleep. Parasomnias involve unwanted motor behavior or experiences throughout the sleep cycle and include RBD, sleepwalking, restless leg syndrome, and night terrors. Sleep apnea occurs when individuals stop breathing during their sleep, and in the case of sudden infant death syndrome, infants will stop breathing during sleep and die. Narcolepsy involves an irresistible urge to fall asleep during waking hours and is often associated with cataplexy and hallucination.</p>

Both physical and psychological dependence are important parts of this disorder. Alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are central nervous system depressants that affect GABA neurotransmission. Cocaine, amphetamine, cathinones, and MDMA are all central nervous stimulants that agonize dopamine neurotransmission, while nicotine and caffeine affect acetylcholine and adenosine, respectively. Opiate drugs serve as powerful analgesics through their effects on the endogenous opioid neurotransmitter system, and hallucinogenic drugs cause pronounced changes in sensory and perceptual experiences. The hallucinogens are variable with regards to the specific neurotransmitter systems they affect.</p>

            <p id="auto_dd4bd0e8-0fd3-48b5-8ecd-a0345543e585_fs-idm153748160">Imagine standing on a city street corner. You might be struck by movement everywhere as cars and people go about their business, by the sound of a street musician&#x2019;s melody or a horn honking in the distance, by the smell of exhaust fumes or of food being sold by a nearby vendor, and by the sensation of hard pavement under your feet.</p>
            <p id="auto_dd4bd0e8-0fd3-48b5-8ecd-a0345543e585_fs-idm196114144">We rely on our sensory systems to provide important information about our surroundings. We use this information to successfully navigate and interact with our environment so that we can find nourishment, seek shelter, maintain social relationships, and avoid potentially dangerous situations.</p>
            <p id="auto_dd4bd0e8-0fd3-48b5-8ecd-a0345543e585_fs-idm201335200">This chapter will provide an overview of how sensory information is received and processed by the nervous system and how that affects our conscious experience of the world. We begin by learning the distinction between sensation and perception. Then we consider the physical properties of light and sound stimuli, along with an overview of the basic structure and function of the major sensory systems. The chapter will close with a discussion of a historically important theory of perception called Gestalt.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Sensation</h3>
          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp76436688">What does it mean to sense something? Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific types of stimuli. When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor, <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_term289" group-by="s">sensation</span> has occurred. For example, light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye. These cells relay messages, in the form of action potentials (as you learned when studying biopsychology), to the central nervous system. The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_term290" group-by="t">transduction</span>.</p>
          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp141991584">You have probably known since elementary school that we have five senses: vision, hearing (audition), smell (olfaction), taste (gustation), and touch (somatosensation). It turns out that this notion of five senses is oversimplified. We also have sensory systems that provide information about balance (the vestibular sense), body position and movement (proprioception and kinesthesia), pain (nociception), and temperature (thermoception).</p>
          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp153394112">The sensitivity of a given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_term291" group-by="A">Absolute threshold</span> refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to be detected 50% of the time. Another way to think about this is by asking how dim can a light be or how soft can a sound be and still be detected half of the time. The sensitivity of our sensory receptors can be quite amazing. It has been estimated that on a clear night, the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye can detect a candle flame 30 miles away (Okawa &amp; Sampath, 2007). Under quiet conditions, the hair cells (the receptor cells of the inner ear) can detect the tick of a clock 20 feet away (Galanter, 1962).</p>
          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp78339328">It is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness&#x2014;these are called <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_term292" group-by="s">subliminal messages</span>. A stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it is strong enough to excite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain: This is an absolute threshold. A message below that threshold is said to be subliminal: We receive it, but we are not consciously aware of it. Over the years there has been a great deal of speculation about the use of subliminal messages in advertising, rock music, and self-help audio programs. Research evidence shows that in laboratory settings, people can process and respond to information outside of awareness. But this does not mean that we obey these messages like zombies; in fact, hidden messages have little effect on behavior outside the laboratory (Kunst-Wilson &amp; Zajonc, 1980; Rensink, 2004; Nelson, 2008; Radel, Sarrazin, Legrain, &amp; Gobanc&#xE9;, 2009; Loersch, Durso, &amp; Petty, 2013).</p>
          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp230235264">Absolute thresholds are generally measured under incredibly controlled conditions in situations that are optimal for sensitivity. Sometimes, we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to detect a difference between them. This is known as the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_term293" group-by="j">just noticeable difference (jnd)</span> or <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_term294" group-by="d">difference threshold</span>. Unlike the absolute threshold, the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus intensity. As an example, imagine yourself in a very dark movie theater. If an audience member were to receive a text message that caused the cell phone screen to light up, chances are that many people would notice the change in illumination in the theater. However, if the same thing happened in a brightly lit arena during a basketball game, very few people would notice. The cell phone brightness does not change, but its ability to be detected as a change in illumination varies dramatically between the two contexts. Ernst Weber proposed this theory of change in difference threshold in the 1830s, and it has become known as Weber&#x2019;s law: The difference threshold is a constant fraction of the original stimulus, as the example illustrates.</p>

It is very noisy, and you are concentrating on your friend&#x2019;s face to hear what she is saying, then the sound of breaking glass and clang of metal pans hitting the floor rings out. The server dropped a large tray of food. Although you were attending to your meal and conversation, that crashing sound would likely get through your attentional filters and capture your attention. You would have no choice but to notice it. That attentional capture would be caused by the sound from the environment: it would be bottom-up.</p>
          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_zip-idm188791536">Alternatively, top-down processes are generally goal directed, slow, deliberate, effortful, and under your control (Fine &amp; Minnery, 2009; Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001; Miller &amp; D'Esposito, 2005). For instance, if you misplaced your keys, how would you look for them? If you had a yellow key fob, you would probably look for yellowness of a certain size in specific locations, such as on the counter, coffee table, and other similar places. You would not look for yellowness on your ceiling fan, because you know keys are not normally lying on top of a ceiling fan. That act of searching for a certain size of yellowness in some locations and not others would be top-down&#x2014;under your control and based on your experience.</p>
          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp199393776">One way to think of this concept is that sensation is a physical process, whereas perception is psychological. For example, upon walking into a kitchen and smelling the scent of baking cinnamon rolls, the <em data-effect="italics">sensation</em> is the scent receptors detecting the odor of cinnamon, but the <em data-effect="italics">perception</em> may be &#x201C;Mmm, this smells like the bread Grandma used to bake when the family gathered for holidays.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp91534272">Although our perceptions are built from sensations, not all sensations result in perception. In fact, we often don&#x2019;t perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time. This is known as <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_term298" group-by="s">sensory adaptation</span>. Imagine going to a city that you have never visited. You check in to the hotel, but when you get to your room, there is a road construction sign with a bright flashing light outside your window. Unfortunately, there are no other rooms available, so you are stuck with a flashing light. You decide to watch television to unwind. The flashing light was extremely annoying when you first entered your room. It was as if someone was continually turning a bright yellow spotlight on and off in your room, but after watching television for a short while, you no longer notice the light flashing. The light is still flashing and filling your room with yellow light every few seconds, and the photoreceptors in your eyes still sense the light, but you no longer perceive the rapid changes in lighting conditions. That you no longer perceive the flashing light demonstrates sensory adaptation and shows that while closely associated, sensation and perception are different.</p>
          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp55242896">There is another factor that affects sensation and perception: attention. Attention plays a significant role in determining what is sensed versus what is perceived. Imagine you are at a party full of music, chatter, and laughter. You get involved in an interesting conversation with a friend, and you tune out all the background noise. If someone interrupted you to ask what song had just finished playing, you would probably be unable to answer that question.</p>

In this study, participants watched a video of people dressed in black and white passing basketballs. Participants were asked to count the number of times the team dressed in white passed the ball. During the video, a person dressed in a black gorilla costume walks among the two teams. You would think that someone would notice the gorilla, right? Nearly half of the people who watched the video didn&#x2019;t notice the gorilla at all, despite the fact that he was clearly visible for nine seconds. Because participants were so focused on the number of times the team dressed in white was passing the ball, they completely tuned out other visual information. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_term299" group-by="I">Inattentional blindness</span> is the failure to notice something that is completely visible because the person was actively attending to something else and did not pay attention to other things (Mack &amp; Rock, 1998; Simons &amp; Chabris, 1999).</p>
          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp30562224">In a similar experiment, researchers tested inattentional blindness by asking participants to observe images moving across a computer screen. They were instructed to focus on either white or black objects, disregarding the other color. When a red cross passed across the screen, about one third of subjects did not notice it (<a href="#auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_Figure_05_01_Cross" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 5.3</a>) (Most, Simons, Scholl, &amp; Chabris, 2000).</p>

          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp20923600">Motivation can also affect perception. Have you ever been expecting a really important phone call and, while taking a shower, you think you hear the phone ringing, only to discover that it is not? If so, then you have experienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a true sensory stimulus and background noise. The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a distracting background is called <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_term300" group-by="s">signal detection theory</span>. This might also explain why a mother is awakened by a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep. Signal detection theory has practical applications, such as increasing air traffic controller accuracy. Controllers need to be able to detect planes among many signals (blips) that appear on the radar screen and follow those planes as they move through the sky. In fact, the original work of the researcher who developed signal detection theory was focused on improving the sensitivity of air traffic controllers to plane blips (Swets, 1964).</p>
          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp235780256">Our perceptions can also be affected by our beliefs, values, prejudices, expectations, and life experiences. As you will see later in this chapter, individuals who are deprived of the experience of binocular vision during critical periods of development have trouble perceiving depth (Fawcett, Wang, &amp; Birch, 2005). The shared experiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception. For example, Marshall Segall, Donald Campbell, and Melville Herskovits (1963) published the results of a multinational study in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_term301" group-by="c">cultures</span> were more prone to experience certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non-Western cultures, and vice versa. One such illusion that Westerners were more likely to experience was the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_term302" group-by="M">M&#xFC;ller-Lyer</span> illusion (<a href="#auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_Figure_05_01_MullerLyer" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 5.4</a>): The lines appear to be different lengths, but they are actually the same length.</p>

          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp62443008">These perceptual differences were consistent with differences in the types of environmental features experienced on a regular basis by people in a given cultural context. People in Western cultures, for example, have a perceptual context of buildings with straight lines, what Segall&#x2019;s study called a carpentered world (Segall et al., 1966). In contrast, people from certain non-Western cultures with an uncarpentered view, such as the Zulu of South Africa, whose villages are made up of round huts arranged in circles, are less susceptible to this illusion (Segall et al., 1999). It is not just vision that is affected by cultural factors. Indeed, research has demonstrated that the ability to identify an odor, and rate its pleasantness and its intensity, varies cross-culturally (Ayabe-Kanamura, Saito, Distel, Mart&#xED;nez-G&#xF3;mez, &amp; Hudson, 1998).</p>
          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp188022720">Children described as thrill seekers are more likely to show taste preferences for intense sour flavors (Liem, Westerbeek, Wolterink, Kok, &amp; de Graaf, 2004), which suggests that basic aspects of personality might affect perception. Furthermore, individuals who hold positive attitudes toward reduced-fat foods are more likely to rate foods labeled as reduced fat as tasting better than people who have less positive attitudes about these products (Aaron, Mela, &amp; Evans, 1994).</p>

The visible spectrum in humans is associated with wavelengths that range from 380 to 740 nm&#x2014;a very small distance, since a nanometer (nm) is one billionth of a meter. Other species can detect other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. For instance, honeybees can see light in the ultraviolet range (Wakakuwa, Stavenga, &amp; Arikawa, 2007), and some snakes can detect infrared radiation in addition to more traditional visual light cues (Chen, Deng, Brauth, Ding, &amp; Tang, 2012; Hartline, Kass, &amp; Loop, 1978).</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Sound Waves</h3>
          <p id="auto_d7568e9f-481b-4a1b-a70f-598fa16ca29a_fs-idm2640704">Like light waves, the physical properties of sound waves are associated with various aspects of our perception of sound. The frequency of a sound wave is associated with our perception of that sound&#x2019;s <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_d7568e9f-481b-4a1b-a70f-598fa16ca29a_term309" group-by="p">pitch</span>. High-frequency sound waves are perceived as high-pitched sounds, while low-frequency sound waves are perceived as low-pitched sounds. The audible range of sound frequencies is between 20 and 20000 Hz, with greatest sensitivity to those frequencies that fall in the middle of this range.</p>
          <p id="auto_d7568e9f-481b-4a1b-a70f-598fa16ca29a_fs-idp89513280">As was the case with the visible spectrum, other species show differences in their audible ranges. For instance, chickens have a very limited audible range, from 125 to 2000 Hz. Mice have an audible range from 1000 to 91000 Hz, and the beluga whale&#x2019;s audible range is from 1000 to 123000 Hz. Our pet dogs and cats have audible ranges of about 70&#x2013;45000 Hz and 45&#x2013;64000 Hz, respectively (Strain, 2003).</p>
          <p id="auto_d7568e9f-481b-4a1b-a70f-598fa16ca29a_fs-idp9306416">The loudness of a given sound is closely associated with the amplitude of the sound wave. Higher amplitudes are associated with louder sounds. Loudness is measured in terms of <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_d7568e9f-481b-4a1b-a70f-598fa16ca29a_term310" group-by="d">decibels (dB)</span>, a logarithmic unit of sound intensity. A typical conversation would correlate with 60 dB; a rock concert might check in at 120 dB (<a href="#auto_d7568e9f-481b-4a1b-a70f-598fa16ca29a_Figure_05_02_AudRange" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 5.9</a>). A whisper 5 feet away or rustling leaves are at the low end of our hearing range; sounds like a window air conditioner, a normal conversation, and even heavy traffic or a vacuum cleaner are within a tolerable range. However, there is the potential for hearing damage from about 80 dB to 130 dB: These are sounds of a food processor, power lawnmower, heavy truck (25 feet away), subway train (20 feet away), live rock music, and a jackhammer. About one-third of all hearing loss is due to noise exposure, and the louder the sound, the shorter the exposure needed to cause hearing damage (Le, Straatman, Lea, &amp; Westerberg, 2017). Listening to music through earbuds at maximum volume (around 100&#x2013;105 decibels) can cause noise-induced hearing loss after 15 minutes of exposure. Although listening to music at maximum volume may not seem to cause damage, it increases the risk of age-related hearing loss (Kujawa &amp; Liberman, 2006). The threshold for pain is about 130 dB, a jet plane taking off or a revolver firing at close range (Dunkle, 1982).</p>

For example, a 10 Hz sound wave is inaudible no matter the amplitude of the wave. A 1000 Hz sound wave, on the other hand, would vary dramatically in terms of perceived loudness as the amplitude of the wave increased.</p>

Light waves are transmitted across the cornea and enter the eye through the pupil.

It serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world, and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye. The <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_term314" group-by="p">pupil</span> is the small opening in the eye through which light passes, and the size of the pupil can change as a function of light levels as well as emotional arousal. When light levels are low, the pupil will become dilated, or expanded, to allow more light to enter the eye. When light levels are high, the pupil will constrict, or become smaller, to reduce the amount of light that enters the eye. The pupil&#x2019;s size is controlled by muscles that are connected to the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_term315" group-by="i">iris</span>, which is the colored portion of the eye.</p>

Imagine going to see a blockbuster movie on a clear summer day. As you walk from the brightly lit lobby into the dark theater, you notice that you immediately have difficulty seeing much of anything. After a few minutes, you begin to adjust to the darkness and can see the interior of the theater. In the bright environment, your vision was dominated primarily by cone activity. As you move to the dark environment, rod activity dominates, but there is a delay in transitioning between the phases. If your rods do not transform light into nerve impulses as easily and efficiently as they should, you will have difficulty seeing in dim light, a condition known as night blindness.</p>
          <p id="auto_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_fs-idm76128816">Rods and cones are connected (via several interneurons) to retinal ganglion cells. Axons from the retinal ganglion cells converge and exit through the back of the eye to form the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_term322" group-by="o">optic nerve</span>. The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain. There is a point in the visual field called the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_term323" group-by="b">blind spot</span>: Even when light from a small object is focused on the blind spot, we do not see it. We are not consciously aware of our blind spots for two reasons: First, each eye gets a slightly different view of the visual field; therefore, the blind spots do not overlap. Second, our visual system fills in the blind spot so that although we cannot respond to visual information that occurs in that portion of the visual field, we are also not aware that information is missing.</p>
          <p id="auto_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_fs-idp89685600">The optic nerve from each eye merges just below the brain at a point called the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_term324" group-by="o">optic chiasm</span>.

At the point of the optic chiasm, information from the right visual field (which comes from both eyes) is sent to the left side of the brain, and information from the left visual field is sent to the right side of the brain.</p>

          <p id="auto_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_fs-idm48126160">Once inside the brain, visual information is sent via a number of structures to the occipital lobe at the back of the brain for processing. Visual information might be processed in parallel pathways which can generally be described as the &#x201C;what pathway&#x201D; and the &#x201C;where/how&#x201D; pathway. The &#x201C;what pathway&#x201D; is involved in object recognition and identification, while the &#x201C;where/how pathway&#x201D; is involved with location in space and how one might interact with a particular visual stimulus (Milner &amp; Goodale, 2008; Ungerleider &amp; Haxby, 1994). For example, when you see a ball rolling down the street, the &#x201C;what pathway&#x201D; identifies what the object is, and the &#x201C;where/how pathway&#x201D; identifies its location or movement in space.</p>

They collaborated for more than twenty years and made significant discoveries about the neurology of visual perception (Hubel &amp; Wiesel, 1959, 1962, 1963, 1970; Wiesel &amp; Hubel, 1963). They studied animals, mostly cats and monkeys. Although they used several techniques, they did considerable single unit recordings, during which tiny electrodes were inserted in the animal&#x2019;s brain to determine when a single cell was activated. Among their many discoveries, they found that specific brain cells respond to lines with specific orientations (called ocular dominance), and they mapped the way those cells are arranged in areas of the visual cortex known as columns and hypercolumns.</p>
              <p id="auto_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_zip-idm174533248">In some of their research, they sutured one eye of newborn kittens closed and followed the development of the kittens' vision. They discovered there was a critical period of development for vision. If kittens were deprived of input from one eye, other areas of their visual cortex filled in the area that was normally used by the eye that was sewn closed. In other words, neural connections that exist at birth can be lost if they are deprived of sensory input.</p>

To many animal advocates, this would seem brutal, abusive, and unethical. What if you could do research that would help ensure babies and children born with certain conditions could develop normal vision instead of becoming blind? Would you want that research done? Would you conduct that research, even if it meant causing some harm to cats? Would you think the same way if you were the parent of such a child? What if you worked at the animal shelter?</p>

The goal of any laws that exist is not to ban such tests but rather to limit unnecessary animal suffering by establishing standards for the humane treatment and housing of animals in laboratories.</p>
              <p id="auto_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_zip-idm483508176">As explained by Stephen Latham, the director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics at Yale (2012), possible legal and regulatory approaches to animal testing vary on a continuum from strong government regulation and monitoring of all experimentation at one end, to a self-regulated approach that depends on the ethics of the researchers at the other end. The United Kingdom has the most significant regulatory scheme, whereas Japan uses the self-regulation approach. The U.S. approach is somewhere in the middle, the result of a gradual blending of the two approaches.</p>
              <p id="auto_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_zip-idm204763216">There is no question that medical research is a valuable and important practice. The question is whether the use of animals is a necessary or even best practice for producing the most reliable results. Alternatives include the use of patient-drug databases, virtual drug trials, computer models and simulations, and noninvasive imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans (&#x201C;Animals in Science/Alternatives,&#x201D; n.d.). Other techniques, such as microdosing, use humans not as test animals but as a means to improve the accuracy and reliability of test results. In vitro methods based on human cell and tissue cultures, stem cells, and genetic testing methods are also increasingly available.</p>

The IACUC must include researchers, administrators, a veterinarian, and at least one person with no ties to the institution: that is, a concerned citizen. This committee also performs inspections of laboratories and protocols.</p>

She looked up at me, and in her most stern voice, said, &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t wear that.&#x201D; I asked, "Why not?" and she informed me the colors of my clothes did not match. She had complained frequently that I was bad at matching my shirts, pants, and ties, but this time, she sounded especially alarmed. As a single father with no one else to ask at home, I drove us to the nearest convenience store and asked the store clerk if my clothes matched. She said my pants were a bright green color, my shirt was a reddish orange, and my tie was brown. She looked at my quizzically and said, "No way do your clothes match." Over the next few days, I started asking my coworkers and friends if my clothes matched. After several days of being told that my coworkers just thought I had "a really unique style," I made an appointment with an eye doctor and was tested (<a href="#auto_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_Figure_05_03_Ishihara" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 5.15</a>). It was then that I found out that I was colorblind. I cannot differentiate between most greens, browns, and reds. Fortunately, other than unknowingly being badly dressed, my colorblindness rarely harms my day-to-day life.</p>

Seeing in grayscale (only shades of black and white) is extremely rare, and people who do so only have rods, which means they have very low visual acuity and cannot see very well. The most common X-linked inherited abnormality is red-green color blindness (Birch, 2012). Approximately 8% of males with European Caucasian decent, 5% of Asian males, 4% of African males, and less than 2% of indigenous American males, Australian males, and Polynesian males have red-green color deficiency (Birch, 2012). Comparatively, only about 0.4% in females from European Caucasian descent have red-green color deficiency (Birch, 2012).</p>

According to this theory, color is coded in opponent pairs: black-white, yellow-blue, and green-red. The basic idea is that some cells of the visual system are excited by one of the opponent colors and inhibited by the other. So, a cell that was excited by wavelengths associated with green would be inhibited by wavelengths associated with red, and vice versa. One of the implications of opponent processing is that we do not experience greenish-reds or yellowish-blues as colors. Another implication is that this leads to the experience of negative afterimages.

For example, when you stare briefly at the sun and then look away from it, you may still perceive a spot of light although the stimulus (the sun) has been removed. When color is involved in the stimulus, the color pairings identified in the opponent-process theory lead to a negative afterimage.

Research has shown that they just apply to different levels of the nervous system. For visual processing on the retina, trichromatic theory applies: the cones are responsive to three different wavelengths that represent red, blue, and green. But once the signal moves past the retina on its way to the brain, the cells respond in a way consistent with opponent-process theory (Land, 1959; Kaiser, 1997).</p>

To experience this slightly different view, do this simple exercise: extend your arm fully and extend one of your fingers and focus on that finger.

Think about all the paintings and photographs you have seen. Generally, you pick up on depth in these images even though the visual stimulus is 2-D. When we do this, we are relying on a number of <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_term333" group-by="m">monocular cues</span>, or cues that require only one eye. If you think you can&#x2019;t see depth with one eye, note that you don&#x2019;t bump into things when using only one eye while walking&#x2014;and, in fact, we have more monocular cues than binocular cues.</p>

Some other monocular depth cues are interposition, the partial overlap of objects, and the relative size and closeness of images to the horizon.</p>

He relied heavily on monocular depth cues, but he never had a true appreciation of the 3-D nature of the world around him. This all changed one night in 2012 while Bruce was seeing a movie with his wife.</p>
                <p id="auto_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_fs-idm26379360">The movie the couple was going to see was shot in 3-D, and even though he thought it was a waste of money, Bruce paid for the 3-D glasses when he purchased his ticket. As soon as the film began, Bruce put on the glasses and experienced something completely new. For the first time in his life he appreciated the true depth of the world around him. Remarkably, his ability to perceive depth persisted outside of the movie theater.</p>
                <p id="auto_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_fs-idm130673792">There are cells in the nervous system that respond to binocular depth cues. Normally, these cells require activation during early development in order to persist, so experts familiar with Bruce&#x2019;s case (and others like his) assume that at some point in his development, Bruce must have experienced at least a fleeting moment of binocular vision. It was enough to ensure the survival of the cells in the visual system tuned to binocular cues. The mystery now is why it took Bruce nearly 70 years to have these cells activated (Peck, 2012).</p>

This vibration results in movement of the three ossicles. As the ossicles move, the stapes presses into a thin membrane of the cochlea known as the oval window. As the stapes presses into the oval window, the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move, which in turn stimulates <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_term342" group-by="h">hair cells</span>, which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane.

          <p id="auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_fs-idm109540512">The activation of hair cells is a mechanical process: the stimulation of the hair cell ultimately leads to activation of the cell. As hair cells become activated, they generate neural impulses that travel along the auditory nerve to the brain. Auditory information is shuttled to the inferior colliculus, the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, and finally to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain for processing. Like the visual system, there is also evidence suggesting that information about auditory recognition and localization is processed in parallel streams (Rauschecker &amp; Tian, 2000; Renier et al., 2009).</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Pitch Perception</h3>
          <p id="auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_fs-idm23913376">Different frequencies of sound waves are associated with differences in our perception of the pitch of those sounds. Low-frequency sounds are lower pitched, and high-frequency sounds are higher pitched. How does the auditory system differentiate among various pitches?</p>
          <p id="auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_fs-idm68272576">Several theories have been proposed to account for pitch perception. We&#x2019;ll discuss two of them here: temporal theory and place theory. The <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_term344" group-by="t">temporal theory</span> of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the activity level of a sensory neuron. This would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related to the frequency of the sound wave. While this is a very intuitive explanation, we detect such a broad range of frequencies (20&#x2013;20,000 Hz) that the frequency of action potentials fired by hair cells cannot account for the entire range. Because of properties related to sodium channels on the neuronal membrane that are involved in action potentials, there is a point at which a cell cannot fire any faster (Shamma, 2001).</p>
          <p id="auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_fs-idm114454112">The <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_term345" group-by="p">place theory</span> of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive to sounds of different frequencies. More specifically, the base of the basilar membrane responds best to high frequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies. Therefore, hair cells that are in the base portion would be labeled as high-pitch receptors, while those in the tip of basilar membrane would be labeled as low-pitch receptors (Shamma, 2001).</p>
          <p id="auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_fs-idm109521184">In reality, both theories explain different aspects of pitch perception. At frequencies up to about 4000 Hz, it is clear that both the rate of action potentials and place contribute to our perception of pitch. However, much higher frequency sounds can only be encoded using place cues (Shamma, 2001).</p>

          <p id="auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_fs-idm6350992">The ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_term346" group-by="h">hearing</span>. Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields. Like the monocular and binocular cues that provided information about depth, the auditory system uses both <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_term347" group-by="m">monaural</span> (one-eared) and <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_term348" group-by="b">binaural</span> (two-eared) cues to localize sound.</p>
          <p id="auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_fs-idm105205456">Each pinna interacts with incoming sound waves differently, depending on the sound&#x2019;s source relative to our bodies. This interaction provides a monaural cue that is helpful in locating sounds that occur above or below and in front or behind us. The sound waves received by your two ears from sounds that come from directly above, below, in front, or behind you would be identical; therefore, monaural cues are essential (Grothe, Pecka, &amp; McAlpine, 2010).</p>
          <p id="auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_fs-idm187429792">Binaural cues, on the other hand, provide information on the location of a sound along a horizontal axis by relying on differences in patterns of vibration of the eardrum between our two ears. If a sound comes from an off-center location, it creates two types of binaural cues: interaural level differences and interaural timing differences. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_term349" group-by="I">Interaural level difference</span> refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_term350" group-by="I">Interaural timing difference</span> refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear (<a href="#auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_Figure_05_04_MonInt" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 5.19</a>). Certain brain areas monitor these differences to construct where along a horizontal axis a sound originates (Grothe et al., 2010).</p>

          <p id="auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_fs-idm115274752">Given the mechanical nature by which the sound wave stimulus is transmitted from the eardrum through the ossicles to the oval window of the cochlea, some degree of hearing loss is inevitable. With conductive hearing loss, hearing problems are associated with a failure in the vibration of the eardrum and/or movement of the ossicles. These problems are often dealt with through devices like hearing aids that amplify incoming sound waves to make vibration of the eardrum and movement of the ossicles more likely to occur.</p>

In the United States, deaf individuals often communicate using American Sign Language (ASL); ASL has no verbal component and is based entirely on visual signs and gestures. The primary mode of communication is signing. One of the values of deaf culture is to continue traditions like using sign language rather than teaching deaf children to try to speak, read lips, or have cochlear implant surgery.</p>

Should the child be enrolled in mainstream schools and taught to verbalize and read lips? Or should the child be sent to a school for deaf children to learn ASL and have significant exposure to deaf culture? Do you think there might be differences in the way that parents approach these decisions depending on whether or not they are also deaf?</p>

There is also a growing body of experimental evidence suggesting that we possess a taste for the fatty content of a given food (Mizushige, Inoue, &amp; Fushiki, 2007).</p>

Taste buds have a life cycle of ten days to two weeks, so even destroying some by burning your tongue won&#x2019;t have any long-term effect; they just grow right back. Taste molecules bind to receptors on this extension and cause chemical changes within the sensory cell that result in neural impulses being transmitted to the brain via different nerves, depending on where the receptor is located. Taste information is transmitted to the medulla, thalamus, and limbic system, and to the gustatory cortex, which is tucked underneath the overlap between the frontal and temporal lobes (Maffei, Haley, &amp; Fontanini, 2012; Roper, 2013).</p>

We often think of dogs as having far superior olfactory systems than our own, and indeed, dogs can do some remarkable things with their noses. There is some evidence to suggest that dogs can &#x201C;smell&#x201D; dangerous drops in blood glucose levels as well as cancerous tumors (Wells, 2010). Dogs&#x2019; extraordinary olfactory abilities may be due to the increased number of functional genes for olfactory receptors (between 800 and 1200), compared to the fewer than 400 observed in humans and other primates (Niimura &amp; Nei, 2007).</p>

Pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status of a potential mate. So, for example, when a female rat is ready to mate, she secretes pheromonal signals that draw attention from nearby male rats. Pheromonal activation is actually an important component in eliciting sexual behavior in the male rat (Furlow, 1996, 2012; Purvis &amp; Haynes, 1972; Sachs, 1997). There has also been a good deal of research (and controversy) about pheromones in humans (Comfort, 1971; Russell, 1976; Wolfgang-Kimball, 1992; Weller, 1998).</p>

Feeling pain is quite adaptive because it makes us aware of an injury, and it motivates us to remove ourselves from the cause of that injury. In addition, pain also makes us less likely to suffer additional injury because we will be gentler with our injured body parts.</p>

The vestibular organs are fluid-filled and have hair cells, similar to the ones found in the auditory system, which respond to movement of the head and gravitational forces. When these hair cells are stimulated, they send signals to the brain via the vestibular nerve. Although we may not be consciously aware of our vestibular system&#x2019;s sensory information under normal circumstances, its importance is apparent when we experience motion sickness and/or dizziness related to infections of the inner ear (Khan &amp; Chang, 2013).</p>

        <p id="auto_2f2f5214-14eb-4eab-a406-9aa7047c9d90_fs-idm46397072">In the early part of the 20th century, Max Wertheimer published a paper demonstrating that individuals perceived motion in rapidly flickering static images&#x2014;an insight that came to him as he used a child&#x2019;s toy tachistoscope. Wertheimer, and his assistants Wolfgang K&#xF6;hler and Kurt Koffka, who later became his partners, believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli. This belief led to a new movement within the field of psychology known as <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_2f2f5214-14eb-4eab-a406-9aa7047c9d90_term379" group-by="G">Gestalt psychology</span>. The word <em data-effect="italics">gestalt </em>literally means form or pattern, but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts. In other words, the brain creates a perception that is more than simply the sum of available sensory inputs, and it does so in predictable ways. Gestalt psychologists translated these predictable ways into principles by which we organize sensory information. As a result, Gestalt psychology has been extremely influential in the area of sensation and perception (Rock &amp; Palmer, 1990).</p>
        <p id="auto_2f2f5214-14eb-4eab-a406-9aa7047c9d90_fs-idp71230224">One Gestalt principle is the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_2f2f5214-14eb-4eab-a406-9aa7047c9d90_term380" group-by="f">figure-ground relationship</span>. According to this principle, we tend to segment our visual world into figure and ground. Figure is the object or person that is the focus of the visual field, while the ground is the background. As <a href="#auto_2f2f5214-14eb-4eab-a406-9aa7047c9d90_Figure_05_06_FacesVase" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 5.25</a> shows, our perception can vary tremendously, depending on what is perceived as figure and what is perceived as ground. Presumably, our ability to interpret sensory information depends on what we label as figure and what we label as ground in any particular case, although this assumption has been called into question (Peterson &amp; Gibson, 1994; Vecera &amp; O&#x2019;Reilly, 1998).</p>

Research suggests that implicit racial <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_2f2f5214-14eb-4eab-a406-9aa7047c9d90_term390" group-by="p">prejudice</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_2f2f5214-14eb-4eab-a406-9aa7047c9d90_term391" group-by="s">stereotypes</span> affect perception. For instance, several studies have demonstrated that non-Black participants identify weapons faster and are more likely to identify non-weapons as weapons when the image of the weapon is paired with the image of a Black person (Payne, 2001; Payne, Shimizu, &amp; Jacoby, 2005). Furthermore, White individuals&#x2019; decisions to shoot an armed target in a video game is made more quickly when the target is Black (Correll, Park, Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2002; Correll, Urland, &amp; Ito, 2006). This research is important, considering the number of very high-profile cases in the last few decades in which young Black people were killed by people who claimed to believe that the unarmed individuals were armed and/or represented some threat to their personal safety.</p>

          <p id="auto_76abf095-1e5c-4f55-97ca-ba9b7f65bdf1_fs-idp73201920">Sensation occurs when sensory receptors detect sensory stimuli. Perception involves the organization, interpretation, and conscious experience of those sensations. All sensory systems have both absolute and difference thresholds, which refer to the minimum amount of stimulus energy or the minimum amount of difference in stimulus energy required to be detected about 50% of the time, respectively. Sensory adaptation, selective attention, and signal detection theory can help explain what is perceived and what is not. In addition, our perceptions are affected by a number of factors, including beliefs, values, prejudices, culture, and life experiences.</p>

Wavelength and frequency are inversely related so that longer waves have lower frequencies, and shorter waves have higher frequencies. In the visual system, a light wave&#x2019;s wavelength is generally associated with color, and its amplitude is associated with brightness. In the auditory system, a sound&#x2019;s frequency is associated with pitch, and its amplitude is associated with loudness.</p>

The eye&#x2019;s lens focuses this light so that the image is focused on a region of the retina known as the fovea. The fovea contains cones that possess high levels of visual acuity and operate best in bright light conditions. Rods are located throughout the retina and operate best under dim light conditions. Visual information leaves the eye via the optic nerve. Information from each visual field is sent to the opposite side of the brain at the optic chiasm. Visual information then moves through a number of brain sites before reaching the occipital lobe, where it is processed.</p>
          <p id="auto_6f989101-5c8a-4e10-8b2a-6958cccc83a8_fs-idm85260848">Two theories explain color perception. The trichromatic theory asserts that three distinct cone groups are tuned to slightly different wavelengths of light, and it is the combination of activity across these cone types that results in our perception of all the colors we see. The opponent-process theory of color vision asserts that color is processed in opponent pairs and accounts for the interesting phenomenon of a negative afterimage. We perceive depth through a combination of monocular and binocular depth cues.</p>

          <p id="auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_fs-idm10660208">Sound waves are funneled into the auditory canal and cause vibrations of the eardrum; these vibrations move the ossicles. As the ossicles move, the stapes presses against the oval window of the cochlea, which causes fluid inside the cochlea to move. As a result, hair cells embedded in the basilar membrane become enlarged, which sends neural impulses to the brain via the auditory nerve.</p>
          <p id="auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_fs-idm106071024">Pitch perception and sound localization are important aspects of hearing. Our ability to perceive pitch relies on both the firing rate of the hair cells in the basilar membrane as well as their location within the membrane. In terms of sound localization, both monaural and binaural cues are used to locate where sounds originate in our environment.</p>
          <p id="auto_988ad23a-408d-4f22-ba91-ea81e2d6c7eb_fs-idp53590976">Individuals can be born deaf, or they can develop deafness as a result of age, genetic predisposition, and/or environmental causes. Hearing loss that results from a failure of the vibration of the eardrum or the resultant movement of the ossicles is called conductive hearing loss. Hearing loss that involves a failure of the transmission of auditory nerve impulses to the brain is called sensorineural hearing loss.</p>

Our ability to perceive touch, temperature, and pain is mediated by a number of receptors and free nerve endings that are distributed throughout the skin and various tissues of the body. The vestibular sense helps us maintain a sense of balance through the response of hair cells in the utricle, saccule, and semi-circular canals that respond to changes in head position and gravity. Our proprioceptive and kinesthetic systems provide information about body position and body movement through receptors that detect stretch and tension in the muscles, joints, tendons, and skin of the body.</p>

Gestalt principles such as figure-ground relationship, grouping by proximity or similarity, the law of good continuation, and closure are all used to help explain how we organize sensory information. Our perceptions are not infallible, and they can be influenced by bias, prejudice, and other factors.</p>
