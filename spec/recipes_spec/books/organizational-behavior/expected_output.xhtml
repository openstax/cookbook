        <p id="auto_c7b1e273-27fd-4779-9f16-d0a6c95154ad_fs-idm357612080">The field of management and organizational behavior exists today in a constant state of evolution and change. Casual readers of publications like the New York Times, The Economist and the Wall Street Journal will learn about the dynamic nature of organizations in today&#x2019;s ever-changing business environment. <em data-effect="italics">Organizational Behavior</em> is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of the introductory course on Organizational Behavior. This is a traditional approach to organizational behavior. The table of contents of this book was designed to address two main themes. What are the variables that affect how, when, where, and why managers perform their jobs? What theories and techniques are used by successful managers at a variety of organizational levels to achieve and exceed objectives effectively and efficiently throughout their careers? Management is a broad business discipline, and the Organizational Behavior course covers many areas such as individual and group behavior at work, as well as organizational processes such as communication in the workplace and managing conflict and negotiation. No one individual can be an expert in all areas of management, so an additional benefit of this text is that specialists in a variety of areas have authored individual chapters. Finally, we all made an effort to present a balanced approach to gender and diversity throughout the text in the examples used, the photographs selected, and the use of both male and female in alternating chapters when referring to generic managers or employees.</p>

Contrarily, Microsoft engineers were able to develop and execute the programming on Vista, but it took considerably longer and was a bigger undertaking, with almost 6,000 engineers at hand. What was the difference?</p>
                <p id="auto_e4112b33-edb8-4e97-943a-859ec40197a7_fs-idm208018832">According to the study conducted by leadership consulting firm Bain &amp; Company, companies like Apple, Google, and Netflix are 40 percent more productive than the average company. Some may think that this is a product of the hiring pool; big companies generally attract a more talented group of recruits. With unique benefits and prowess in the industry, this must be the case. Wrong. Google and Apple have found a way to answer the most fundamental question in management: How do you balance productivity while maintaining employee satisfaction and commitment?</p>
                <p id="auto_e4112b33-edb8-4e97-943a-859ec40197a7_fs-idm211268512">Companies such as Google have approximately the same percentage of &#x201C;star players&#x201D; as other companies, but instead of spreading out the talent, they group them dynamically to achieve more throughout the day. This grouping focuses on grouping key players in the most business-critical roles, and is the key to success for the overall company. You&#x2019;ve heard the saying &#x201C;You&#x2019;re only as strong as your weakest link,&#x201D; and in the case of Apple, there were no weak links, making their productivity extremely high overall. To make matters more complicated, the fast-paced workplace and technology changes, including the diversity of employees and the global marketplace, takes a considerable toll on employee expectations, as do the overall stresses of the business performance. Apple is just one example of a company that figured out one of the pieces to this puzzle, but it is illustrative of what is happening in the workplace all around the globe.</p>
                <p id="auto_e4112b33-edb8-4e97-943a-859ec40197a7_fs-idm210047360">Contemporary managers are witnessing changes in technologies, markets, competition, workforce demographics, employee expectations, and ethical standards. At the heart of these changes is the issue of how to manage people effectively. To attain corporate objectives, each manager must discover how to develop and maintain a workforce that can meet today&#x2019;s needs while getting ready for tomorrow&#x2019;s challenges. As a result, managers are asking questions such as:</p>
                <ul id="auto_e4112b33-edb8-4e97-943a-859ec40197a7_fs-idm205440864" data-bullet-style="none" class="no-style">

                  <li>How can we improve communication and decision-making processes at work?</li>
                  <li>How should we evaluate and reward performance?</li>
                  <li>How can we develop the company leaders of tomorrow?</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="auto_e4112b33-edb8-4e97-943a-859ec40197a7_fs-idm204684880">Questions such as these point to the issue of effective management. That is, what can managers do to improve both organizational and employee performance? Effective management requires an in-depth knowledge of financial management, marketing research and consumer behavior, accounting and control practices, manufacturing and production techniques, and quantitative methods. In addition, however, effective management requires &#x201C;people skills.&#x201D; That is, a good manager must be able to motivate his employees, to lead skillfully, to make appropriate and timely decisions, to communicate effectively, to organize work, to deal with organizational politics, and to work to develop both employees and the organization as a whole. These issues constitute the subject of this course. We shall examine principles of the behavioral sciences that can help managers improve both their own skills and abilities and those of their subordinates in order to enhance organizational performance and effectiveness.</p>

Contemporary challenges are discussed. Next, we consider a model of organizational behavior that will serve as a guide throughout the study of management and organizational behavior. We begin with an examination of work.</p>

Obviously, some jobs are more meaningful than others, and some individuals are more easily satisfied than others. Some people live to work, while others simply work to live. In any case, people clearly have strong feelings about what they do on the job and about the people with whom they work. In our study of behavior in organizations, we shall examine what people do, what causes them to do it, and how they feel about what they do. As a prelude to this analysis, however, we should first consider the basic unit of analysis in this study: work itself. What is work, and what functions does it serve in today&#x2019;s society?</p>
          <p id="auto_839157c1-138c-462c-acb7-3c88f19cbd2f_fs-idm210691232">Work has a variety of meanings in contemporary society. Often we think of work as paid employment&#x2014;the exchange of services for money. Although this definition may suffice in a technical sense, it does not adequately describe why work is necessary. Perhaps <span data-type="term" id="auto_839157c1-138c-462c-acb7-3c88f19cbd2f_term-00001" group-by="w">work</span> could be more meaningfully defined as an activity that produces something of value for other people. This definition broadens the scope of work and emphasizes the social context in which the wage-effort bargain transpires. It clearly recognizes that work has purpose&#x2014;it is productive. Of course, this is not to say that work is necessarily interesting or rewarding or satisfying. On the contrary, we know that many jobs are dull, repetitive, and stressful. Even so, the activities performed do have utility for society at large. One of the challenges of <strong data-effect="bold">management</strong> is to discover ways of transforming necessary yet distasteful jobs into more meaningful situations that are more satisfying and rewarding for individuals and that still contribute to organizational productivity and effectiveness.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Functions of Work</h3>
          <p id="auto_839157c1-138c-462c-acb7-3c88f19cbd2f_fs-idm204124464">We know why work activities are important from an organization&#x2019;s viewpoint. Without work there is no product or service to provide. But why is work important to individuals? What functions does it serve?</p>
          <p id="auto_839157c1-138c-462c-acb7-3c88f19cbd2f_fs-idm210378496">First, work serves a rather obvious economic function. In exchange for labor, individuals receive necessary income with which to support themselves and their families. But people work for many reasons beyond simple economic necessity.</p>
          <p id="auto_839157c1-138c-462c-acb7-3c88f19cbd2f_fs-idm204349392">Second, work also serves several social functions. The workplace provides opportunities for meeting new people and developing friendships. Many people spend more time at work with their co-workers than they spend at home with their own families.</p>
          <p id="auto_839157c1-138c-462c-acb7-3c88f19cbd2f_fs-idm204224768">Third, work also provides a source of social status in the community. One&#x2019;s occupation is a clue to how one is regarded on the basis of standards of importance prescribed by the community. For instance, in the United States a corporate president is generally accorded greater status than a janitor in the same corporation. In China, on the other hand, great status is ascribed to peasants and people from the working class, whereas managers are not so significantly differentiated from those they manage. In Japan, status is first a function of the company you work for and how well-known it is, and then the position you hold. It is important to note here that the status associated with the work we perform often transcends the boundaries of our organization. A corporate president or a university president may have a great deal of status in the community at large because of his position in the organization. Hence, the work we do can simultaneously represent a source of social differentiation and a source of social integration.</p>
          <p id="auto_839157c1-138c-462c-acb7-3c88f19cbd2f_fs-idm206960704">Fourth, work can be an important source of identity and self-esteem and, for some, a means for self-actualization. It provides a sense of purpose for individuals and clarifies their value or contribution to society. As Freud noted long ago, &#x201C;Work has a greater effect than any other technique of living in binding the individual more closely to reality; in his work he is at least securely attached to a part of reality, the human community.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_839157c1-138c-462c-acb7-3c88f19cbd2f_ch01rfin-2" data-type="cite" id="auto_839157c1-138c-462c-acb7-3c88f19cbd2f_cite-00002"><sup class="os-citation-number">2</sup></a> Work contributes to self-esteem in at least two ways. First, it provides individuals with an opportunity to demonstrate competence or mastery over themselves and their environment. Individuals discover that they can actually <em data-effect="italics">do</em> something. Second, work reassures individuals that they are carrying out activities that produce something of value to others&#x2014;that they have something significant to offer. Without this, the individual feels that they have little to contribute and is thus of little value to society.</p>
          <p id="auto_839157c1-138c-462c-acb7-3c88f19cbd2f_fs-idm188880736">We clearly can see that work serves several useful purposes from an individual&#x2019;s standpoint. It provides a degree of economic self-sufficiency, social interchange, social status, self-esteem, and identity. Without this, individuals often experience sensations of powerlessness, meaninglessness, and normlessness&#x2014;a condition called <span data-type="term" id="auto_839157c1-138c-462c-acb7-3c88f19cbd2f_term-00002" group-by="a">alienation</span>. In work, individuals have the possibility of finding some meaning in their day-to-day activities&#x2014;if, of course, their work is sufficiently challenging. When employees are not involved in their jobs because the work is not challenging enough, they usually see no reason to apply themselves, which, of course, jeopardizes productivity and organizational effectiveness. This self-evident truth has given rise to a general concern among managers about declining productivity and work values. In fact, concern about this situation has caused many managers to take a renewed interest in how the behavioral sciences can help them solve many of the problems of people at work.</p>

As one recent study concluded, &#x201C;The United States is a competitive location to the extent that firms operating in the U.S. are able to compete successfully in the global economy while supporting high and rising living standards for the average American. Although the U.S. retains profound competitive strengths&#x2014;for instance, in higher education and entrepreneurship&#x2014;those strengths are increasingly threatened by weaknesses in areas such as the tax code, basic education, macroeconomic policies, and regulation.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_ch01rfin-3" data-type="cite" id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_cite-00001"><sup class="os-citation-number">3</sup></a> Companies face a variety of changes and challenges that will have a profound impact on organizational dynamics and performance. In fact, in many ways these changes and challenges will determine who will survive and prosper into the next century and who will not. Among these challenges are the following:</p>
        <section data-depth="1" id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm218351600">
          <h3 data-type="title">The Challenge of International Competition</h3>
          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm225021968">Until the 1980s, many American firms had little in the way of serious international competition. As a result, there was little incentive to innovate and remain efficient and competitive. Many companies became lazy and lost touch with their customers. This situation changed abruptly as companies in Asia and Western Europe developed more sophisticated products and marketing systems and gained significant market shares in home electronics, automobiles, medical equipment, telecommunications, and shipbuilding, to name a few areas. As a result, American companies lost considerable clout&#x2014;and profitability. In the 1990s and into the new millennium, the lowering of trade barriers and acceptance of trade agreements like NAFTA led corporations to seek less expensive labor overseas. This led to lower costs and the ability to offer products at more competitive prices, but also led to a drop in manufacturing in industries like steel production, a drop in manufacturing of products like iPhones, and the relocation of call centers from the U.S. to India.</p>
          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm223199872">If we examine corporate behavior during the early decades of the new millennium, it is not difficult to see some of the reasons for the demise. In short, many North American firms lost their <span data-type="term" id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_term-00001" group-by="i">industrial competitiveness</span>; that is, they lost their capacity to compete effectively in global markets, or they chose to locate in foreign countries as a way to broaden their reach and become more competitive. Consider the following examples:<a href="#auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_ch01rfin-4" data-type="cite" id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_cite-00002"><sup class="os-citation-number">4</sup></a></p>
          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm215179072">During the last year reported, India experienced a 7.5 percent <em data-effect="italics">annual growth rate in real GDP</em> while China recorded an increase of<em data-effect="italics"><!-- no-selfclose --></em> 6.7 percent. This is a measure of how economies are progressing. Great Britain, France, and Italy all had close to 2 percent increases. At the same time, however, the United States recorded a 3.8 percent annual increase (and Canada had a 3 percent increase), a larger increase after a lethargic recovery from the 2009 financial crisis.</p>
          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm217200480">While traditional jobs have shifted to developing countries, countries like the United States and Canada have transformed their economies by incorporating more <span data-type="term" id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_term-00002" group-by="t">technology</span> and automation as well as having a greater proportion of the workforce in the service sectors. It is anticipated that the coming decades will continue to bring disruption to traditional workplace skills that will result in challenging workers to continually evolve their skills.</p>
          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm214585648">Finally, the number of products that were <em data-effect="italics">invented in the United States</em> but are now primarily <em data-effect="italics">manufactured overseas</em> has increased dramatically&#x2014;advances in technology are helping the United States regain the top spot in world manufacturing. There had been a significant decline in our manufacturing sector as less expensive labor in markets like India and China led companies to locate factories there. Since 2010, however, the United States has risen from fourth place to second and is expected to claim the spot as the leading nation by 2020. The major reasons for this are: advanced manufacturing capabilities require fewer &#x201C;line workers,&#x201D; and having products produced near their major markets reduces transport and time to market.</p>
          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm212678640">Considering several indicators of the relative competitiveness of economies using seven metrics, the U.S. performs quite well. The seven metrics are institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, health and primary education, higher education and training, goods market efficiency, and labor market efficiency. When taking all of these factors into consideration (see <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_ch01tab01" class="autogenerated-content">Table 1.1</a></strong>), the United States ranks very well and has an environment of stable growth. One challenge is that workers will need to be nimble and evolve as new skills arise and will need to embrace continuous education and training as a way of managing their careers.</p>

Greater competitiveness requires an understanding of individuals, groups, and entire organizational systems. Throughout this course, we shall see numerous examples of how companies from around the world are meeting the challenges of global competition. Particular emphasis will be placed on management practices in other countries as a point of comparison.</p>

          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm220128384">Although it is common to think of &#x201C;high tech&#x201D; as applying only to the aerospace and telecommunications industries, advanced technologies can be found throughout most industries. For example, most of us are familiar with the explosive growth in computing. Both hardware and software change so rapidly that it is difficult for many companies to keep up. Personal computers are being replaced by cell phones that are now faster and more powerful than their predecessors. Cloud computing and access to big data and applications transform data into useful information that is increasingly complex and increasingly user friendly. In November of 1971 Intel launched the first microchip. Today, a modern Intel Skylake processor contains around 1.75 billion transistors&#x2014;half a million of them would fit on a single transistor from the 4004&#x2014;and collectively they deliver about 400,000 times as much computing muscle.<a href="#auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_ch01rfin-5" data-type="cite" id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_cite-00003"><sup class="os-citation-number">5</sup></a> More and more companies are using computer-based systems and equipment&#x2014;such as e-mail, real-time messaging and file sharing, PDAs, and cell phones&#x2014;for communications. As a result, the way in which employees and managers communicate and make decisions is changing dramatically, and the importance of educated and knowledgeable workers is increasing rapidly.</p>
          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm225109456">Technological changes also can be seen in the increased use of robotics, expert systems, and computer-integrated manufacturing systems, which have changed the way many products are manufactured today. Such changes affect not only production efficiency and product quality but also the nature of jobs. In many industries, the first-line supervisors are disappearing and being replaced by self-managing work teams who assume responsibility for production scheduling, quality control, and even performance appraisals. All of these technological changes require managers who are capable of effectively implementing technological change in the workplace&#x2014;managers who can adapt to the technological imperative while still maintaining and developing the organization&#x2019;s human resources. We will examine the role of technology as it relates to organization structure, job design, communication, decision-making, and work-related stress. We will see how some companies successfully adapted to technological change in a way that benefited all parties concerned.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">The Challenge of Increased Quality</h3>
          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm224165280">The challenge of industrial competitiveness incorporates several interrelated factors, including an appropriate product mix, manufacturing efficiency, effective cost controls, investment in research and development, and so forth. Not to be ignored in this pursuit is the quest for increased quality control of the products and services offered in the marketplace. Total Quality Management (TQM) is a term often used to describe comprehensive efforts to monitor and improve all aspects of quality within a firm. BMW established and continues to maintain its reputation in part because customers have come to respect its high level of quality. Quality is also a major reason for the success of many Japanese products in North America. Simply put, if companies are going to compete, renewed efforts must be devoted to enhanced quality assurance. This, too, is a management challenge. How can managers get employees to care about the products they produce or the services they offer? In this book, we will consider both the issue of quality control (what is it?) and mechanisms of ensuring improved product quality (how do we get it?).</p>
          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm211966080">Moreover, quality control includes several organizational issues. For instance, how can managers get parties who are traditionally independently associated with a product to work together to build a better product? That is, how can they get the design staff, manufacturing engineers, workers, suppliers&#x2014;and potential customers&#x2014;to come together and cooperate in developing and manufacturing a superior product? Later in the book we will examine several instances in which such teamwork played a major role in quality improvement.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">The Challenge of Employee Motivation and Commitment</h3>
          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm220199152">A major hurdle in the pursuit of industrial competitiveness is the traditional adversarial relationship between management and workers. Whether a company is unionized or not, we see situations in which the average employee simply sees no reason to increase output or to improve the quality of existing outputs. Frequently, the company&#x2019;s reward system restricts, rather than increases, performance. At other times, rewards encourage employees to increase quantity at the expense of quality. Furthermore, North American companies often view their workforce as a variable expense (in contrast to Japan, where the workforce is viewed as a fixed expense) and lay workers off when they are not needed for short-run activities. As a result, returning the favor, employees see little reason to be committed or loyal to their employers. Turnover and absenteeism rates are often unreasonably high, further eroding performance efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm226272080">If companies are to succeed in an increasingly turbulent environment, managers must discover better ways to develop and motivate employees. A company&#x2019;s human resources often represent its biggest single asset, and failing to properly nurture this asset leads to suboptimal return on an organization&#x2019;s resources. Part of solving this problem involves knowing and understanding today&#x2019;s employees. <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_ch01fig02" class="autogenerated-content">Exhibit 1.2</a></strong> illustrates the various characteristics employees consider important in their employers.

Growth also can be expected in engineering and managerial positions. These changes require a new look at how such employees are motivated. For example, do we motive an engineer the same way we motivate a sales representative? How do we motivate senior executives as opposed to junior managers? In this book, we shall touch on these issues when we examine approaches to employee motivation. Managers have at their disposal several ways in which to increase employee motivation and performance, and an effective manager learns how and when to use each approach.</p>

          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm214586640">Historically, the American economy has been dominated by White males. They have filled the vast majority of managerial positions and many of the more important blue-collar jobs, becoming skilled craftsmen. Traditionally, women filled lower-paying clerical positions and often left the workforce to raise their families. Minorities of both genders found considerable barriers to entering the labor market at the higher (and higher-paying) levels. Now, things are changing, and the pace of this change is accelerating. Among other changes, the twenty-first century will also bring major changes in terms of workforce demographics. We will see changes in gender, race, and age.</p>

In general, there are more women in positions of responsibility in both the public and private sectors and more opportunities for minorities. Some predict that the coming labor shortage will cause many companies to try to retain older workers for longer periods of time, beyond the traditional retirement age. Additionally, the belief that mentally or physically challenged individuals can play productive roles at work is increasing. Such changes bring opportunities for companies but also potential problems of adjustment if not managed intelligently. We will examine several of these issues when we discuss careers and employee development.</p>

          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm212406192">Finally, the future will bring a renewed concern with maintaining high standards of ethical behavior in business transactions and in the workplace. Many executives and social scientists see unethical behavior as a cancer working on the fabric of society both in business and beyond. Many are concerned that we face a crisis of ethics in the West that is undermining our competitive strength. This crisis involves business, government, customers, and employees. Especially worrisome is unethical behavior among employees at all levels of the organization. For example, recent reports found that employees and vendors accounted for a higher percentage of thefts than did retail customers.<a href="#auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_ch01rfin-7" data-type="cite" id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_cite-00005"><sup class="os-citation-number">7</sup></a></p>

John Schnatter, founder and chairman of Papa John&#x2019;s Pizza, found this out the hard way. During a media training conference call, Schnatter used derogatory comments and racial slurs. This call, although intended to be a role-playing exercise, quickly turned into a bad dream for Schnatter. In response to this action, and having admitted the fault, Schnatter was forced to resign as chairman after the local NAACP branch called for his resignation. In addition, the board of directors decided that he would be removed from all marketing, publicity, and pizza boxes, and they took the stance that &#x201C;Papa John&#x2019;s is not an individual. Papa John&#x2019;s is a pizza company with 120,000 corporate and franchise team members around the world&#x201D; (Forbes 2018). Shares of stock for Papa John&#x2019;s soared after the announcement of his resignation, adding $50 million to Schnatter&#x2019;s total net worth (CNN Money 2018). The values of the company prevailed through the actions of Schnatter, showcasing that despite making a mistake, the commitment to maintaining an ethical standard is still an important value to Schnatter as well as the company overall.</p>

Although such practices occur throughout the world, their presence nonetheless serves to remind us of the challenges we face.</p>
          <p id="auto_603e6267-5f5b-4c47-8a43-f97ceb8cc690_fs-idm228433968">This challenge is especially difficult because standards for what constitutes ethical behavior lie in a &#x201C;gray zone&#x201D; where clear-cut right-or-wrong answers may not always exist. For example, if you were a sales representative for an American company abroad and your foreign competitors used bribes to get business, what would you do? In the United States such behavior is illegal, yet it is perfectly acceptable in other countries. What is ethical here? Similarly, in many countries women are systematically discriminated against in the workplace; it is felt that their place is in the home. In the United States, again, this practice is illegal. If you ran an American company in one of these countries, would you hire women in important positions? If you did, your company might be isolated in the larger business community, and you might lose business. If you did not, you might be violating what most Americans believe to be fair business practices.</p>

With effective management, contemporary companies can accomplish a great deal toward becoming more competitive in the global environment. On the other hand, ineffective management dooms the organization to mediocrity and sometimes outright failure. Because of this, we turn now to a look at the nature of management. However, we want to point out that even though our focus is on managers, what we discuss is also relevant to the actions of nonmanagers. On the basis of this examination, we should be ready to begin our analysis of what managers can learn from the behavioral sciences to improve their effectiveness in a competitive environment.</p>

Rather, different managers serve different roles and carry different responsibilities, depending upon where they are in the organizational hierarchy. We will begin by looking at several of the variations in managerial work.</p>

The two most salient perceptions of a manager are (1) the manager&#x2019;s level in the organizational hierarchy and (2) the type of department or function for which they are responsible. Let us briefly consider each of these.</p>

Senior executives will devote more of their time to conceptual issues, while first-line managers will concentrate their efforts on technical issues. For example, top managers rate high on such activities as <span data-type="term" id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_term-00005" group-by="l">long-range planning</span>, monitoring business indicators, coordinating, and internal consulting. Lower-level managers, by contrast, rate high on supervising because their responsibility is to accomplish tasks through rank-and-file employees. Middle managers rate near the middle for all activities. We can distinguish three types of managerial skills:<a href="#auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_ch01rfin-8" data-type="cite" id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_cite-00001"><sup class="os-citation-number">8</sup></a></p>

            <li><em data-effect="italics">Technical skills</em>. Managers must have the ability to use the tools, procedures, and techniques of their special areas. An accountant must have expertise in accounting principles, whereas a production manager must know operations management. These skills are the mechanics of the job.</li>
            <li><em data-effect="italics">Human relations skills</em>. Human relations skills involve the ability to work with people and understand employee motivation and group processes. These skills allow the manager to become involved with and lead his or her group.</li>
            <li><em data-effect="italics">Conceptual skills</em>. These skills represent a manager&#x2019;s ability to organize and analyze information in order to improve organizational performance. They include the ability to see the organization as a whole and to understand how various parts fit together to work as an integrated unit. These skills are required to coordinate the departments and divisions successfully so that the entire organization can pull together.</li>

          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm354726368">As shown in <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_ch01fig07" class="autogenerated-content">Exhibit 1.7</a></strong>, different levels of these skills are required at different stages of the managerial hierarchy. That is, success in executive positions requires far more conceptual skill and less use of technical skills in most (but not all) situations, whereas first-line managers generally require more technical skills and fewer conceptual skills. Note, however, that human or people skills remain important for success at all three levels in the hierarchy.</p>

There are differences found for quality assurance, manufacturing, marketing, accounting and finance, and human resource management departments. For instance, manufacturing department managers will concentrate their efforts on products and services, controlling, and supervising. Marketing managers, in comparison, focus less on planning, coordinating, and consulting but more on customer relations and external contact. Managers in both accounting and human resource management departments rate high on long-range planning, but will spend less time on the organization&#x2019;s products and service offerings. Managers in accounting and finance are also concerned with controlling and with monitoring performance indicators, while human resource managers provide consulting expertise, coordination, and external contacts. The emphasis on and intensity of managerial activities varies considerably by the department the manager is assigned to.</p>
          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm361459120">At a personal level, knowing that the mix of conceptual, human, and technical skills changes over time and that different functional areas require different levels of specific management activities can serve at least two important functions. First, if you choose to become a manager, knowing that the mix of skills changes over time can help you avoid a common complaint that often young employees want to think and act like a CEO before they have mastered being a first-line supervisor. Second, knowing the different mix of management activities by functional area can facilitate your selection of an area or areas that best match your skills and interests.</p>
          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm351803680">In many firms, managers are rotated through departments as they move up in the hierarchy. In this way they obtain a well-rounded perspective on the responsibilities of the various departments. In their day-to-day tasks they must emphasize the right activities for their departments and their managerial levels. Knowing what types of activity to emphasize is the core of the manager&#x2019;s job. In any event, we shall return to this issue when we address the nature of individual differences in the next chapter.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">The Twenty-First Century Manager</h3>
          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm362677024">We discussed above many of the changes and challenges facing organizations in the twenty-first century. Because of changes such as these, the managers and executives of tomorrow will have to change their approaches to their jobs if they are to succeed in meeting the new challenges. In fact, their profiles may even look somewhat different than they often do today. Consider the five skills that <em data-effect="italics">Fast Company</em> predicts that successful future managers, compared to the senior manager in the year 2000, will need. The five skills are: the ability to think of new solutions, being comfortable with chaos, an understanding of technology, high emotional intelligence, and the ability to work with people and technology together.</p>
          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm351994336">For the past several decades, executive profiles have typically looked like this: The person started out in finance with an undergraduate degree in accounting, then methodically worked their way up through the company from the controller&#x2019;s office in a division, to running that division, to the top job. The military background shows. They are used to giving orders&#x2014;and to having them obeyed. As head of the philanthropic efforts, they are important in the community. However, the first time the individual traveled overseas on business was as chief executive. Computers, which became ubiquitous, make them nervous.<a href="#auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_ch01rfin-9" data-type="cite" id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_cite-00002"><sup class="os-citation-number">9</sup></a></p>
          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm353243904">Now compare this with predictions about what a twenty-first-century executive will look like:</p>
          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm360674784">Their undergraduate degree might be in French literature, but they also have a joint MBA/engineering degree. The individual started in research and was quickly picked out as a potential CEO. They are able to think creatively and thrives in a chaotic environment. They zigzagged from research to marketing to finance, are comfortable with technology and people, and have a high degree of emotional intelligence. The executive proved valuable in Brazil by turning around a failing joint venture. This person speaks multiple languages and is on a first-name basis with commerce ministers in half a dozen countries.</p>
          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm352404528">Clearly, the future holds considerable excitement and promise for future managers and executives who are properly prepared to meet the challenges. How do we prepare them? One study suggested that the manager of the future must be able to fill at least the following four roles:<a href="#auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_ch01rfin-10" data-type="cite" id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_cite-00003"><sup class="os-citation-number">10</sup></a></p>

They must have a capacity to identify unique business opportunities and then move quickly to exploit them.</p>
          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm353192416"><strong data-effect="bold">Master of technology.</strong> Executives and managers of the future must be able to get the most out of emerging technologies, whether these technologies are in manufacturing, communications, marketing, or other areas.</p>
          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm361740512"><strong data-effect="bold">Leadership that embraces vulnerability.</strong> The successful executive of the future will understand how to cut through red tape to get a job done, how to build bridges with key people from highly divergent backgrounds and points of view, and how to make coalitions and joint ventures work.</p>
          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm352406528"><strong data-effect="bold">Follow-from-the-front motivator.</strong> Finally, the executive of tomorrow must understand group dynamics and how to counsel, coach, and command work teams and individuals so they perform at their best. Future organizations will place greater emphasis on teams and coordinated efforts, requiring managers to understand participative management techniques.</p>
          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm362687888"><strong data-effect="bold">Great communicator.</strong> To this list of four, we would add that managers of the future must be great communicators. They must be able to communicate effectively with an increasingly diverse set of employees as well as customers, suppliers, and community and government leaders.</p>
          <p id="auto_4dc885e6-e91b-4d9a-9db7-96cc69c05e81_fs-idm351444048">Whether these predictions are completely accurate is difficult to know. Suffice it to say that most futurists agree that the organizational world of the twenty-first century will likely resemble, to some extent, the portrait described here. The task for future managers, then, is to attempt to develop these requisite skills to the extent possible so they will be ready for the challenges of the next decade.</p>

          <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm345496368">The study of the behavior of people in organizations is typically referred to as <em data-effect="italics">organizational behavior</em>. Here, the focus is on applying what we can learn from the social and behavioral sciences so we can better understand and predict human behavior at work. We examine such behavior on three levels&#x2014;the individual, the group, and the organization as a whole. In all three cases, we seek to learn more about what causes people&#x2014;individually or collectively&#x2014;to behave as they do in organizational settings. What motivates people? What makes some employees leaders and others not? Why do groups often work in opposition to their employer? How do organizations respond to changes in their external environments? How do people communicate and make decisions? Questions such as these constitute the domain of organizational behavior and are the focus of this course.</p>
          <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm340710464">To a large extent, we can apply what has been learned from psychology, sociology, and cultural anthropology. In addition, we can learn from economics and political science. All of these disciplines have something to say about life in organizations. However, what sets organizational behavior apart is its particular focus on the organization (not the discipline) in organizational analysis (see <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_ch01fig08" class="autogenerated-content">Exhibit 1.8</a></strong>). Thus, if we wish to examine a problem of employee motivation, for example, we can draw upon economic theories of wage structures in the workplace. At the same time, we can also draw on the psychological theories of motivation and incentives as they relate to work. We can bring in sociological treatments of social forces on behavior, and we can make use of anthropological studies of cultural influences on individual performance. It is this conceptual richness that establishes organizational behavior as a unique applied discipline. And throughout our analyses, we are continually concerned with the implications of what we learn for the quality of working life and organizational performance. We always look for management implications so the managers of the future can develop more humane and more competitive organizations for the future.</p>

Although there are times when this distinction is helpful, it is always important to remember that in most instances we learn the most when we take a comprehensive view of organizational behavior and integrate these two perspectives. That is, issues such as organization structure can influence employee motivation. Hence, by keeping these two realms separate we lose valuable information that can help us better understand how to manage organizations.</p>

              <span class="os-caption">Xinyu Liu was hired as the studio as a designer at Invo, a Massachusetts-based firm. Prior to joining Invo, she was a user experience researcher at Samsung, where she investigated how to apply future technologies in everyday living. Changing behavior for good was a key component of the R&amp;D work, leveraging invisible sensing tech, devising emotional effects, and crafting just-in-time graphic communication. Her wide-ranging skills, from analyzing social behavior to 3D modeling to electronics to UI design, are well-suited for the multi-domain projects at Invo. As part of the employee selection process, the hiring managers at Invo needed to recognize that their employees come from various backgrounds and have varying abilities and skills, differing motivational levels, and different ambitions. Within the organizational context, they needed to consider how Xinyu would fit on the team in the areas of communication, decision-making, and leadership, and how she would handle power and organizational politics as she carried out her responsibilities.

          <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm351348192">Understanding the behavior of people at work is fundamental to the effective management of an organization. Obviously, a number of factors come together to determine this behavior and its organizational consequences. In order to understand the origins and characteristics of these factors, it is necessary to have a model that organizes and simplifies the variables involved. We offer such a model here in the hope that it will bring some order to the study of this subject. The model can be considered in two parts (see <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_ch01fig10" class="autogenerated-content">Exhibit 1.10</a></strong>).</p>

That is, organizations receive inputs from the external environment in the form of capital, raw materials, labor, community or government support, and so forth. In addition, organizations experience or produce certain outcomes, including (1) organizational goal attainment, (2) group performance and effectiveness, and (3) individual performance and effectiveness. Thus, organizations and the people in them exist in a constant state of flux, receiving and transforming inputs from the environment and returning those transformed inputs in the form of finished goods and services, return on stockholders&#x2019; equity, salaries that are paid to employees, and so forth. It is, in short, a dynamic system.</p>
          <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm351679952">The second aspect of the model is the organization itself and all of its parts. One way to understand the complexity of organizations is to think of them simply as a set of building blocks, including:</p>

Their members come from various backgrounds and have varying abilities and skills, differing motivational levels, and different ambitions. Within the organizational context, these people must communicate, make decisions, show leadership, and handle power and organizational politics as they carry out their assigned activities.</p>
          <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm349886144"><strong data-effect="bold">Tasks and technology.</strong> In addition to variations among individuals and groups, we must recognize variations in the technology of the workplace. That is, how does the work actually get done? Technology includes both the actual design of jobs and the tools and techniques used in manufacture (e.g., robotics and expert systems).</p>

That is, how do we structure an organization so it effectively coordinates and controls employee behavior to facilitate performance?</p>

The processes largely determine the nature and quality of interpersonal and intergroup relations within the workplace and, as such, influence ultimate organizational performance.</p>

Throughout this text, we shall see numerous examples of how the degree of managerial effectiveness and prowess have determined the success or failure of a venture. We shall take a managerial view throughout our survey of organizational behavior.</p>
          <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm341554304">There have been many attempts to provide a differentiation between leadership and management over time. While they are not the same thing, they are necessarily linked, and complementary. Any effort to separate the two is likely to cause more problems than it solves and as business evolved the content of leadership and management has changed. The emergence of the &#x201C;knowledge worker,&#x201D; and the profound differences that this causes the way business is organized. With the rise of the knowledge worker, one does not &#x2018;manage&#x2019; people, and instead the task is to lead people and the goal is to make productive the specific strengths and knowledge of every individual.</p>

We shall proceed sequentially, beginning with individual behavior and moving to group and intergroup behavior and finally to organization design and structure. On the basis of this, we will turn to a consideration of several of the more important organizational processes. Finally, we will look to the future and examine ways that organizations can continue to develop and improve their workforces and the organization as a whole. Throughout, the roles of technology and management will be considered.

Work may be defined as an activity that produces something of value for other people. Work serves several functions, including economic, social, status, self-esteem, and self-actualization. As managers in today&#x2019;s environment, several challenges arise, including international competition, new technologies, the need for increased quality, employee motivation and commitment, a diverse workforce, and ethical behavior. These challenges must be met by managers concerned about survival and competitiveness in the future.</p>

Managerial responsibilities include long-range planning, controlling, environmental scanning, supervision, coordination, customer relations, community relations, internal consulting, and monitoring of products and services. These responsibilities differ by level in the organizational hierarchy and by department or function. The twenty-first-century manager will differ from most current managers in four ways. In essence, they will be a global strategist, a master of technology, a good politician, and a premier leader-motivator.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">New Management Challenges for the New Age</h4>
            <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm341424416">Today&#x2019;s news is littered with scandals, new allegations of sexual assault, and tragedy. Since 2017 and the #metoo movement, stemming from the Harvey Weinstein scandal, more and more public figures have been put into the spotlight to defend themselves against allegations from women around the globe.</p>
            <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm341461344">Not only publicly, but privately in companies around the world, there have been firings and investigations into misconduct from coworkers, managers, and CEOs. It is a relevant topic that is getting long-overdue publicity and encouraging more men and women to come forward to discuss openly rather than hide the events and injustices of the past. Other events showcase the tumultuous and on-edge society we are living in, such as the Charlottesville, VA, attack that left one dead and 19 injured when a person drove a car through a crowd of protestors during a White nationalist gathering.</p>
            <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm341474800">With unanticipated events on a daily business, it is important for companies to take a stand against racial hatred and harassment of any kind, and to have firm policies when such events occur. Take Netflix, for example, who in July 2018 fired their chief communications officer for saying the &#x201C;N-word&#x201D; in full form. This event occurred during an internal meeting in which the speaker was not directing the slur at anyone specific, but claimed it was being made as an emphatic point about offensive words in comedy programming. The &#x201C;Netflix way,&#x201D; the culture that is built around radical candor and transparency, was put to the test during this occurrence.</p>
            <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm346782544">The offender, Jonathan Friedland, attempted to apologize for his misdeed, hoping it would fade away and his apology would be accepted. However, it didn&#x2019;t work that way; instead, the anger was palpable between coworkers and eventually led to the firing of Friedland after a few months of inaction.</p>
            <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm347053600">Netflixers are given a high level of freedom and responsibility within their &#x201C;Netflix way&#x201D; culture. Blunt feedback is encouraged, and trust and discretion are the ultimate gatekeeper, as employees have access to sensitive information and are ultimately trusted for how they expense items and take vacation time.</p>
            <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm350185632">In the insanely fast-paced streaming-services industry, it is hard to keep this culture at a premium, but it is imperative for the success of the company overall. &#x201C;As you scale a company to become bigger and bigger, how do you scale that kind of culture?&#x201D; said Colin Estep, a former senior engineer who left voluntarily in 2016. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know that we ever had a good answer.&#x201D;</p>
            <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm343601104">In order to keep up, sometimes the company is seen as harsh in their tactics to keep the best of the best. &#x201C;I think we&#x2019;re transparent to a fault in our culture and that can come across as cutthroat,&#x201D; said Walta Nemariam, an employee in talent acquisition at Netflix.</p>
            <p id="auto_ffa1430c-6177-4e6c-b7e9-786c1a271aec_fs-idm352684976">Netflix has stayed true to their cultural values despite the pressures and sometimes negative connotations associated with this &#x201C;cutthroat&#x201D; environment. Their ability to remain agile, while displaying no tolerance for societal injustices, puts them at the forefront of new-age companies. It is a difficult pace to stay in line with, but it seems that they are keeping in stride and remaining true to who they are, for now.</p>

      <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm327949360">Students of management often complain about &#x201C;theoretical&#x201D; or &#x201C;abstract&#x201D; approaches to a subject; they argue instead in favor of &#x201C;relevant&#x201D; and &#x201C;applied&#x201D; approaches. The feeling is that there usually exist two distinct ways to study a topic, and from a managerial standpoint, a focus on application is the preferred way. Serious reflection about this problem may suggest a somewhat different approach, however. Consider the following situation.</p>
      <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm329058928">As a personnel manager for a medium-sized firm, you have been asked to discover why employee turnover in your firm is so high. Your boss has told you that it is your responsibility to assess this problem and then to offer suggestions aimed at reducing turnover. What will you do? Several possible strategies come to mind:</p>
      <ul id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm340275552" data-bullet-style="none" class="no-style">
        <li>Talk with those who have quit the organization.</li>
        <li>Talk with those who remain.</li>
        <li>Talk to the employees&#x2019; supervisors.</li>
        <li>Consult with personnel managers in other companies.</li>
        <li>Measure job satisfaction.</li>
        <li>Examine company policies and practices.</li>
        <li>Examine the jobs where most turnover occurs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm340293680">None of these actions will likely be very successful in helping you arrive at sound conclusions, however. Talking with those who have left usually yields a variety of biased responses by those who either want to &#x201C;get back at&#x201D; the company or who fear that criticism will negatively affect their chances for future recommendations. Talking with those still employed has similar problems: why <em data-effect="italics">should</em> they be candid and jeopardize their jobs? Talking with supervisors will not help if they themselves are the problem. Asking other personnel managers, while comforting, ignores major differences between organizations. Measuring job satisfaction, examining company policies, or examining the jobs themselves may help if one is fortunate enough to hit upon the right problem, but the probability of doing so is minimal. In short, many of the most obvious ways a manager can choose to solve a problem may yield biased results at best, and possibly no results at all.</p>
      <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm326674048">A more viable approach would be to view the situation from a research standpoint and to use accepted methods of scientific inquiry to arrive at a solution that minimizes biased results. Most of what we know about organizational behavior results from efforts to apply such methods in solving organizational problems (e.g., How do we motivate employees? How do we develop effective leaders? How do we reduce stress at work?). An awareness of the nature of scientific inquiry is useful for understanding how we learned what we know about organizations as well as in facilitating efforts to solve behavioral problems at work.</p>

        <h2 data-type="title">Theory Building in Organizations</h2>
        <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm333889968">Briefly stated, a <em data-effect="italics">theory</em> is a set of statements that serves to explain the manner in which certain concepts or variables are related. These statements result both from our present level of knowledge on the topic and from our assumptions about the variables themselves. The theory allows us to deduce logical propositions, or hypotheses, that can be tested in the field or laboratory. In short, a theory is a technique that helps us understand how variables fit together. Their use in research and in management is invaluable.</p>
        <section data-depth="2" id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm343997088">
          <h3 data-type="title">Uses of a Theory</h3>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm326687536">Why do we have theories in the study of organizational behavior? First, theories help us <em data-effect="italics">organize</em> knowledge about a given subject into a pattern of relationships that lends meaning to a series of observed events. They provide a structure for understanding. For instance, rather than struggling with a lengthy list of factors found to relate to employee turnover, a theory of turnover might suggest how such factors fit together and are related.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm338156416">Second, theories help us to <em data-effect="italics">summarize</em> diverse findings so that we can focus on major relationships and not get bogged down in details. A theory &#x201C;permits us to handle large amounts of empirical data with relatively few propositions.&#x201D; [M. E. Shaw and P. R. Costanzo, <em data-effect="italics">Theories of Social Psychology</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1970), p. 9.]</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm346215904">Finally, theories are useful in that they <em data-effect="italics">point the way</em> to future research efforts. They raise new questions and suggest answers. In this sense, they serve a useful heuristic value in helping to differentiate between important and trivial questions for future research. Theories are useful both for the study and for the management of organizations. As Kurt Lewin said, &#x201C;There is nothing so practical as a good theory.&#x201D;</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">What Is a Good Theory?</h3>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm317183072">Abraham Kaplan discusses in detail the criteria for evaluating the utility or soundness of a theory. [A. Kaplan, <em data-effect="italics">The Conduct of Inquiry</em> (San Francisco: Chandler, 1964).] At least five such criteria can be mentioned:</p>
          <ol id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm342685728">
            <li><em data-effect="italics">Internal consistency.</em> Are the propositions central to the theory free from contradiction? Are they logical?</li>
            <li><em data-effect="italics">External consistency.</em> Are the propositions of a theory consistent with observations from real life?</li>
            <li><em data-effect="italics">Scientific parsimony.</em> Does the theory contain only those concepts that are necessary to account for findings or to explain relationships? Simplicity of presentation is preferable unless added complexity furthers understanding or clarifies additional research findings.</li>
            <li><em data-effect="italics">Generalizability.</em> In order for a theory to have much utility, it must apply to a wide range of situations or organizations. A theory of employee motivation that applies only to one company hardly helps us understand motivational processes or apply such knowledge elsewhere.</li>
            <li><em data-effect="italics">Verification.</em> A good theory presents propositions that can be tested. Without an ability to operationalize the variables and subject the theory to field or laboratory testing, we are unable to determine its accuracy or utility.</li>
          </ol>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm341236080">To the extent that a theory satisfies these requirements, its usefulness both to researchers and to managers is enhanced. However, a theory is only a starting point. On the basis of theory, researchers and problem solvers can proceed to design studies aimed at verifying and refining the theories themselves. These studies must proceed according to commonly accepted principles of the scientific method.</p>

        <h2 data-type="title">Scientific Method in Organizational Behavior Research</h2>
        <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm340994112">Cohen and Nagel suggested that there are four basic &#x201C;ways of knowing.&#x201D; [M. Cohen and E. Nagel, <em data-effect="italics">An Introduction to Logic and Scientific Inquiry</em> (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1943). See also E. Lawler, A. Mohrman, S. Mohrman, G. Ledford, and T. Cummings, <em data-effect="italics">Doing Research That Is Useful for Theory and Practice</em> (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1985).] Managers and researchers use all four of these techniques: tenacity, intuition, authority, and science. When managers form a belief (e.g., a happy worker is a productive worker) and continue to hold that belief out of habit and often in spite of contradictory information, they are using <em data-effect="italics">tenacity.</em> They use <em data-effect="italics">intuition</em> when they feel the answer is self-evident or when they have a hunch about how to solve a problem. They use <em data-effect="italics">authority</em> when they seek an answer to a problem from an expert or consultant who supposedly has experience in the area. Finally, they use <em data-effect="italics">science</em>&#x2014;perhaps too seldom&#x2014;when they are convinced that the three previous methods allow for too much subjectivity in interpretation.</p>
        <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm326309824">In contrast to tenacity, intuition, and authority, the scientific method of inquiry &#x201C;aims at knowledge that is <em data-effect="italics">objective</em> in the sense of being intersubjectively certifiable, independent of individual opinion or preference, on the basis of data obtainable by suitable experiments or observations.&#x201D; [C. G. Hempel, <em data-effect="italics">Aspects of Scientific Explanation</em> (New York: The Free Press, 1965), p. 141.] In other words, the scientific approach to problem-solving sets some fairly rigorous standards in an attempt to substitute objectivity for subjectivity.</p>
        <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm317305424">The scientific method in organizational behavior consists of four stages: (1) observation of the phenomena (facts) in the real world, (2) formulation of explanations for such phenomena using the inductive process, (3) generation of predictions or hypotheses about the phenomena using the deductive process, and (4) verification of the predictions or hypotheses using systematic, controlled observation. This process is shown in <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_app01fig01" class="autogenerated-content">Exhibit A1</a></strong>. When this rather abstract description of the steps of scientific inquiry is shown within the framework of an actual research study, the process becomes much clearer. A basic research paradigm is shown in <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_app01fig02" class="autogenerated-content">Exhibit A2</a></strong>. In essence, a scientific approach to research requires that the investigator or manager first recognize clearly what research questions are being posed. To paraphrase Lewis Carroll, if you don&#x2019;t know where you&#x2019;re going, any road will take you there. Many managers identify what they think is a problem (e.g., turnover) only to discover later that their &#x201C;problem&#x201D; turnover rate is much lower than that in comparable industries. Other managers look at poor employee morale or performance and ignore what may be the real problem (e.g., poor leadership).</p>

These hypotheses represent best guesses about what we expect to find. We set forth hypotheses to determine if we can predict the right answer so we can select a study design that allows for suitable testing. On the basis of the study design (to be discussed shortly), we observe the variables under study, analyze the data we collect, and draw relevant conclusions and management implications. When we follow this process, the risks of being guided by our own opinions or prejudices are minimized, and we arrive at useful answers to our original research questions.</p>

        <h2 data-type="title">Basic Research Designs</h2>
        <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm332639744">Although a detailed discussion of the various research designs is beyond the scope of this Appendix, we can review several common research designs that have been used to collect data in the study of people at work. Specifically, we will examine five different research designs that are frequently used to study behavior at work: (1) naturalistic observation, (2) survey research, (3) field study, (4) field experiment, and (5) laboratory experiment. In general, the level of rigor of the design increases as we move from naturalistic observation toward laboratory study. Unfortunately, so do the costs, in many cases.</p>
        <section data-depth="2" id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm315330896">
          <h3 data-type="title">Criteria for Evaluating Research Designs</h3>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm351910112">Before examining the five designs, it will be helpful to consider how a researcher selects from among the various designs. Clearly, no one strategy or design is superior in all cases. Each has its place, depending upon the research goals and the constraints placed on the research.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm325398720">However, when choosing among the potential designs, researchers generally must consider several things. For example, does the design require that you <em data-effect="italics">specify hypotheses</em> a priori? If you specify appropriate hypotheses and are able to confirm them, then you can predict behavior in organizations. As a manager, being able to predict behavior in advance allows you to intervene and make necessary changes to remedy problem situations. The ability to accurately predict behavior is clearly superior to simply being able to explain behavior after the fact.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm325075696">Other factors to examine are the <em data-effect="italics">method of measurement</em> and the <em data-effect="italics">degree of control</em> to be used. Does the method of measurement use qualitative or quantitative measures? Although qualitative measures may be useful for generating future hypotheses, quantitative measures add more perceived rigor to results. Also, if you are interested in demonstrating casual relationships, it is necessary to have a high degree of control over the study variables. You must be able to manipulate the primary study variable to determine the results of this manipulation while at the same time keeping other potentially contaminating variables constant so they do not interfere in the results.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm345704512">In addition, a researcher must know to what extent they can generalize the results from the study to apply to other organizations or situations. Results that are situation-specific are of little use to managers. <em data-effect="italics">External validity</em> is of key importance. And, of course, in practical terms, how much is it going to cost to carry out the study and discover a solution? <em data-effect="italics">Cost</em> can be measured in many ways, including time and money.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm341149424">The analysis of the previous five criteria provides insight concerning the <em data-effect="italics">overall level of rigor</em> of the research design. The more rigorous the design, the more confidence one has in the results. This is because more rigorous designs typically employ more accurate measures or interventions and attempt to control for contaminating influences on study results. With this in mind, we can now consider various research designs.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Naturalistic Observation</h3>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm348845296">Naturalistic observations represent the most primitive (least rigorous) method of research in organizations. Simply put, <em data-effect="italics">naturalistic observations</em> represent conclusions drawn from observing events. At least two forms of such research can be identified: (1) authoritative opinions and (2) case studies.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm344017216"><em data-effect="italics">Authoritative opinions</em> are the opinions of experts in the field. When Henri Fayol wrote his early works on management, for example, he was offering his advice as a former industrial manager. On the basis of experience in real work situations, Fayol and others suggest that what they have learned can be applied to a variety of work organizations with relative ease. Other examples of authoritative opinions can be found in Barnard&#x2019;s <em data-effect="italics">The Functions of the Executive,</em> Sloan&#x2019;s <em data-effect="italics">My Years with General Motors,</em> and Peters and Waterman&#x2019;s <em data-effect="italics">In Search of Excellence.</em> Throughout their works, these writers attempt to draw lessons from their own practical experience that can help other managers assess their problems.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm344936720">The second use of naturalistic observation can be seen in the <em data-effect="italics">case study.</em> Case studies attempt to take one situation in one organization and to analyze it in detail with regard to the interpersonal dynamics among the various members. For instance, we may have a case of one middle manager who appears to have burned out on the job; his performance seems to have reached a plateau. The case would then review the cast of characters in the situation and how each one related to this manager&#x2019;s problem. Moreover, the case would review any actions that were taken to remedy the problem. Throughout, emphasis would be placed on what managers could learn from this one real-life problem that can possibly relate to other situations.</p>

In such cases, the managers (or the researchers) are interested mainly in considering quantitative values of the responses. Questionnaires designed to measure such variables are examples of <em data-effect="italics">survey research.</em> Here we are not attempting to relate results to subsequent events. We simply wish to assess the general feelings and attitudes of employees.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm343551616">Surveys are particularly popular with managers today as a method of assessing relative job attitudes. Hence, we may make an annual attitude survey and track changes in attitudes over time. If attitudes begin to decline, management is alerted to the problem and can take steps to remedy the situation.</p>

          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm341596848">In a <em data-effect="italics">field study,</em> the researcher is interested in the relationship between a <em data-effect="italics">predictor</em> variable (e.g., job satisfaction) and a subsequent <em data-effect="italics">criterion</em> variable (e.g., employee turnover or performance). Measures of each variable are taken (satisfaction, perhaps through a questionnaire, and turnover, from company records) and are compared to determine the extent of correlation. No attempt is made to intervene in the system or to manipulate any of the variables, as is the case with experimental approaches.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm315329184">To continue the simple example we began with, a manager may have a hypothesis that says that satisfaction is a primary indicator of employee turnover. After measuring both, it is found that there is a moderate relationship between the two variables. Hence, the manager may conclude that the two are probably related. Even so, because of the moderate nature of the relationship, it is clear that other factors also influence turnover; otherwise, there would be a much stronger relationship. The manager concludes that, although efforts to improve job satisfaction may help solve the problem, other influences on turnover must also be looked at, such as salary level and supervisory style.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Field Experiment</h3>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm325371888">A <em data-effect="italics">field experiment</em> is much like a field study, with one important exception. Instead of simply measuring job satisfaction, the manager or researcher makes efforts to actually change satisfaction levels. In an experiment, we attempt to manipulate the predictor variable. This is most often done by dividing the sample into two groups: an experimental group and a control group. In the experimental group, we intervene and introduce a major change. Perhaps we alter the compensation program or give supervisors some human relations training. The control group receives no such treatment. After a time, we compare turnover rates in the two groups. If we have identified the correct treatment (that is, a true influence on turnover), turnover rates would be reduced in the experimental group but not in the control group.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm340227872">In other words, in a field experiment, as opposed to a field study, we intentionally change one aspect of the work environment in the experimental group and compare the impact of the change with the untreated control group. Thus, we can be relatively assured that the solution we have identified is, in fact, a true predictor variable and is of use to management.</p>

          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm345518896">We might, for instance, wish to study the effects of various compensation programs (hourly rate versus piece rate) on performance. To do this, we might employ two groups of business students and have both groups work on a simulated work exercise. In doing so, we are simulating a real work situation. Each group would then be paid differently. After the experiment, an assessment would be made of the impact of the two compensation plans on productivity.</p>

          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm349988304">Now that we have reviewed various research designs, we might wonder which designs are best. This is not an easy call. All designs have been used by managers and researchers in studying problems of people at work. Perhaps the question can best be answered by considering the relative strengths and weaknesses of each, on the basis of our earlier discussion of the criteria for evaluating research designs (see <strong data-effect="bold"><a href="#auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_app01tab01" class="autogenerated-content">Table A1</a></strong>). We should then have a better idea of which design or designs would be appropriate for a particular problem or situation.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm332671296"><strong data-effect="bold">Specification of Hypotheses in Advance.</strong> It was noted earlier that the ability to specify a priori hypotheses adds rigor to the study. In general, hypotheses are not given for naturalistic observations or survey research. These two techniques are used commonly for exploratory analyses and for identifying pertinent research questions for more rigorous future study. On the other hand, the remaining three designs (field study, field experiment, and laboratory experiment) do allow explicitly for a priori hypotheses. Hence, they are superior in this sense.</p>

Survey research most often provides for both. Hence, if it is important to collect hard data concerning a problem (e.g., what is the magnitude of the relationship between satisfaction and turnover?), quantitative designs are to be preferred. On the other hand, if one is more concerned about identifying major reasons for turnover and little prior knowledge about the problem exists, qualitative data may be preferred, and survey research may be a better research strategy. The selection of an appropriate design hinges in part on the intended uses for the information.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm318516336"><strong data-effect="bold">Control.</strong> As noted earlier, control represents the extent to which potentially contaminating influences can be minimized in a study. Clearly, experimental procedures allow for better control than do nonexperimental ones. The researcher or manager can systematically structure the desired work environment and minimize irrelevant or contaminating influences. As a result, conclusions concerning causal relations between variables can be made with some degree of certainty. Where it is not possible to secure such high control, however&#x2014;perhaps because the organization does not wish to make a major structural change simply for purposes of an experiment&#x2014;a field study represents a compromise design. It allows for some degree of control but does not require changing the organization.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm344886416"><strong data-effect="bold">External Validity.</strong> The question of external validity is crucial to any study. If the results of a study in one setting cannot be applied with confidence to other settings, the utility of the results for managers is limited. In this regard, survey research, field studies, and field experiments have higher levels of external validity than naturalistic observations or laboratory experiments. Naturalistic observations are typically based on nonrandom samples, and such samples often exhibit characteristics that may not allow for transfers of learning from one organization to another. A clear example can be seen in the case of a small company in which the president implemented a unique compensation plan that proved successful. It would be impossible to predict whether such a plan would work in a major corporation, because of the different nature of the organizations. Similarly, there is some question about how realistic a work environment is actually created in a laboratory situation. If managers are to learn from the lessons of other organizations, they should first learn the extent to which the findings from one kind of organization are applicable elsewhere.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm342397280"><strong data-effect="bold">Cost.</strong> As one would expect, the quality of information and its price covary. The more rigorous the design (and thus the more accurate the information), the higher the cost. Costs can be incurred in a variety of ways and include actual out-of-pocket expenses, time invested, and residue costs. The organization is left with the aftermath of an experiment, which could mean raised employee expectations and anxieties, as well as the possibility of disillusionment if the experiment fails. It should be noted that, in survey research, a large amount of general information can be gathered quickly and cheaply.</p>
          <p id="auto_c88fe761-e354-44d6-9ce1-0f1f33576955_fs-idm325198912"><strong data-effect="bold">Overall Level of Rigor.</strong> In summary, then, the real answer to the question concerning which strategy is best lies in the degrees of freedom a manager has in selecting the design. If an experiment is clearly out of the question (perhaps because one&#x2019;s superior doesn&#x2019;t want anything altered), a field study may be the best possible strategy, given the constraints. In fact, field studies are often considered a good compromise strategy in that they have a medium amount of rigor but are also fairly quick and inexpensive. On the other hand, if one simply wishes to take an attitude survey, survey research is clearly in order. If one is not allowed to do anything, authoritative opinions from others may be the only information available. However, if constraints are not severe, experimental methods are clearly superior in that they allow for greater certainty concerning major influences on the criterion variable and on the problem itself.</p>
