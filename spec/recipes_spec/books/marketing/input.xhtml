The book is designed for conceptual accessibility to students who are relatively early in their business curriculum (such as second-year students), yet it is also suitable for more advanced students. Due to the wide range of audiences and course approaches, the book is designed to be as flexible as possible. Its modular structure allows the introduction and review of content from prerequisite subjects in financial accounting, statistics, and economics, depending on student preparation. It provides a solid grounding in the core concepts of financial theory so that business students interested in a major or minor in finance will also be prepared for more rigorous upper-level courses. Concepts are further reinforced through applicable connections and practical calculation techniques for more detailed and realistic company scenarios from various industries.</p>

To illuminate the meaningful applications and implications of financial ideas, the book incorporates a unique use-case approach, providing connections among topics, solutions, and real-world problems. This multifaceted framework drives the integration of concepts while maintaining a modular chapter structure. Theoretical and practical aspects are presented in a balanced manner, and select ethical considerations are introduced, particularly in the context of corporate governance.</p>
    <p id="auto_fc53c22b-a1f9-445d-b4fe-9f80eb4643e8_para-00050">In order to create meaning for all students, <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Finance</em> exposes them to a range of companies, industries, and scenarios reflecting different contexts. Examples of large companies such as Apple, Peloton, and American Airlines are balanced with small businesses—coffee shops, clothing stores, and salons—that may be more aligned with student experiences. The text includes authentic narratives from corporate finance, small business, and personal finance to drive relevance and interest of the discipline. Profiles and interviews include diverse figures in finance, such as Carlos Slim, Irina Simmons, Janet Yellen, and Ben Bernanke. Problems and exercises have been carefully constructed to place students into a range of settings and contexts, as they develop knowledge and put it into practice. Finally, to reflect very recent experiences, the authors have incorporated several discussions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on people and businesses.</p>
    <p id="auto_fc53c22b-a1f9-445d-b4fe-9f80eb4643e8_para-00011">Throughout, there is an emphasis on data use in business decision-making, with integrative sections on the importance and analysis of financial, economic, and statistical data. Data types include <a href="https://openstax.org/r/fred-stlouisfed">FRED</a>® economic data, company financial statements, and stock prices. Practical techniques and calculation examples for data analysis with financial calculators (the Texas Instruments BA II Plus™ Professional model is used as the basis for example illustrations) and/or spreadsheets are included for relevant topics. For key chapters, downloadable Microsoft® Excel® data files are available for student reference. This technical feature provides students with access to the Excel data files used in the chapter examples for time value of money package to promote further interest in trends in data science.</p>

Part II discusses the analytical tools and frameworks to understand a broad range of customers (whether consumers or businesses) and categorize them into target markets. We will then review marketing research techniques used to gather data and make sound marketing decisions. Finally, the last two chapters of this section will emphasize the challenges of expanding to international markets and reaching culturally and demographically diverse segments in domestic markets.</p>

For example, the development of its mobile application, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_83df8914-c08a-4f25-bd1e-159e65a5cff3_term-00002">Mobile Order and Pay</span>, and self-order kiosks, transformed customer experiences in and around their restaurants, giving customers more ways to securely pay and personalize their orders to meet their needs. Digital sales exceeded $10 billion, or nearly 20% of systemwide sales in 2020 across the top six markets.</p>

      <p id="auto_83df8914-c08a-4f25-bd1e-159e65a5cff3_para-00004">Digital innovations also paid off for McDonald’s drive-thru channel. As indoor dining took a plunge during the pandemic, McDonald’s made significant drive-thru technology investments such as dynamic menu boards and dramatically cutting menu items to their “core menu”, enabling McDonald’s to cut 30 seconds from its drive-thru times on average and move 300 million additional cars through McDonald’s drive-thrus during the pandemic.</p>

      <p id="auto_83df8914-c08a-4f25-bd1e-159e65a5cff3_para-00005">Enabling delivery also became a significant focus for McDonald’s to provide customers with safe channels to order food. It scaled up its delivery platform and rapidly expanded the number of restaurants that offer delivery to 28,000 of 41,000 global restaurants. The result is that delivery sales more than tripled.</p>

      <p id="auto_83df8914-c08a-4f25-bd1e-159e65a5cff3_para-00006">By focusing innovation on the “three D’s”, McDonald’s was able to create a faster, easier and better customer experience, even in the face of tremendous change.</p>

Perhaps you stopped on the way to work or class to buy a soft drink or coffee, went to the grocery store on the way home to get bread or milk, or ordered something online. You likely make buying decisions nearly every day and probably don’t give most of those decisions much thought. But the way you make those decisions are significant for marketers, because if they can understand why, you buy what you buy and when you buy it, they can use that information to boost revenue.</p>

These stimuli go into your black box, which consists of two parts: buyer characteristics such as beliefs and attitudes, motives, perceptions and values, and the buyer decision-making process, which we’ll cover in a bit. The outcome of the thinking that takes place in that black box is your response. What will you buy, where, when, how often, and how much?</p>

It’s also determined by the level of involvement that you show toward a purchase and the amount of risk involved in the purchase. There are four types of consumer buying behavior, as shown in <a href="#auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_fig-00002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>:</p>

Because you likely don’t buy a new car frequently, you’re highly involved in the buying decision, and you probably do some research different vehicles or talk with friends of family before reaching your decision. By that time, you’re convinced that there’s a significant difference between cars, and you’ve developed your own unique set of criteria that helps you decide on your purchase.</p>

    <p id="auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_para-00008"><span data-type="term" id="auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_term-00005">Dissonance-reducing buying behavior</span> occurs when you’re highly involved in the purchase but see little difference among brands. Let’s say you’re replacing the flooring in your house with ceramic tile – another expensive, infrequent purchase. However, you might think that all brands in a certain price range are “about the same,” so you might shop around to see what’s available, but you’ll probably buy rather quickly, perhaps as a result of a good price or availability. However, after you’ve made your purchase, you may experience post-purchase dissonance (also known as buyer’s remorse) when you notice some disadvantages of the tile you purchased or hear good things about a brand you didn’t purchase.</p>

    <p id="auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_para-00009"><span data-type="term" id="auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_term-00006">Habitual buying behavior</span> has low involvement in the purchase decision because it’s often a repeat buy, and you don’t perceive much brand differentiation. Perhaps you usually buy a certain brand of organic milk, but you don’t have brand loyalty. If your regular brand isn’t available at the store or another brand is on sale, you’ll probably buy a different brand.</p>

You may not be unhappy with your last purchase of tortilla chips, but you simply want to try something new. It’s a matter of brand switching for the sake of variety rather than because of dissatisfaction.</p>

  <p id="auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_para-00015">There is no single correct way to write a marketing plan. The scope of the plan will depend on the stage of the lifecycle, the strategic importance of the offering to the organization, and standardized planning requirements of the organization. With a minor product release, or a slight change in focus, only a short update might be required. If we are planning a new product launch, for a product that will become a flagship offering, and significant investment in product development, marketing, and sales will be required, then the marketing plan may need to be substantial. Some organizations require a formal marketing plan or scope document for every product release - big or small. In general, the larger the financial and strategic risk, the more documentation that is usually required. Below is information on how best to prepare a marketing plan.</p>

      <div data-type="note" class="word-document" id="auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_note-00001">

    <p id="auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_para-00016">The executive summary can be the most important part of any formal marketing plan. It is certainly the most read section of most marketing plans. The executive summary should be no more than one page in length. It should contain a concise summary of the information provided in the plan, along with a summary of significant conclusions and next steps.</p>

    <p id="auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_para-00017">The goal of the executive summary is to allow the reader to quickly skim the text and understand the important elements and conclusions contained in the plan. If the reader requires more detail, then they can turn to the appropriate section in the plan and examine the supporting analysis and information. Since the executive summary condenses all the information in the plan, it is usually written after the rest of the plan has been completed.</p>

    <p id="auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_para-00018">If the marketing plan is for the overall organization, then the mission statement should capture the vision, mission, and values of the overall organization. If the marketing department has created an extension of the organization-level elements for the marketing function, that can be included in this section as well. If this section is included, then it will be important to show how the marketing plan supports the vision, mission, and values of the organization.</p>

    <p id="auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_para-00019">If this is a marketing plan for a marketing offering (product), rather than the overall marketing organization, then we will probably want to lead with a Situation (Opportunity) Analysis instead. This section will highlight the market need (problem solved), the size of the opportunity, and explain how the organization is uniquely qualified (positioned) to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

  <p id="auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_para-00020">SWOT analysis was covered in detail earlier in this chapter. SWOT is a very flexible tool that can be used at the corporate, business, function, or even product level. If the marketing plan is for the organization overall, then we can use the business-level SWOT analysis and highlight that factors that are associated with marketing. If the marketing plan is for a new market (product) offering, then it may be more appropriate to work through the process of creating a SWOT for the specific offering. We should be able to leverage the pre-existing business-level external and internal analysis. This information will then need to be augmented to reflect the market forces and competitors in the market segment addressed.</p>

    <p id="auto_279a26a4-6202-43e9-ac3c-d5eeb5b0addf_para-00021">This section captures the goals and objectives for the marketing team or the new market offering – depending on the scope of the plan. This is where SMART goals can come into play. The plan should include any corporate goals and objectives that they are supporting. The plan should also include any more focused goals and objectives for the marketing organization or the market offering proposed.</p>

Why did you buy that specific make and model? Was it because its sleek style made you feel good about yourself? Perhaps you bought a Ford pickup because your father has always bought Fords. These are just a few examples of some of the factors that influence consumer buying behavior. Let’s examine some others.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00003">Cultural factors comprise a set of values or ideologies of a particular community or group of individuals.

Human behavior is largely learned. When you were a child, you learned basic values, perceptions, wants and behaviors from your family, and other external factors like the schools and churches you attended. Consider how these values and attitudes have shaped your buying behavior. For example, a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00002">Hindu</span> bride wears a red lehenga to her wedding, whereas <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00003">Christian</span> brides typically wear white. In India, widows are expected to wear white, whereas widows in the U.S. and other parts of the world generally wear more somber colors to a funeral.<a href="#auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-001" data-type="cite" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-001-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_note-00001"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00005">A <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00004">subculture</span> is a group of people who share a set of secondary values, such as environmentalists, LGBTQ, or bodybuilders. Ethnic and racial groups share the language, food and culture of their heritage. Other subcultures are united by shared experiences, like the biker culture, which revolves around a dedication to motorcycles. The Amish subculture is known for its conservative beliefs and reluctance to adapt to modern technology. Think about what subculture(s) you may belong to, and how that subculture influences your buying behavior. For example, are you a “sneakerhead”—someone who collects sneakers? Collectors range from casual sneaker fans to those who buy and sell shoes like sports cards. True fanatics will even camp out overnight for the latest pair. Sneakerheads are mainstream enough that songs reference the idea. For example, in the third verse of “Shadrach,” the Beastie Boys sing, “More Adidas sneakers than a plumber’s got pliers.” If interested, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6nrmFdlXc0">this video of the “Shadrach” song</a>.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00006">Your <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00005">social class</span> is also an important influence in your buying behavior. When sociologists talk of social class, they refer to those who occupy a similar socioeconomic status. While there is disagreement on both the number of social classes in the U.S., many sociologists suggest 5 social classes: upper class, upper middle class, lower middle class, working class and the poor. These social classes are largely defined by disposable income, but its influence goes deeper than just dollars or euros. For example, a lower middle-class individual might focus primarily on price when considering a product, whereas an upper middle-class person might consider product quality and features before price. However, you can be influenced by a social class to which you don’t belong but want to be accepted. Have you ever spent money you really didn’t have on brand name running shoes or a designer purse because that’s what your friends have?</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00007">Finally, your <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00006">gender</span> plays an important role in your buying behavior. Men and women not only want different products as a result of their upbringing and socialization, but men and women approach shopping itself with different motives, perspectives and considerations. Men tend to follow a utilitarian, more logic-based approach when shopping. They want a quick, effortless shopping experience. Women, on the other hand, make decisions on a more emotional level. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00007">Zappos.com</span> considers these different motives and provides different layouts on their landing pages for men and women.

It is important to deduct COGS from profitability to understand how much direct costs impact profitability fully. However, expenses don’t end once manufacturing costs are considered. Companies pay for overhead, such as office space, trucks, and warehouses. They also account for depreciation on their assets, pay taxes, and incur costs for employees. All of these expenses chip away at profitability. Profit margin calculates profitability after expenses.</p>

      <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00045">There are two types of profit margin on an income statement: gross profit and net profit.</p>

      <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00046"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00041">Gross profit margin</span> compares profit before expenses to total revenue. We call profit before expenses net sales. The formula for gross profit margin is [GPM = (net sales - COGS)/(net sales x 100)]. The calculation is expressed as a percentage.</p>

      <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00047"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00042">Net profit margin</span> takes the calculation one step further. It deducts all expenses from profitability, including administrative, sales, amortization, debt payments, taxes, income, and depreciation of assets. This provides a more accurate look at profitability because it considers all the costs associated with producing and selling the product or service. The formula for net profit margin is [NPM = (revenue - COGS - other taxes and expenses)/(revenue x 100)]. The calculation is expressed as a percentage.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00009">Social factors are those factors that are prevalent in the society where the consumer lives. Every society is composed of several individuals who have different preferences and behaviors, and these influence the personal preferences of others in the society. The bottom line is that we as humans are social individuals, and the influences of our family, reference groups, and roles and status (refer to <a href="#auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_fig-00002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) have a huge impact on our buying behavior.</p>

    </figure>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00010">Let’s first consider the influence of <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00008">family</span>. It is generally believed that most of us pass through two families: the family of orientation (i.e., the family to which you were born or with whom you grew up) and the family of procreation (the family formed through marriage, including your spouse and/or children.) Consider first the family of orientation. When you were growing up, whether or not you recognized it, you developed some degree of buying behavior through watching your parents and probably tend to buy the same products or services as you grew older. Was your father a die-hard <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00009">Chevy</span> man? If so, the chances that you’ll probably at least consider buying a Chevy when it’s time to buy another car. Now consider the influence that your spouse and/or children have on your buying behavior. You may want that Chevy pickup because that’s what your father drove, but your spouse may subtly (or perhaps not so subtly) sway you towards a Chevy crossover SUV because it’s more practical with kids to transport to school, sports and other activities.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00011"><span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00010">Reference groups</span> are those groups with which you like to be associated. These can be formal groups, such as being a member of a country club, church or professional group, or informal groups of friends or acquaintances. These groups serve as our role models and inspiration and influence what types of products we will buy and which brands we choose. Reference groups are characterized by having opinion leaders – people who influence others. These opinion leaders aren’t necessarily higher-income or better educated, but others view them as having more expertise in a particular area. For example, a teenage girl may look to the opinion leader in her reference group of friends for fashion guidance, or a college student might aspire to getting an advanced degree from the same university as an admired professor. Social media influencers also play a role here. Consider the influence that celebrities like Kendall Jenner (with more than 196 million Instagram followers) or Leo Messi (with over 277 million Instagram followers) have on young women and those who aspire to be professional footballers.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00012">All of us assume different <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00011">roles</span> and <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00012">status</span> depending upon the groups, clubs, family, or organizations to which we belong. For example, a working mother who is taking classes at the local community college assumes 3 roles at varying times – that of an employee, a mother, and a student. Her buying decisions will be influenced by each of these roles at different times. When she is shopping for clothing, her purchases may be influenced by any or all of these roles – professional attire for the office, casual clothes for classes, or yoga pants for home.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00014">Age is a major factor that influences buying behavior because consumer needs and wants change with age. Your buying habits as a teenager or a 20-something year-old are vastly different than the buying habits of middle-age or elderly people. Consider the four generational cohorts currently comprising the consumer market:</p><ul id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_list-00002">

This generational cohort is approximately 74 million people strong in the U.S. and accounts for $2.6 trillion in buying power, so you can imagine their impact on the consumer market. What types of products would you expect Baby Boomers to buy? Key categories for this group of buyers include pharmacy and healthcare products, household goods and appliances, wine, books (digital and physical), cosmetics and skin care products.<a href="#auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-003" data-type="cite" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-003-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_note-00005"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></li>

This cohort is approximately 65 million strong and has more spending power than other generations because they’re at or reaching the peak of their careers, and many Gen Xers are dual-income families. This makes them an optimal target for higher-end brands and convenience-related goods, like made-to-order or prepared meals from the grocery store.</li>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00015">Likewise, your <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00019">life-cycle stage</span> has a major influence on your buying habits. Consider the different buying choices you make as a single person who is renting an apartment in an urban area versus the choices you would make as a homeowner in the suburbs with children. It should be noted, though, that age and life-cycle stage can often be poor predictors of buying behavior. For example, some 40 year-olds are just starting their families, while others are sending their kids off the college. Still other 40 year-olds are single (or single again). Some 70 year-olds may fit the stereotype of a retired person with a fixed income; others are still active with plenty of disposable income.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00016">Your <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00020">economic situation</span> (income) is a huge influence in your buying behavior. Higher income typically means higher disposable income, and that disposable income gives consumers more opportunity to spend on high-end products. Conversely, lower-income and middle-income consumers spend most of their income on basic needs such as groceries and clothing.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00017">Your <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00021">occupation</span> is also a significant factor in your buying behavior, because you tend to purchase things that are appropriate to your profession For instance, a blue-collar worker is less likely to buy professional attire like business suits, whereas attorneys and white collar workers may favor suits or business casual workwear. There are even companies that specialize in workwear for certain types of workers, such as healthcare professionals who buy scrubs or construction workers who buy steel-toed boots.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00018">What do you consider to be your <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00022">lifestyle</span>? Your lifestyle reflects your attitudes and values. Do you strive to live an active, healthy lifestyle? If so, your purchasing decisions may focus on healthier food alternatives instead of fast food. Do you consider yourself to be a soccer mom? You may (perhaps reluctantly) forego that sports car for a minivan in order to transport your kids to youth sporting events or other activities.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00019">Your personality and self-concept are also important factors influencing your buying behavior. <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00023">Personality</span> is the characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviors that make a person unique. It’s believed that personality arises from within the individual and remains fairly consistent throughout life.<a href="#auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-006" data-type="cite" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-006-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_note-00008"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Some examples of the many personality traits people have might include things like self-confidence, individualism, extroversion, introversion, aggressive or competitiveness. The bottom line is that your personality greatly influences what you buy as well as when and how you use or consume products and services. Perhaps even more importantly, as consumers, we tend to buy not only products we need but also those products or services that we perceive as being consistent with our “self-concept.” In other words, we generally want our products to match or blend in with who we think we are.<a href="#auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-007" data-type="cite" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-007-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_note-00009"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

It’s the driving force behind your actions. One of the most widely known motivation theories is <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00025">Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</span> (see <a href="#auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_fig-00005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00022"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00026">Victor Maslow</span> argued that all individuals have 5 needs, arranged from the most basic lower-level deficiency needs to the highest-level growth needs. As shown above, physiological needs are the most basic and include things like adequate food, water and shelter. The second level is safety and security, the need to be safe from physical and psychological harm. The third level is belongingness or social needs and would include the need for emotional attachments, friendship, love or belonging to community or church groups. Esteem, the fourth level, includes such needs as recognition from others, taking pride in your education or work, awards and/or prestige. The highest level is self-actualization, which involves self-development and seeking challenges.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00023">Maslow asserted that we strive to satisfy our most basic needs before directing behavior toward satisfying higher-level needs, so it stands to reason that consumer buying behavior would follow this model. For example, you’d first have to have your needs fulfilled for food and shelter before you might consider purchasing insurance or putting money away for retirement.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00024"><span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00027">Perception</span> is the way in which we identify, organize and interpret sensory information. It’s another variable in consumer buying behavior because the perceptions you have about a business or its products or services have a dramatic effect on your buying behavior. What makes perception even more complex is that consumers can form different perceptions of the same stimulus because of three perceptual processes: selective attention, selective distortion, and selective retention. Let’s take a closer look.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00025">Every day, we’re bombarded with marketing messages from TV commercials, magazine and newspaper ads, billboards, and social media ads. It’s estimated that the average person encounters between 6,000 to 10,000 ads every single day. It stands to reason that you can’t possibly pay attention to all of the competing stimuli surrounding you, so you’ll pay attention to only those stimuli that you consider relevant to your wants and needs and screen out the rest. That’s the process known as <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00028">selective attention</span>.<a href="#auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-008" data-type="cite" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-008-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_note-00010"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00026">Even the stimuli that we notice don’t always come across in the way in which the senders intended. <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00029">Selective distortion</span> is the tendency of people to interpret information in a way that fits their preconceived notions. This was demonstrated years ago when <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00030">Pepsi</span> launched its <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00031">Pepsi Challenge</span> blind taste test commercials. Participants were presented with 2 colas in unmarked plastic cups, asked to taste both colas, and choose the one they liked better. Then the tester would lift a small screen to reveal the brand the participants preferred. In TV commercials that aired for years, Pepsi showed the stunned reactions of loyal <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00032">Coke</span> drinkers who had chosen Pepsi over Coke in the test. One grandmother in a commercial said, “I can’t believe it. I’ve never had a Pepsi in my life, but it must be better!”<a href="#auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-009" data-type="cite" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-009-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_note-00011"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00027">We also tend to forget much of what we learn and retain information that supports our preconceived attitudes and beliefs. That’s the power of <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00033">selective retention</span>, a bias where you’re more likely to remember messages that are closely related to your interests, values and beliefs, rather than those that are contrary to those values and beliefs.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00028">Beliefs, feelings and attitudes also play an important role in consumer buying behavior. <span data-type="term" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00034">Beliefs</span> are consumer perceptions of how a product or brand performs on different attributes. These beliefs are generally formed through personal experience, advertising, and conversations with others, and these beliefs play a vital role because they can be either positive or negative. You can even hold both positive and negative beliefs about the same object. For example, you may believe that coffee is good for you because it helps you focus and stay alert, but you may also worry about the effect of coffee on your health and the way it stains your teeth. The fact is that human beliefs aren’t always accurate and can change according to the situation.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00030">We’ve already talked about beliefs, so let’s focus for a moment on affect or feeling. We as consumers hold certain feelings toward brands, products or services. Sometimes these feelings are based on our beliefs, such as a vegetarian who can’t stand the thought of eating a hamburger, but you may also have feelings which are relatively independent of your beliefs. For example, an environmentalist may object to clearing forests to make way for a housing development but may have positive affect toward Christmas trees because they subconsciously associate these trees with the experience that they had at Christmas as a child.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00031">The behavioral intention aspect of an attitude is what you as a consumer plan to do – i.e., buy the brand or not buy the brand. As with affect, this is sometimes a logical consequence of your beliefs but may sometimes reflect other circumstances. Consider a consumer who doesn’t particularly like a restaurant but will go there because it’s an after-class gathering spot with her friends.<a href="#auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-010" data-type="cite" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-010-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_note-00012"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

The fact is that much consumer behavior is learned, and much of what you buy is based on your previous experiences with the brand. It’s commonly known as the Law of Effect, which asserts that, if an action is followed by a pleasant consequence, you’re likely to repeat it; if the action is followed by an unpleasant consequence, you’re less likely to repeat it. For example, let’s say you buy an <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_term-00037">Apple iPhone</span>.

On the other hand, if you’ve had a not-so-positive experience with your iPhone, you’re likely to look at other brands when considering purchasing other devices.</p>

For example, in a grocery store lighting study, researchers lit half of a supermarket with LED lighting and the other half with traditional fluorescent lighting. Over a 21-week period, the LED-lit side of the store sold 2% more products per customer.<a href="#auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-011" data-type="cite" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-011-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_note-00013"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00035">Spatial factors also play a role. The way a product is displayed may make it seem desirable, but a crowded store or a long line at the cash register can suddenly make that same product seem less desirable.</p>

        <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00040">As consumers, we usually don’t think twice about what a store smells or sounds like or the way it makes us feel, think or do. But Abercrombie &amp; Fitch thinks about it a lot.</p>
        <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00041">The company has its own line of men’s fragrances called “Fierce,” which is sprayed liberally in stores to give off what the company describes as a “lifestyle…packed with confidence and a bold, masculine attitude.” A&amp;F knows who it wants in its stores and by associating its fragrance with its stores it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy for its male clientele who, by wanting to smell like A&amp;F, will be like the models and sales staff in the store.</p>
        <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00042">A&amp;F also plays loud club music throughout its stores, attracting young people who can withstand loud music longer, while older customers may run from it. It’s just another way that A&amp;F is enabling its stores to maintain a more youthful clientele and a “fresher” image.<a href="#auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-012" data-type="cite" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_rf-012-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_note-00014"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00036">The social situation of shopping is another situational factor. Did you know that you’re more likely to stop to look at certain products when you’re in the company of a friend as opposed to a parent? The social aspect can even alter the price you’re willing to pay. You might be more inclined to purchase a more expensive product when you’re with a colleague or potential partner than you would if you’re with a friend or spouse.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00037">The goal of your shopping trip is yet another situational factor. If you go to a store to look for a birthday present for your mother, your purpose is totally different than if you’re casually shopping for a new pair of shoes. The reason for shopping dictates the kinds of products customers are willing to interact with at that time and may cause them to bypass certain products they would normally interact with on another shopping trip.14 This is even true at the grocery store. You’ll interact with products differently if you’re on your weekly shopping trip versus simply going into the store because you’re out of milk.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00038">Much like the purpose of your shopping trip, timing also influences your consumer behavior. If you’re in a rush because it’s Christmas Eve and you haven’t bought a present for your best friend yet, you’ll interact with fewer products than if you have hours to shop. Even if 2 people are looking for the same type of product, the one in a rush will probably end up with the most accessible product, whereas the leisurely consumer has time to weigh price and quality of the offerings.</p>

  <p id="auto_78588040-4b9c-403a-83e8-f86a72fda1a4_para-00039">Finally, your mood influences your buying behavior. Someone feeling sad or stressed interacts differently with products than a happy, relaxed shopper. The same can be said for someone who’s fatigued versus someone who’s full of energy.</p>

    </section>



    <section data-depth="1" id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_sect-00002"><h3 data-type="title">Stage 1: Need Recognition</h3>
      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00004">The buying process actually starts when you sense a difference between your actual state and your desired state. This is referred to as problem recognition or need recognition. You might become aware of the need through internal stimuli (such as feeling hungry or thirsty when you’re on a long road trip) or external stimuli (such as passing a bakery and smelling the wonderful aroma of cookies baking).</p>

      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00005">Sometimes recognizing the problem or need is easy. You’ve run out of toilet paper or milk. But other times recognizing the problem or issue is more complicated. For example, think about this first stage in terms of your decision to enroll in college. What was the stimulus that triggered your interest in attending college? Are you a working adult who has recognized that upward advancement in your company won’t happen without possessing a college degree? Have you long had an aspiration to be an entrepreneur, and you wanted to get some business courses under your belt so that you’re better prepared for the challenges of entrepreneurship? Perhaps a career in marketing has been on your internal radar since high school, and you’ve decided to take the plunge and get your degree in marketing. Or perhaps, after graduating from high school, your parents gave you an ultimatum – find a job or enroll in college.</p>

    <section data-depth="1" id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_sect-00003"><h3 data-type="title">Stage 2: Information Search</h3>
      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00006">Now that you’ve identified the problem or need, you’ll be inclined to search for more information. There are actually 2 different search states. The milder search state is called “heightened attention,” in which you become more receptive to information about the product or service. The stronger search state is called “active information search,” in which you might do some research about the product or service on the Internet (referred to as an internal search), ask friends and/or family members their opinions (what’s known as an external search), or even visit stores to view and touch the product (called an experiential search).</p>

      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00007">Keep in mind, of course, that not all needs/problems identified in Stage 1 will require this second stage. If you’ve run out of bread or toilet paper, you’re probably not going to do an information search; rather, you’ll just go to the store to buy what you need, and your information search may be as simple as checking prices at the grocery store to see if your favorite brand is available or another brand is on sale. However, purchase decisions of more consequence will usually trigger an information search of some type.</p>

      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00008">Again, consider the process you went through in deciding which college to attend. What sources of information did you use to find out about the colleges or universities you considered attending? Did you look at their websites, talk with friends or family who attended that school, or perhaps even visit the campus?</p>

      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00009">Consumers are said to view a product or service as a “bundle of product attributes,” and you’ll evaluate several attributes of the product or service in reaching your purchase decision. For example, if you’re buying a camera, you’ll consider factors such as number of pixels, image sharpness or price. If you’re buying mouthwash, you’ll consider factors such as flavor, effectiveness, and its germ-killing ability. If you’re booking a hotel, you’ll probably consider its location, cleanliness, whether it has a free breakfast in the morning or a pool, and of course price.</p>

      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00010">What bundle of attributes did you use when evaluating your college alternatives? You probably considered factors such as location, size of the campus, whether or not the school had the program of study you wanted, if it had online learning, and cost.</p>

      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00011">This stage involves actually reaching a decision on the purchase of the product or service. One way we navigate all the information, decisions and choices we have in our purchase decision is to use <span data-type="term" id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_term-00002">heuristics</span> – mental shortcuts or “rules of thumb.” Heuristics are types of pre-existing value judgments that are used when we make our purchase decisions.</p>

      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00012">For example, do you believe that the more expensive product is always of higher quality than the lower-priced product? That’s known as the price = quality heuristic. Brand loyalty is another heuristic we use in reaching our purchase decisions. For example, do you eat cereal? Do you always buy the same brand, or do you buy whatever’s on sale or a brand for which you have a coupon? Country of origin is still another heuristic. Given a choice, do you prefer to buy products made in the U.S. versus other countries?</p>

      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00013">How did you make your purchase decision to enroll in your college or university? What heuristics did you use?</p>

      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00014">After purchasing the product or service, you’ll now experience either satisfaction or dissatisfaction. You may have second thoughts after making the purchase decision, and these doubts lead to <span data-type="term" id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_term-00003">cognitive dissonance</span> – tension caused by uncertainty about the correctness of your decision. This may lead you to search for additional information to confirm the wisdom of your decision in order to reduce that tension.</p>

      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00015">What determines if a consumer if very satisfied, somewhat satisfied or dissatisfied with his or her purchase? Satisfaction is a function of the closeness between the buyer’s expectations and the product’s perceived performance. If the product’s performance falls short of expectations, you’ll be dissatisfied. If the product’s performance meets your expectations, you’ll be satisfied, and if the product’s performance exceeds your expectations, you’ll be very satisfied.</p>

      <p id="auto_1a35061c-1471-4bf9-8a89-ef0d554bc713_para-00016">Think about the purchase decision you made when you decided to enroll in your college or university. Are you very satisfied, satisfied or dissatisfied with your decision?</p>

      <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00002">All purchase behavior is in some sense ethical, involving moral judgment. For example, a consumer is concerned about the abuse of human rights in a foreign country, and corporate involvement in that country may then become a factor in the consumer’s purchasing decisions. Similarly, consumers concerned about animal rights may consider whether a cosmetic product has been tested on animals. For example, in one survey, 32% of consumers reported that they would likely stop purchasing their favorite brand if the manufacturer tested on animals.<a href="#auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_rf-001" data-type="cite" id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_rf-001-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_note-00001"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

        <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00003">Economic theory suggests that we as consumers seek to maximize utility (the total satisfaction received from consuming a product or service) at the lowest cost possible, and it follows that firms who have higher costs of production will be driven out of the market. Recently, more and more firms have started using “ethical” labels as a means of product differentiation, a marketing strategy in which your brand identifies the one thing that makes it genuinely different from competitors and then leverages that notion in its branding and messaging.<a href="#auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_rf-002" data-type="cite" id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_rf-002-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_note-00002"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> But what does this look like in action?

Chipotle sources local and sustainably-raised ingredients, dedicating itself to a company-wide goal of working with family farmers within a 130-mile radius of each location. Additionally, the brand has publicly committed to using non-GMO and ethically-raised ingredients, and that’s a clever PR move amidst a huge cultural shift of wanting better-made food in the U.S. It’s also a great way to stand out from the competition.<a href="#auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_rf-003" data-type="cite" id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_rf-003-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_note-00003"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

One way to find out is to ask someone who currently does this job. Using LinkedIn, conduct a search for data analysts in your geographic area and invite one or more to Connect with you through the LinkedIn platform. Once connected, send a message to each one telling them who you are and that you’re a marketing student, and ask if you can have a 15-minute phone conversation with them to ask them about their job. Come prepared to the phone conversation with a list of questions you want to ask. Be prepared to go off script and ask questions that come to mind on the spot. You can learn a lot about various marketing careers and making great contacts by simply asking the right questions! What questions do you want to ask? You might consider some of the following:</p><ul id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_list-00003">

Because many large companies have diverse product lines, make sure to select one (1) product line that will be the focus of your marketing plan. For example, Procter &amp; Gamble has many product lines, from Olay skin care to Pampers diapers, Tide laundry detergent, Pantene hair care, Metamucil, Ivory soap, etc. If you were to select Procter &amp; Gamble for your marketing plan, you would select ONE of the products, not the company as a whole.</p>

        <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00019">Early in life, the love for coffee blossomed. Through high school and college, Lisa worked in an upscale retail boutique. On the mornings Lisa opened the store, she grew to love the deep, rich smell of the coffee that would permeate the air from the local gourmet food store across from the boutique where she worked. Her love for coffee only deepened as she experienced local cafes throughout her travels while in college. In the back of her mind, she glamorized opening her own café.</p>

        <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00020">Throughout her early thirties, Lisa looked at locations, talked with coffee entrepreneurs, developed business feasibility studies and dreamed of one day having her own place. One big problem was finding the right geographical area where a small, independent coffee shop would be successful.</p>

        <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00021">After moving for the fifth time, Lisa realized the new, growing community where she now lived with her two small children lacked one important thing – good coffee. The town was rapidly expanding and was the fastest growing community in the state of Tennessee. This might be the time and place to revisit the idea of a coffee shop.</p>

        <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00022">Every feasibility study Lisa had done pointed to the need for strong community support. This new town had two important ingredients – college students and a burgeoning population. The area was abundant with many different church denominations, a few small, local colleges, and some new international businesses that had recently relocated to the community.</p>

        <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00023">With no coffee shop in the town, Lisa believed her concept could be successful. Currently, if you wanted a coffee, the nearest place to grab a cup was a Starbucks, which was over twenty minutes away. Starbucks made coffee mainstream, but it seemed that sitting down to enjoy a cup of coffee was becoming a thing of the past. As more and more people began grabbing their coffee from the drive-thru, could a community coffee bar with a wide variety of seating options and complimentary Wi-Fi be successful?</p>

        <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00024">Going forward with the idea, Lisa began to develop Wired Coffee Bar. Prior to opening, Lisa went to every local community event and provided free coffee for people to sample. Once the community had a taste of the coffee and an expectation for the opening, there was an eager clientele waiting in line on the first day of business. One customer even hugged Lisa to thank her for bringing coffee to the community.</p>

        <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00025">The concept took off and soon Lisa was the purveyor of fine coffee. Wired Coffee Bar was widely supported by the community. The local churches loved to meet for a coffee drink and connect with friends and neighbors. Throughout the day, business was conducted at the tables over a coffee and into the evening hours college students gathered to study and talk with friends.</p>

        <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00026">If you looked at the clientele throughout the day you could see the “grab and go” customers who came every morning to get their mochas, lattes, and cappuccinos. Into the late morning hours, the tables filled up with business meetings – builders and their new clients, PTA groups, pharmaceutical sales reps strategizing for the day and grabbing coffee for customers, and moms meeting for coffee before picking up kids at school. As the afternoon wore on, the seats would fill up with high school students meeting with tutors and friends to complete homework. The later evening hours had every seat filled with college students doing class projects or just “hanging” out with friends.</p>

        <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00027">Wired Coffee Bar had a focused niche of coffee and community. The menu wasn’t complex. It featured just coffee – hot, iced, frozen. Wired also offered a variety of teas that could be served hot or iced. Along with the drink options customers could choose from a selection of sweet or savory locally baked muffins, scones, quiche, cookies, and coffee cakes. But Wired was not a restaurant they were a true coffee bar.</p>

        <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00028">With a regular and steady customer base, Wired could see the busier times happening when school was in session and then summers saw a lighter revenue stream as the college students left and the local families took summer vacations out of town. The coffee business definitely needed the local support to offset the vacation schedules of the college students.</p>

        <p id="auto_79923e21-f896-46a8-aea8-a1af191a29fb_para-00029">Just as Wired Coffee Bar was hitting its stride, new coffee shops started to enter the once dormant community. Each new coffee location offered a drive-thru, something Wired Coffee Bar never wants to be – fast food coffee. As Lisa looked at ways to create more business, provide good coffee, and differentiate from the masses, she wondered if her concept could survive the hustle and the need for quicker service and a less laid-back atmosphere.</p>
