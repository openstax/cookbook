  <p id="auto_2f9bf212-8547-462b-a1eb-6cb9ace5d10a_para-00003">McDonald’s had a strong position in terms of digital innovation even before the pandemic. It had installed self-order kiosks in its restaurants beginning in 2015 and launched its mobile app (Mobile Order &amp; Pay) in 2017, allowing customers to browse the menu, find nearby restaurants, place their orders, and pay within the app. Digital sales exceeded $10 billion in 2020, nearly 20 percent of system-wide sales.</p>

  <p id="auto_2f9bf212-8547-462b-a1eb-6cb9ace5d10a_para-00004">The company also tackled the efficiency of its drive-through lanes by investing in dynamic menu boards and cutting its menu items to its “core menu.” As a result, McDonald’s was able to shave 30 seconds from its drive-through time. That time savings enabled the company to serve 300 million additional drive-through customers.</p>

  <p id="auto_2f9bf212-8547-462b-a1eb-6cb9ace5d10a_para-00005">The pandemic and the subsequent restrictions on indoor dining also led McDonald’s to scale up its delivery platform and the number of restaurants that offer delivery. By ramping up the number of restaurants that offer delivery from 28,000 to 41,000 total restaurants, delivery sales more than tripled.</p>

  <p id="auto_2f9bf212-8547-462b-a1eb-6cb9ace5d10a_para-00006">Focusing on the 3 Ds enabled McDonald’s to weather the pandemic and create a faster, easier, and improved customer experience.<a href="#auto_2f9bf212-8547-462b-a1eb-6cb9ace5d10a_rf-001" data-type="cite" id="auto_2f9bf212-8547-462b-a1eb-6cb9ace5d10a_rf-001-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_2f9bf212-8547-462b-a1eb-6cb9ace5d10a_note-00002"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

  <p id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_para-00002">How many buying decisions did you make today? Perhaps you stopped on the way to work or class to buy a soft drink or coffee, went to the grocery store on the way home to get bread or milk, or ordered something online. You likely make buying decisions nearly every day and probably don’t give most of those decisions much thought. But the way you make those decisions is significant for marketers, because if they can understand <em data-effect="italics">why</em> you buy what you buy and <em data-effect="italics">when</em> you buy it, they can use that information to boost revenue.</p>
  <p id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_para-00003"><span data-type="term" id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_term-00001">Consumer buying behavior</span> refers to the decisions and actions people undertake to buy products or services for personal use. In other words, it’s the actions you take before buying a product or service, and as you will see, many factors influence that behavior. You and all other consumers combine to make up the <span data-type="term" id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_term-00002">consumer market</span>.</p>

  <p id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_para-00004">It stands to reason that the hundreds of millions of people who make up the global consumer market don’t all buy the same products and services. Why do certain people prefer different items than others? The answer lies in the factors that influence consumer buying behavior. One model of consumer buying behavior is what’s known as the <span data-type="term" id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_term-00003">buyer’s black box</span>, which is named as such because little is known about what goes on in the human mind. It’s also known as the stimulus-response model.</p>
  <p id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_para-00005">As illustrated in the model shown in <a href="#auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_fig-00001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, consumer buying behavior is based on stimuli coming from a variety of sources—from marketers in terms of the <span data-type="term" id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_term-00004">4Ps (product, price, promotion, and place)</span>, as well as from environmental stimuli, such as economic factors, legal/political factors, and technological and cultural factors.</p>
  <p id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_para-00006">These stimuli go into your “black box,” which consists of two parts: buyer characteristics such as beliefs and attitudes, motives, perceptions, and values, and the buyer decision-making process, which is covered later in the chapter. Your response is the outcome of the thinking that takes place in that black box. What will you buy, where, when, how often, and how much?</p>

  <p id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_para-00007">Buying behavior is not influenced solely by the external environment. It’s also determined by your level of involvement in a purchase and the amount of risk involved in the purchase. There are four types of consumer buying behavior, as shown in <a href="#auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_fig-00002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

  <p id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_para-00008"><span data-type="term" id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_term-00005">Complex buying behavior</span> occurs when you make a significant or expensive purchase, like buying a new car. Because you likely don’t buy a new car frequently, you’re highly involved in the buying decision, and you probably research different vehicles or talk with friends or family before reaching your decision. By that time, you’re likely convinced that there’s a significant difference among cars, and you’ve developed your own unique set of criteria that helps you decide on your purchase.</p>
  <p id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_para-00009"><span data-type="term" id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_term-00006">Dissonance-reducing buying behavior</span> occurs when you’re highly involved in a purchase but see little difference among brands. Let’s say you’re replacing the flooring in your kitchen with ceramic tile—another expensive, infrequent purchase. You might think that all brands of ceramic tile in a certain price range are “about the same,” so you might shop around to see what’s available, but you’ll probably buy rather quickly, perhaps as a result of a good price or availability. However, after you’ve made your purchase, you may experience post-purchase dissonance (also known as buyer’s remorse) when you notice some disadvantages of the tile you purchased or hear good things about a brand you didn’t purchase.</p>
  <p id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_para-00010"><span data-type="term" id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_term-00007">Habitual buying behavior</span> has low involvement in the purchase decision because it’s often a repeat buy, and you don’t perceive much brand differentiation. Perhaps you usually buy a certain brand of organic milk, but you don’t have strong brand loyalty. If your regular brand isn’t available at the store or another brand is on sale, you’ll probably buy a different brand.</p>
  <p id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_para-00011"><span data-type="term" id="auto_26033155-e4b9-468c-89d2-1a510ad1c431_term-00008">Variety-seeking buying behavior</span> has the lowest customer involvement because brand switching is your norm. You may not be unhappy with your last purchase of tortilla chips, but you simply want to try something new. It’s a matter of brand switching for the sake of variety rather than because of dissatisfaction with your previous purchase.</p>

  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00002">Why people buy isn’t always a straightforward question. Think about the last time you bought a car, a bike, or other item. Why did you buy that specific make and model? Was it because its sleek style made you feel good about yourself? Perhaps you bought a particular brand because someone in your family bought the same brand. These are just a couple of examples of some of the factors that influence consumer buying behavior. Let’s examine some others.</p>
  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00003"><span data-type="term" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_term-00001">Cultural factors</span> comprise a set of values or ideologies of a particular community or group of individuals. These can include culture, subcultures, social class, and gender as outlined in <a href="#auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_fig-00001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

Human behavior is largely learned. When you were a child, you learned basic values, perceptions, wants, and behaviors from your family and other external influences like the schools and churches you attended. Consider how these values and attitudes have shaped your buying behavior. For example, in a traditional Hindu wedding in India, a bride may wear red lehenga to the wedding, whereas Christian brides typically wear white. In India, widows are expected to wear white, whereas widows in the United States and other parts of the world generally wear more somber colors to a funeral.<a href="#auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-002" data-type="cite" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-002-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_note-00001"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

Ethnic and racial groups share the language, food, and culture of their heritage. Other subcultures, like the biker culture, which revolves around a dedication to motorcycles, are united by shared experiences. The Amish subculture is known for its conservative beliefs and reluctance to adapt to modern technology. Think about what subculture(s) you may belong to and how they influence your buying behavior.

  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00009">Your <span data-type="term" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_term-00016">social class</span> is also an important influence on your buying behavior. Sociologists base definitions of social class on several different factors, including income, occupation, and education. While there is disagreement on the number of social classes defined by income in the United States, many sociologists suggest five social classes: upper class, upper-middle class, lower-middle class, working class, and the economically disadvantaged.<a href="#auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-003" data-type="cite" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-003-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_note-00003"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> Income is largely defined by disposable income (the money you have left to spend or save after taxes are deducted), but its influence goes beyond just dollars, euros, yen, etc. For example, a lower-middle-class individual might focus primarily on price when considering a product, whereas an upper-middle-class person might consider product quality and features before price. However, you also can be influenced by a social class to which you don’t belong but by which you want to be accepted. Have you ever spent money you really didn’t have on brand name running shoes or a designer purse because that’s what your friends have?</p>
  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00010">Finally, your <span data-type="term" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_term-00017">gender</span> plays an important role in your buying behavior. People of different genders not only want different products as a result of their upbringing and socialization, but they approach shopping itself with different motives, perspectives, and considerations. While it’s always dangerous to stereotype, those who identify as male typically follow a utilitarian, more logic-based approach when shopping. They want a quick, effortless shopping experience. Those who identify as female, on the other hand, make decisions on a more emotional level. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_term-00018"><strong class="colored-text">Zappos.com</strong></span> considers these different motives and provides different layouts on their landing pages for different genders. While the “male” version focuses on providing clear navigation by product categories, the “female” version aims to sell on emotion.<a href="#auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-004" data-type="cite" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-004-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_note-00004"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

It is generally believed that most people pass through two families: a family of orientation (i.e., the family to which you were born or with whom you grew up) and a family of procreation (the family formed through marriage or cohabitation, including your spouse, partner, and/or children). Consider first the family of orientation. When you were growing up, whether or not you recognized it, you likely developed some degree of buying behavior through watching adult members of your household and probably tend to buy the same products or services as you grow older. Was your father a die-hard <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_term-00022"><strong class="colored-text">Chevy</strong></span> driver? If so, the chances are good that you’ll probably at least consider buying a Chevy, too. Now consider the influence that your spouse, partner, and/or children have on your buying behavior. You may want that Chevy pickup because that’s what your father drove, but your spouse or partner may subtly (or perhaps not so subtly) sway you toward a Chevy crossover SUV because it’s more practical with kids to transport to school, sports, and other activities.</p>
  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00017"><span data-type="term" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_term-00023">Reference groups</span> are those groups with which you like to be associated. These can be formal groups, such as members of a country club, church, or professional group, or informal groups of friends or acquaintances. These groups serve as role models and inspirations, and they influence what types of products you buy and which brands you choose. Reference groups are characterized by having opinion leaders—people who influence others. These opinion leaders aren’t necessarily higher-income or better educated, but others view them as having more expertise in a particular area. For example, a teenage girl may look to the opinion leader in her reference group of friends for fashion guidance, or a college student might aspire to getting an advanced degree from the same university as an admired professor. Social media influencers also play a role here. Consider the influence that celebrities like Kendall <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_term-00066">Jenner</span> (with more than 217 million <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_term-00024"><strong class="colored-text">Instagram</strong></span> followers)<a href="#auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-005" data-type="cite" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-005-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_note-00007"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> or Leo <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_term-00067">Messi</span> (with over 310 million Instagram followers)<a href="#auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-006" data-type="cite" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-006-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_note-00008"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a> have on individuals.</p>

For example, a working mother who is taking classes at the local community college assumes three roles at varying times—that of an employee, a mother, and a student. Her buying decisions will be influenced by each of these roles at different times. When she is shopping for clothing, her purchases may be influenced by any or all of these roles—professional attire for the office, casual clothes for classes, or yoga pants for home.</p>

Consider the different buying choices you would make as a single person who is renting an apartment in an urban area versus the choices you would make as a homeowner in the suburbs with children. It should be noted, though, that age and life cycle stage can often be poor predictors of buying behavior. For example, some 40-year-olds are just starting their families, while others are sending their kids off to college. Still other 40-year-olds are single (or single again). Some 70-year-olds may fit the stereotype of a retired person with a fixed income; others are still active or perhaps still working, with plenty of disposable income.</p>

Higher income typically means higher disposable income, and that disposable income gives consumers more opportunity to spend on high-end products. Conversely, lower-income and middle-income consumers spend most of their income on basic needs such as groceries and clothing.</p>
  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00026">Your <span data-type="term" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_term-00035">occupation</span> is also a significant factor in your buying behavior because you tend to purchase things that are appropriate to your profession. For instance, a blue-collar worker is less likely to buy professional attire like business suits, whereas attorneys, accountants, and other white-collar workers may favor suits or business casual work clothes. There are even companies that specialize in work clothes for certain types of workers, such as health care professionals who buy scrubs or construction workers who buy steel-toed boots.</p>

What do you consider to be your lifestyle? Do you strive to live an active, healthy lifestyle? If so, your purchasing decisions may focus on healthier food alternatives instead of fast food. Do you consider yourself to be a soccer parent? You may (perhaps reluctantly) forgo that sports car for a minivan in order to transport your kids to youth sporting events or other activities.</p>

These beliefs are generally formed through personal experience, advertising, and conversations with others, and they play a vital role because they can be either positive or negative. You can even hold both positive and negative beliefs about the same thing. For example, you may believe that coffee is good for you because it helps you focus and stay alert, but you may also worry about the effect of coffee on your health and the way it stains your teeth.

Consumers often have certain feelings toward brands, products, or services. Sometimes these feelings are based on people’s beliefs, such as a vegetarian who can’t stand the thought of eating a hamburger, but you may also have feelings that are relatively independent of your beliefs. For example, someone who has strong environmentalist beliefs may object to clearing forests to make way for a housing development but may have positive feelings toward Christmas trees because they subconsciously associate these trees with the experience that they had at Christmas as a child.</p>
  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00059">The behavioral intention aspect of an attitude is what you as a consumer plan to do—buy the brand or not buy the brand. As with affect, this is sometimes a logical consequence of your beliefs but may sometimes reflect other circumstances. Consider a consumer who doesn’t particularly like a restaurant but will go there because it’s an after-class gathering spot with her friends.<a href="#auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-018" data-type="cite" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-018-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_note-00029"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

Learning, the process where customers acquire information they can apply to future purchases, is a foundational concept in marketing.

  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00062">Situational factors influencing consumers are external (refer to <a href="#auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_fig-00007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). These factors play an important role in how consumers experience a product and how these consumers’ opinions are formed.</p>

  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00063"><span data-type="term" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_term-00060">Environmental factors</span> such as music, lighting, ambient noise, and even smells can either discourage or encourage a consumer’s purchase decision. For example, researchers conducted a study on the effect of lighting on consumer purchases in a grocery store. They lit half the store with traditional fluorescent lighting and the other half of the building with LED lighting. Researchers conducted the study over 21 weeks and discovered that consumers bought 25 percent more products on the LED-lit side of the store.<a href="#auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-019" data-type="cite" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-019-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_note-00031"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00064">Spatial factors also play a role. The way a product is displayed may make it seem desirable, but a crowded store or a long line at the cash register can suddenly make that same product seem less desirable. Think about it: Have you ever seen a long line to check out at the cash register and put the product you intended to buy back on the shelf because it simply wasn’t worth it to waste your time standing in line?</p>

  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00066">As consumers, people usually don’t think twice about what a store smells or sounds like, the way it makes them feel or think, or what it makes them do. But <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_term-00061"><strong class="colored-text">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (A&amp;F)</strong></span> thinks about it a lot.</p>
  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00067">The company has its own line of men’s fragrances called “Fierce,” which is sprayed liberally in stores to give off what the company describes as a “lifestyle . . . packed with confidence and a bold, masculine attitude.” A&amp;F knows who it wants in its stores, and by associating its fragrance with its stores, it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy for its male clientele who, by wanting to smell like A&amp;F, will be like the models and sales staff in the store.</p>
  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00068">A&amp;F also plays loud club music throughout its stores, attracting young people who can withstand loud music longer, while older customers may run from it. It’s just another way that A&amp;F is enabling its stores to maintain a more youthful clientele and a “fresher” image.<a href="#auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-020" data-type="cite" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-020-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_note-00033"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00070">The social situation of shopping is another situational factor. Did you know that you’re more likely to stop to look at certain products when you’re in the company of a friend as opposed to a parent? The social aspect can even alter the price you’re willing to pay. You might be more inclined to purchase a more expensive product when you’re with a colleague or potential partner than you would if you’re with a friend or spouse.<a href="#auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-021" data-type="cite" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_rf-021-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_note-00034"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>
  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00071">The goal of your shopping trip is yet another situational factor. If you go to a store to look for a birthday present for your mother, your purpose is totally different than if you’re casually shopping for a new pair of shoes. The reason for shopping dictates the kinds of products customers are willing to interact with at that time and may cause them to bypass certain products they would normally interact with on another shopping trip. This is even true at the grocery store. You’ll interact with products differently if you’re on your weekly shopping trip versus simply going into the store because you’re out of milk.</p>
  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00072">Much like the purpose of your shopping trip, timing also influences your consumer behavior. If you’re in a rush because it’s Christmas Eve and you haven’t bought a present for your best friend yet, you’ll interact with fewer products than if you have hours to shop. Even if two people are looking for the same type of product, the one in a rush will probably end up with the most accessible product, whereas the leisurely consumer has time to weigh the price and quality of offerings.</p>
  <p id="auto_656a95e4-fd14-434b-af42-5f1cd2be1e67_para-00073">Finally, your mood influences your buying behavior. Someone who is feeling sad or stressed interacts differently with products than a happy, relaxed shopper. The same can be said for someone who’s fatigued versus someone who’s full of energy.</p>

  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00002">This chapter has examined many of the factors that influence consumer buying behavior, but behind the visible act of making a purchase lies an important decision process that takes place before, during, and after the purchase of a product or service. <a href="#auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_fig-00001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the five stages of the <span data-type="term" id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_term-00001">consumer decision process</span>.</p>

  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00003">A buyer passes through five stages of the consumer decision process when making choices about which products or services to buy. Let’s examine each, starting at the beginning.</p>

  <section data-depth="1" id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_sect-00002"><h3 data-type="title">Stage 1: Need Recognition</h3>
  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00004">The buying process starts when you sense a difference between your actual state and your desired state. This is referred to as problem awareness or need recognition. You might become aware of a need through internal stimuli (such as feeling hungry or thirsty when you’re on a long road trip) or external stimuli (such as passing a bakery and smelling the wonderful aroma of cookies baking).</p>
  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00005">Sometimes recognizing the problem or need is easy. You’ve run out of toilet paper or milk. But other times recognizing the problem or issue is more complicated. For example, think about this first stage in terms of your decision to enroll in college. What was the stimulus that triggered your interest in attending college? Are you a working adult who has recognized that upward advancement in your company won’t happen without possessing a college degree? Have you long aspired to be an entrepreneur, and you wanted to get some business and marketing courses under your belt so that you’re better prepared for the challenges of entrepreneurship? Perhaps a career in marketing has been on your internal radar since high school, and you’ve decided to take the plunge and get your degree in marketing. Or perhaps, after graduating from high school, your parents gave you an ultimatum—either find a job or enroll in college.</p>
  </section>

  <section data-depth="1" id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_sect-00003"><h3 data-type="title">Stage 2: Information Search</h3>
  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00006">Now that you’ve identified the problem or need, you’ll be inclined to search for more information. There are two different search states. The milder search state is called “heightened attention,” in which you become more receptive to information about the product or service. The stronger search state is called “active information search,” in which you might do some research about the product or service on the Internet (referred to as an internal search), ask friends and/or family members their opinions (what’s known as an external search), or even visit stores to view and touch the product (called an experiential search).</p>
  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00007">Keep in mind, of course, that not all needs/problems identified in Stage 1 will require this second stage. If you’ve run out of bread or toilet paper, you’re probably not going to do an information search; rather, you’ll just go to the store to buy what you need, and your information search may be as simple as checking prices at the grocery store to see if your favorite brand is available or another brand is on sale. However, purchase decisions of more consequence will usually trigger an information search of some type.</p>
  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00008">Again, consider the process you went through in deciding which college to attend. What sources of information did you use to find out about the colleges or universities you considered attending? Did you look at their websites, talk with friends or family who attended that school, or perhaps even visit the campus and meet with an admissions counselor?</p>

  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00009">Consumers are said to view a product or service as a “bundle of product attributes,” and you evaluate several attributes of a product or service in reaching your purchase decision. For example, if you’re buying a smartphone, you’ll consider factors such as battery life, speed, storage capacity, or price. If you’re booking a hotel, you’ll probably consider its location, cleanliness, free Wi-Fi, whether it has a free breakfast in the morning or a pool, and of course price.</p>
  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00010">What bundle of attributes did you use when evaluating your college alternatives? You may have considered factors such as location, size of the campus, whether the school had the program of study you wanted, if it had online learning, and cost.</p>

  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00011">This stage involves actually reaching a decision on the purchase of the product or service. One way people navigate all the information, evaluations, and choices in their purchase decision is to use <span data-type="term" id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_term-00002">heuristics</span>—mental shortcuts or “rules of thumb.” Heuristics are types of preexisting value judgments that people use to make decisions.</p>
  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00012">For example, do you believe that the more expensive product is always of higher quality than the lower-priced product? That’s known as the price = quality heuristic. Brand loyalty is another heuristic people use in reaching their purchase decisions. For example, do you eat cereal? Do you always buy the same brand, or do you buy whatever’s on sale or a brand for which you have a coupon? Country of origin is still another heuristic. Given a choice, do you prefer to buy products made in the United States versus products made in other countries?</p>
  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00013">How did you make your purchase decision to enroll in your college or university? What heuristics did you use?</p>

  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00014">After purchasing the product or service, you’ll experience either satisfaction or dissatisfaction. You may have second thoughts after making a purchase decision, and these doubts lead to <span data-type="term" id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_term-00003">cognitive dissonance</span>, or buyer’s remorse—tension caused by uncertainty about the correctness of your decision. This may lead you to search for additional information to confirm the wisdom of your decision in order to reduce that tension.</p>
  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00015">What determines if a consumer is very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, or dissatisfied with his or her purchase? Satisfaction is a function of the closeness between the buyer’s expectations and the product’s perceived performance. If the product’s performance falls short of expectations, you’ll be dissatisfied. If the product’s performance meets your expectations, you’ll be satisfied, and if the product’s performance exceeds your expectations, you’ll be very satisfied.</p>
  <p id="auto_bfb84abd-4471-4dbc-98ed-0b8ca1d8eae3_para-00016">Think about the purchase decision you made when you decided to enroll in your college or university. Are you very satisfied, satisfied, or dissatisfied with your decision?

  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00002">All purchase behavior is in some sense ethical, involving moral judgment. For example, a consumer is concerned about the abuse of human rights in a foreign country, so corporate involvement in that country may be a factor in the consumer’s purchasing decisions. Similarly, consumers concerned about animal rights may consider whether a cosmetic product has been tested on animals. For example, in one 2017 survey, 32 percent of US cosmetics consumers reported that they would “very likely” stop purchasing their favorite brand if the manufacturer tested on animals.<a href="#auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_rf-022" data-type="cite" id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_rf-022-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_note-00001"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00003">Economic theory suggests that consumers seek to maximize utility (the total satisfaction received from consuming a product or service) at the lowest cost possible, so it follows that firms that have higher costs of production will be driven out of the market. Recently, more and more firms have started using “ethical” labels as a means of <span data-type="term" id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_term-00008">product differentiation</span>, a marketing strategy in which a brand identifies the one thing that makes it genuinely different from competitors and then leverages that notion in its branding and messaging. But what does this look like in action? Let’s take a quick look at one popular brand that honed its differentiation strategy and succeeded as a result.</p>
  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00004">Like many fast-food chains, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_term-00001"><strong class="colored-text">Chipotle</strong></span> (see <a href="#auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_fig-00001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) focuses on the quality of its ingredients above all else. One of the brand’s hallmarks is that it works with family farmers within a 130-mile radius of each of its locations and attempts whenever possible to source local and sustainably raised ingredients. Additionally, Chipotle eliminated genetically modified (GMO) foods from its menu, citing public concerns about the safety of genetically modified ingredients.<a href="#auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_rf-023" data-type="cite" id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_rf-023-a"><div data-type="note" class="delete-me" display="inline" id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_note-00002"><!-- no-selfclose --></div></a></p>

Ethical consumerism has become something of a buzzword over the last decade, and organizations are taking notice of consumers’ expectations in terms of social and environmental practices. Consider some statistics to better understand how consumers put ethical consumerism in practice:</p>

  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00010">By choosing brands that align with their values, consumers are voting with their pocketbooks. Modern consumers are more than willing to take their business elsewhere if they perceive a disconnect between their values and those of the organization, and they will likely share their sentiments on social media.</p>

You can find marketers on both sides of the fence on this hotly debated topic. Some studies show that consumers are interested in products that align with their values.

  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00019">This chapter defined consumer markets and consumer buying behavior and discussed the buyer’s black box, the concept that attempts to mark the pattern consumers follow when making a purchase decision. It also categorized consumer buying behavior into four types: complex buying behavior, dissonance-reducing buying behavior, habitual buying behavior, and variety-seeking buying behavior.</p>
  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00020">This chapter also looked at the cultural, social, personal, psychological, and situational factors that influence consumer behavior and scrutinized the stages of the consumer decision process. Finally, it examined the role of ethics in consumer buying behavior and discussed ethical consumerism.</p>

The Careers in Marketing section earlier in this chapter lists numerous resources that you could try. Or you can try this <a href="https://openstax.org/r/humanmetrics">short personality assessment</a> that is similar to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. After you complete the assessment, your personality information will be revealed. You’ll learn if you’re extroverted or introverted, thinking or feeling, sensing or intuitive, and judging or perceiving. The results are shown as a four-letter acronym (for example, ENFP or ISTJ), and there are 16 possibilities that could arise.</p>

One way to find out is to ask someone who currently does this job. Using LinkedIn, conduct a search for data analysts in your geographic area and invite one or more to connect with you through the LinkedIn platform. Once connected, send a message to each one telling them who you are and that you’re a marketing student. Request a 15-minute phone conversation with them to ask them about their job. Come prepared to the phone conversation with a list of questions you want to ask. Be prepared to go off script and ask questions that come to mind on the spot. You can learn a lot about various marketing careers, and you can make great contacts by simply asking the right questions! What questions do you want to ask? You might consider some of the following:</p>

  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00033">During high school and college, Lisa worked in an upscale retail boutique. On the mornings Lisa opened the store, she grew to love the deep, rich smell of the coffee that would permeate the air from the local gourmet food store across from the boutique. Her love for coffee only deepened as she experienced local cafés throughout her travels while in college. In the back of her mind, she glamorized opening her own café.</p>
  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00034">Throughout her early thirties, Lisa looked at locations, talked with coffee entrepreneurs, developed business feasibility studies, and dreamed of one day having her own place. One big problem was finding the right geographical area where a small, independent coffee shop would be successful.</p>
  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00035">After moving for the fifth time, Lisa realized the new, growing community where she now lived with her two small children lacked one important thing—good coffee. The town was rapidly expanding and was the fastest-growing community in the state of Tennessee. This might be the time and place to revisit the idea of a coffee shop.</p>
  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00036">Every feasibility study Lisa completed pointed to the need for strong community support. This new town had two important ingredients—college students and a burgeoning population. The area was abundant with many different church denominations; a few small, local colleges; and some new international businesses that had recently relocated to the community.</p>
  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00037">With no coffee shop in the town, Lisa believed her concept could be successful. Currently, if you wanted a coffee, the nearest place to grab a cup was a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_term-00006"><strong class="colored-text">Starbucks</strong></span>, which was over 20 minutes away. Starbucks made specialty coffee mainstream, but it seemed that sitting down to enjoy a cup of coffee was becoming a thing of the past. As more and more people began grabbing their coffee from the drive-through, could a community coffee bar with a wide variety of seating options and complimentary Wi-Fi be successful?</p>
  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00038">Going forward with the idea, Lisa began to develop <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_term-00007"><strong class="colored-text">Wired Coffee Bar</strong></span>. Prior to opening, Lisa went to every local community event and provided free coffee for people to sample. Once the community had a taste of the coffee and an expectation for the opening, there was an eager clientele waiting in line on the first day of business. One customer even hugged Lisa to thank her for bringing coffee to the community.</p>
  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00039">The concept took off, and soon Lisa was a purveyor of fine coffee. Wired Coffee Bar was widely supported by the community. The local churches loved to meet for a coffee drink and connect with friends and neighbors. Throughout the day, business was conducted at the tables over a coffee, and into the evening hours college students gathered to study and talk with friends.</p>
  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00040">If you looked at the clientele throughout the day, you could see the “grab and go” customers who came every morning to get their mochas, lattes, and cappuccinos. Into the late-morning hours, the tables filled up with business meetings—builders and their new clients, PTA groups, pharmaceutical sales reps strategizing for the day and grabbing coffee for customers, and moms meeting for coffee before picking up kids at school. As the afternoon wore on, the seats would fill up with high school students meeting with tutors and friends to complete homework. The later evening hours had every seat filled with college students doing class projects or just “hanging out” with friends.</p>
  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00041">Wired Coffee Bar had a focused niche of coffee and community. The menu wasn’t complex. It featured just coffee—hot, iced, and frozen. Wired also offered a variety of teas that could be served hot or iced. Along with the drink options, customers could choose from a selection of sweet or savory locally baked muffins, scones, quiche, cookies, and coffee cakes. But Wired was not a restaurant; they were a true coffee bar.</p>
  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00042">With a regular and steady customer base, Wired could see the busier times happening when school was in session, and then summers saw a lighter revenue stream as the college students left and the local families took summer vacations out of town. The coffee business definitely needed the local support to offset the vacation schedules of the college students.</p>
  <p id="auto_f934773c-9e72-4130-9952-9d7beb84f5a8_para-00043">Just as Wired Coffee Bar was hitting its stride, new coffee shops started to enter the once-dormant community. Each new coffee location offered a drive-through, something Wired Coffee Bar never wants to be—fast-food coffee. As Lisa looked at ways to create more business, provide good coffee, and differentiate from the masses, she wondered if her concept could survive the hustle and the need for quicker service and a less laid-back atmosphere.</p>

In <a href="#page_8a610f38-2d5a-46ed-8d49-3f59e4956f85">Unit 1</a>, the stage was set for studying marketing. Unit 2 discusses the analytical tools and frameworks to understand a broad range of customers (whether consumers or businesses) and categorize them into target markets. It then reviews marketing research techniques used to gather data and make sound marketing decisions. Finally, the last two chapters of this unit emphasize the challenges of expanding to international markets and reaching culturally and demographically diverse segments in domestic markets.</p>
