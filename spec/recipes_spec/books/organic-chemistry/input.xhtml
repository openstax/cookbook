        We’ll ease into the study of organic chemistry by first reviewing some ideas about atoms, bonds, and molecular geometry that you may recall from your general chemistry course. Much of the material in this chapter and the next is likely to be familiar to you, but it’s nevertheless a good idea to make sure you understand it before moving on.

The answers to these questions are all around you. Every living organism is made of organic chemicals. The proteins that make up your hair, skin, and muscles; the DNA that controls your genetic heritage; the foods that nourish you; and the medicines that heal you are all organic chemicals. Anyone with a curiosity about life and living things, and anyone who wants to be a part of the remarkable advances taking place in medicine and the biological sciences, must first understand organic chemistry. Look at the following drawings for instance, which show the chemical structures of some molecules whose names might be familiar to you. Although the drawings may appear unintelligible at this point, don’t worry. They’ll make perfectly good sense before long, and you’ll soon be drawing similar structures for any substance you’re interested in.

Little was known about chemistry at that time, and the behavior of the “organic” substances isolated from plants and animals seemed different from that of the “inorganic” substances found in minerals. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_5b7a50a7-8dca-41c2-b49d-bc3e1a056f16_term-00003">Organic compounds</span> were generally low-melting solids and were usually more difficult to isolate, purify, and work with than high-melting inorganic compounds.

Why, of the more than 70 million presently known chemical compounds, do most of them contain carbon? The answers to these questions come from carbon’s electronic structure and its consequent position in the periodic table <a href="#auto_5b7a50a7-8dca-41c2-b49d-bc3e1a056f16_OChem_01_00_004.jpg" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. As a group 4A element, carbon can share four valence electrons and form four strong covalent bonds. Furthermore, carbon atoms can bond to one another, forming long chains and rings. Carbon, alone of all elements, is able to form an immense diversity of compounds, from the simple methane, with one carbon atom, to the staggeringly complex DNA, which can have more than <em data-effect="italics">100 million carbons.</em>

      As you might remember from your general chemistry course, an atom consists of a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded at a relatively large distance by negatively charged electrons <a href="#auto_c19a15a0-a63e-47f5-aa0c-42d09482b85d_OChem_01_01_001.jpg" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.

      Why, though, do atoms bond together, and how can chemical bonds be described electronically? The <em data-effect="italics">why</em> question is relatively easy to answer: atoms bond together because the compound that results is more stable and lower in energy than the separate atoms. Energy—usually as heat—is always released and flows out of the chemical system when a bond forms. Conversely, energy is added to the chemical system when a bond breaks. Making bonds always releases energy, and breaking bonds always absorbs energy. The <em data-effect="italics">how</em> question is more difficult. To answer it, we need to know more about the electronic properties of atoms.

      How does electron sharing lead to bonding between atoms? Two models have been developed to describe covalent bonding: <em data-effect="italics">valence bond theory</em> and <em data-effect="italics">molecular orbital theory</em>. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and chemists tend to use them interchangeably depending on the circumstances. Valence bond theory is the more easily visualized of the two, so most of the descriptions we’ll use in this book derive from that approach.

The electrons are now paired in the overlapping orbitals and are attracted to the nuclei of both atoms, thus bonding the atoms together. In the H<sub>2</sub> molecule, for instance, the H–H bond results from the overlap of two singly occupied hydrogen 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbitals.

    <p id="auto_9f01abe9-6f7e-42a3-9c2b-6a910f364f9e_para-00001">The bonding in the hydrogen molecule is fairly straightforward, but the situation is more complicated in organic molecules with tetravalent carbon atoms. Take methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, for instance. As we’ve seen, carbon has four valence electrons (<m:math display="inline"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mn>2</m:mn><m:msup><m:mi>s</m:mi><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup></m:mrow><m:annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><m:mn>2</m:mn><m:msup><m:mi>s</m:mi><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup></m:annotation-xml></m:semantics></m:math> <m:math display="inline"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mn>2</m:mn><m:msup><m:mi>p</m:mi><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup></m:mrow><m:annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><m:mn>2</m:mn><m:msup><m:mi>p</m:mi><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup></m:annotation-xml></m:semantics></m:math>) and forms four bonds. Because carbon uses two kinds of orbitals for bonding, 2<em data-effect="italics">s</em> and 2<em data-effect="italics">p</em>, we might expect methane to have two kinds of C–H bonds. In fact, though, all four C–H bonds in methane are identical and are spatially oriented toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron, as shown previously in <a href="#auto_df442eb4-bdf7-4989-b589-cc221f9fe38a_OChem_01_04_001.jpg" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.

    The concept of hybridization explains how carbon forms four equivalent tetrahedral bonds but not why it does so. The shape of the hybrid <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_9f01abe9-6f7e-42a3-9c2b-6a910f364f9e_term-00003">orbital</span> suggests the answer to why. When an <em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital hybridizes with three <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals, the resultant <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals are unsymmetrical about the nucleus. One of the two lobes is larger than the other and can therefore overlap more effectively with an orbital from another atom to form a bond. As a result, <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals form stronger bonds than do unhybridized<em data-effect="italics">s</em>or<em data-effect="italics">p</em>orbitals.
  </p>

  <p id="auto_9f01abe9-6f7e-42a3-9c2b-6a910f364f9e_para-00004">
    The asymmetry of <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>3</sup> orbitals arises because, as noted previously, the two lobes of a <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbital have different algebraic signs, + and –, in the wave function. Thus, when a <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbital hybridizes with an <em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital, the positive <em data-effect="italics">p</em> lobe adds to the <em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital but the negative <em data-effect="italics">p</em> lobe subtracts from the <em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital. The resultant hybrid orbital is therefore unsymmetrical about the nucleus and is strongly oriented in one direction.

    When each of the four identical <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals of a carbon atom overlaps with the 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbital of a hydrogen atom, four identical C–H bonds are formed and methane results.

    <p id="auto_0202c868-bb8e-4fd4-a878-dd57c5ba7fe5_para-00001">The valence-bond concept of orbital hybridization described in the previous four sections is not limited to carbon. Covalent bonds formed by other elements can also be described using hybrid orbitals. Look, for instance, at the nitrogen atom in methylamine (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>), an organic derivative of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and the substance responsible for the odor of rotting fish.

We therefore assume that nitrogen forms four <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>3</sup>-hybridized orbitals, just as carbon does. One of the four <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>3</sup> orbitals is occupied by two nonbonding electrons (a lone pair), and the other three hybrid orbitals have one electron each. Overlap of these three half-filled nitrogen orbitals with half-filled orbitals from other atoms (C or H) gives methylamine. Note that the unshared lone pair of electrons in the fourth <em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbital of nitrogen occupies as much space as an N–H bond does and is very important to the chemistry of methylamine and other nitrogen-containing organic molecules.

Having now seen the valence bond approach, which uses hybrid atomic orbitals to account for geometry and assumes the overlap of atomic orbitals to account for electron sharing, let’s look briefly at the molecular orbital approach to bonding. We’ll return to this topic in Chapters 14, 15, and 30 for a more in-depth discussion.</p>

      Like an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital has a specific size, shape, and energy. In the H<sub>2</sub> molecule, for example, two singly occupied 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em> atomic orbitals combine to form two molecular orbitals. There are two ways for the orbital combination to occur—an additive way and a subtractive way. The additive combination leads to formation of a molecular orbital that is lower in energy and roughly egg-shaped, while the subtractive combination leads to a molecular orbital that is higher in energy and has a node between nuclei (<a href="#auto_3b740daa-b80a-4c64-be10-69247add24b7_OChem_01_11_001.jpg" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Note that the additive combination is a single, egg-shaped, molecular orbital; it is not the same as the two overlapping 1<em data-effect="italics">s</em> atomic orbitals of the valence bond description. Similarly, the subtractive combination is a single molecular orbital with the shape of an elongated dumbbell.

    <p id="auto_e8416a43-c719-4db7-a87a-1ee7ec8bb673_para-00001">Let’s cover just one more point before ending this introductory chapter. In the structures we’ve been drawing until now, a line between atoms has represented the two electrons in a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_e8416a43-c719-4db7-a87a-1ee7ec8bb673_term-00001">covalent bond</span>. Drawing every bond and every atom is tedious, however, so chemists have devised several shorthand ways for writing structures.

If a carbon has three hydrogens bonded to it, we write CH<sub>3</sub>; if a carbon has two hydrogens bonded to it, we write CH<sub>2</sub>; and so on. The compound called 2-methylbutane, for example, is written as follows:

      Note that the horizontal bonds between carbons aren’t shown in condensed structures—the CH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>, and CH units are simply placed next to each other—but vertical carbon–carbon bonds like that of the first of the condensed structures drawn above is shown for clarity.

      One further comment: Although such groupings as –CH<sub>3</sub>, –OH, and –NH<sub>2</sub> are usually written with the C, O, or N atom first and the H atom second, the order of writing is sometimes inverted to H<sub>3</sub>C–, HO–, and H<sub>2</sub>N– if needed to make the bonding connections clearer. Larger units such as –CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> are not inverted, though; we don’t write H<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>C– because it would be confusing. There are, however, no well-defined rules that cover all cases; it’s largely a matter of preference.

    Contrary to what you may hear in supermarkets or on television, all foods are organic—that is, complex mixtures of organic molecules. Even so, when applied to food, the word <em data-effect="italics">organic</em> has come to mean an absence of chemicals made in the laboratory, typically pesticides, antibiotics, and preservatives. How concerned should we be about traces of pesticides in the food we eat? Or toxins in the water we drink? Or pollutants in the air we breathe?

    Life is not risk-free—we all take many risks each day without even thinking about it. We decide to ride a bike rather than drive, even though there is a ten times greater likelihood per mile of dying in a bicycling accident than in a car. We decide to walk downstairs rather than take an elevator, even though 7000 people die from falls each year in the United States. Some of us decide to smoke cigarettes, even though it increases our chance of getting cancer by 50%. But what about risks from chemicals like pesticides?

    One thing is certain: without pesticides, whether they target weeds (herbicides), insects (insecticides), or molds and fungi (fungicides), crop production would drop significantly, food prices would increase, and famines would occur in less developed parts of the world. Take the herbicide atrazine, for instance, a substance widely used for the control of broadleaf and grassy weeds. In the United States, approximately 100 million pounds of atrazine are used each year to kill weeds in corn, sorghum, and sugarcane fields, greatly improving the yields of these crops. Nevertheless, the use of atrazine continues to be a concern because traces persist in the environment and heavy atrazine exposure can pose health risks to humans and some animals. Despite its risks, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not banned its use because doing so would result in lower crop yields and increased food costs, and because there is no suitable alternative herbicide available.

    How can the potential hazards from a chemical like atrazine be determined? Risk evaluation of chemicals is carried out by exposing test animals, usually mice or rats, to the chemical and then monitoring the animals for signs of harm.

  So, should we still use atrazine? All decisions involve tradeoffs, and the answer is rarely obvious. Does the benefit of increased food production outweigh possible health risks of a pesticide? Do the beneficial effects of a new drug outweigh a potentially dangerous side effect in a small number of users? Different people will have different opinions, but an honest evaluation of facts is surely the best way to start. At present, atrazine is approved for continued use in the United States because the EPA believes that the benefits of increased food production outweigh possible health risks. At the same time, though, atrazine is little used in the European Union, though not banned.

    The purpose of this chapter has been to get you up to speed—to review some ideas about atoms, bonds, and molecular geometry. As we’ve seen, <strong>organic chemistry</strong> is the study of carbon compounds. Although a division into organic and inorganic chemistry occurred historically, there is no scientific reason for the division.

    An atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons. The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy <strong>orbitals</strong> around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, <em data-effect="italics">s</em> orbitals are spherical and <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The <strong>ground-state electron configuration</strong> of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.

  <p id="auto_e8416a43-c719-4db7-a87a-1ee7ec8bb673_para-00020">
    A <strong>covalent bond</strong> is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to <strong>valence bond (VB) theory</strong>, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to <strong>molecular orbital (MO) theory</strong>, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called <strong>sigma (σ) bonds</strong>; bonds formed by sideways interaction of <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals are called <strong>pi (π) bonds</strong>.

    In the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent <strong><em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sub>3</sub> hybrid orbitals</strong>. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent <strong><em data-effect="italics">sp</em><sub>2</sub> hybrid orbitals</strong> and one unhybridized <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent <strong>sp hybrid orbitals</strong> and two unhybridized <em data-effect="italics">p</em> orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals to form strong, oriented bonds.

    Organic molecules are usually drawn using either <strong>condensed structures</strong> or skeletal structures. In condensed structures, carbon–carbon and carbon–hydrogen bonds aren’t shown. In <strong>skeletal structures</strong>, only the bonds and not the atoms are shown. A carbon atom is assumed to be at the ends and at the junctions of lines (bonds), and the correct number of hydrogens is supplied mentally.

    <p id="auto_e8416a43-c719-4db7-a87a-1ee7ec8bb673_para-00052">There’s no surer way to learn organic chemistry than by working problems. Although careful reading and rereading of this text are important, reading alone isn’t enough. You must also be able to use the information you’ve read and be able to apply your knowledge in new situations. Working problems gives you practice at doing this.

    <p id="auto_e8416a43-c719-4db7-a87a-1ee7ec8bb673_para-00053">
      Each chapter in this book provides many problems of different sorts. The in-chapter problems are placed for immediate reinforcement of ideas just learned, while end-of-chapter problems provide additional practice and come in several forms. They often begin with a short section called “Visualizing Chemistry,” which helps you “see” the microscopic world of molecules and provides practice for working in three dimensions. After the visualizations are many “Additional Problems,” which are organized by topic. Early problems are primarily of the drill type, providing an opportunity for you to practice your command of the fundamentals. Later problems tend to be more thought-provoking, and some are real challenges.
    </p>
    <p id="auto_e8416a43-c719-4db7-a87a-1ee7ec8bb673_para-00054">
      As you study organic chemistry, take the time to work the problems. Do the ones you can, and ask for help on the ones you can’t. If you’re stumped by a particular problem, check the accompanying <em data-effect="italics">Study Guide and Solutions Manual</em> for an explanation that should help clarify the difficulty. Working problems takes effort, but the payoff in knowledge and understanding is immense.

In this chapter, we’ll look at some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation to understand the specific reactions discussed in subsequent chapters. Topics such as bond polarity, the acid–base behavior of molecules, and hydrogen-bonding are a particularly important part of that foundation.</p>

    <p id="auto_42ba2a28-f79f-4190-a719-b88db77e7617_para-00002">We saw in the previous chapter how covalent bonds between atoms are described, and we looked at the valence bond model, which uses hybrid orbitals to account for the observed shapes of organic molecules. Before going on to a systematic study of organic chemistry, however, we still need to review a few fundamental topics. In particular, we need to look more closely at how electrons are distributed in covalent bonds and at some of the consequences that arise when the electrons in a bond are not shared equally between atoms.</p>

Sodium transfers an electron to chlorine to produce Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>–</sup> ions, which are held together in the solid by electrostatic attractions between unlike charges. The C–C bond in ethane, however, is covalent. The two bonding electrons are shared equally by the two equivalent carbon atoms, resulting in a symmetrical electron distribution in the bond. Most bonds, however, are neither fully ionic nor fully covalent but are somewhere between the two extremes. Such bonds are called <span data-type="term" id="auto_2f4dab84-d1ad-4fd6-8446-f7a32e66c2cf_term-00001">polar covalent bonds</span>, meaning that the bonding electrons are attracted more strongly by one atom than the other so that the electron distribution between atoms is not symmetrical (<a href="#auto_2f4dab84-d1ad-4fd6-8446-f7a32e66c2cf_fig-00001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

    <p id="auto_09960c00-bd1d-4a6f-a6d3-7571f232a8e8_para-00001">Just as individual bonds are often polar, molecules as a whole are often polar as well. Molecular polarity results from the vector summation of all individual bond polarities and lone-pair contributions in the molecule. As a practical matter, strongly polar substances are often soluble in polar solvents like water, whereas less polar substances are insoluble in water.</p>

<p id="auto_09960c00-bd1d-4a6f-a6d3-7571f232a8e8_para-00002">Net polarity is measured by a quantity called the <em data-effect="italics">dipole moment</em> and can be thought of in the following way. Assume  that there is a center of mass of all positive charges (nuclei) in a molecule and a center of mass of all negative charges (electrons). If these two centers don’t coincide, then the molecule has a net polarity.</p>

<p id="auto_09960c00-bd1d-4a6f-a6d3-7571f232a8e8_para-00003">The <span data-type="term" id="auto_09960c00-bd1d-4a6f-a6d3-7571f232a8e8_term-00001">dipole moment</span>, <em data-effect="italics">μ</em> (lowercase Greek letter mu), is defined as the magnitude of the charge <em data-effect="italics">Q</em> at either end of the molecular dipole times the distance <em data-effect="italics">r</em> between the charges, <em data-effect="italics">μ</em> = <em data-effect="italics">Q</em> × <em data-effect="italics">r</em>. Dipole moments are expressed in <em data-effect="italics">debyes</em> (D), where 1 D = 3.336 × 10<sup>–30</sup> coulomb meters (C · m) in SI units. For example, the unit charge on an electron is 1.60 × 10<sup>–19</sup> C. Thus, if one positive charge and one negative charge are separated by 100 pm (a bit less than the length of a typical covalent bond), the dipole moment is 1.60 × 10<sup>–29</sup> C · m, or 4.80 D.</p>

Of the compounds shown in the table, sodium chloride has the largest dipole moment (9.00 D) because it is ionic. Even small molecules like water (<em data-effect="italics">μ</em> = 1.85 D), methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH; <em data-effect="italics">μ</em> = 1.70 D), and ammonia (<em data-effect="italics">μ</em> = 1.47 D), have substantial dipole moments, however, both because they contain strongly electronegative atoms (oxygen and nitrogen) and because all three molecules have lone-pair electrons. The lone-pair electrons on oxygen and nitrogen stick out into space away from the positively charged nuclei, giving rise to a considerable charge separation and making a large contribution to the dipole moment.</p>

Look at dimethyl sulfoxide (CH<sub>3</sub>SOCH<sub>3</sub>), for instance, a solvent commonly used for preserving biological cell lines at low temperature. The sulfur atom in dimethyl sulfoxide has three bonds rather than the usual two and has a formal positive charge. The oxygen atom, by contrast, has one bond rather than the usual two and has a formal negative charge. Note that an electrostatic potential map of dimethyl sulfoxide shows the oxygen as negative (red) and the sulfur as relatively positive (blue), in accordance with the formal charges.</p>

      <p id="auto_e91e0f57-815b-44ee-9a92-86adb940e1d5_para-00002">Formal charges, as the name suggests, are a formalism and don’t imply the presence of actual ionic charges in a molecule. Instead, they’re a device for electron “bookkeeping” and can be thought of in the following way: A typical covalent bond is formed when each atom donates one electron. Although the bonding electrons are shared by both atoms, each atom can still be considered to “own” one electron for bookkeeping purposes. In methane, for instance, the carbon atom owns one electron in each of the four C–H bonds. Because a neutral, isolated carbon atom has four valence electrons, and because the carbon atom in methane still owns four, the methane carbon atom is neutral and has no formal charge.</p>

Atomic nitrogen has five valence electrons, and the ammonia nitrogen also has five—one in each of three shared N–H bonds plus two in the lone pair. Thus, the nitrogen atom in ammonia has no formal charge.</p>

Atomic sulfur has six valence electrons, but the dimethyl sulfoxide sulfur owns only <em data-effect="italics">five</em>—one in each of the two S–C single bonds, one in the S–O single bond, and two in a lone pair. Thus, the sulfur atom has formally lost an electron and therefore has a positive formal charge. A similar calculation for the oxygen atom shows that it has formally gained an electron and has a negative charge. Atomic oxygen has six valence electrons, but the oxygen in dimethyl sulfoxide has seven—one in the O–S bond and two in each of three lone pairs. Thus, the oxygen has formally gained an electron and has a negative formal charge.</p>

    <p id="auto_342f6331-6fec-4a96-a68a-933e07426de1_para-00001">Most substances can be represented unambiguously by the Kekulé line-bond structures we’ve been using up to this point, but an interesting problem sometimes arises. Look at the acetate ion, for instance. When we draw a line-bond structure for acetate, we need to show a double bond to one oxygen and a single bond to the other. But which oxygen is which? Should we draw a double bond to the “top” oxygen and a single bond to the “bottom” oxygen, or vice versa?</p>

      <p id="auto_342f6331-6fec-4a96-a68a-933e07426de1_para-00004">A good way to think about resonance forms is to realize that a substance like the acetate ion is the same as any other. Acetate doesn’t jump back and forth between two resonance forms, spending part of the time looking like one and part of the time looking like the other. Rather, acetate has a single unchanging structure that we say is a <span data-type="term" id="auto_342f6331-6fec-4a96-a68a-933e07426de1_term-00002">resonance hybrid</span> of the two individual forms and has characteristics of both. The only “problem” with acetate is that we can’t draw it accurately using a familiar line-bond structure—line-bond structures just don’t work for resonance hybrids. The difficulty, however, is with the <em data-effect="italics">representation</em> of acetate on paper, not with acetate itself.</p>

      <p id="auto_342f6331-6fec-4a96-a68a-933e07426de1_para-00005">Resonance is a very useful concept that we’ll return to on numerous occasions throughout the rest of this book. We’ll see in <a href="">Benzene and Aromaticity</a>, for instance, that the six carbon–carbon bonds in aromatic compounds, such as benzene, are equivalent and that benzene is best represented as a hybrid of two resonance forms. Although each individual resonance form seems to imply that benzene has alternating single and double bonds, neither form is correct by itself. The true benzene structure is a hybrid of the two individual forms, and all six carbon–carbon bonds are equivalent. This symmetrical distribution of electrons around the molecule is evident in an electrostatic potential map.</p>

In other words, resonance leads to stability. Generally speaking, the larger the number of resonance forms a substance has, the more stable the substance is, because its electrons are spread out over a larger part of the molecule and are closer to more nuclei. We’ll see in <a href="">Benzene and Aromaticity</a>, for instance, that a benzene ring is more stable because of resonance than might otherwise be expected.</p>

    <p id="auto_89b02ede-15bf-4e3c-980b-d95fc70bf2cf_para-00001">Perhaps the most important of all concepts related to electronegativity and polarity is that of <em data-effect="italics">acidity</em> and <em data-effect="italics">basicity.</em> We’ll soon see, in fact, that the acid–base behavior of organic molecules explains much of their chemistry. You may recall from a course in general chemistry that two definitions of acidity are frequently used: the <em data-effect="italics">Brønsted–Lowry definition</em> and the <em data-effect="italics">Lewis definition.</em> We’ll look at the Brønsted–Lowry definition in this and the following three sections and then discuss the Lewis definition in <a href="#page_5cbe8a3e-140b-4c80-b50c-cd437228d7a4">Acids and Bases: The Lewis Definition</a>.</p>

<p id="auto_89b02ede-15bf-4e3c-980b-d95fc70bf2cf_para-00002">A <span data-type="term" id="auto_89b02ede-15bf-4e3c-980b-d95fc70bf2cf_term-00001">Brønsted–Lowry acid</span> is a substance that donates a hydrogen ion, H<sup>+</sup>, and a <span data-type="term" id="auto_89b02ede-15bf-4e3c-980b-d95fc70bf2cf_term-00002">Brønsted–Lowry base</span> is a substance that accepts a hydrogen ion. (The name <em data-effect="italics">proton</em> is often used as a synonym for H<sup>+</sup> because loss of the valence electron from a neutral hydrogen atom leaves only the hydrogen nucleus—a proton.) When gaseous hydrogen chloride dissolves in water, for example, a polar HCl molecule acts as an acid and donates a proton, while a water molecule acts as a base and accepts the proton, yielding chloride anion (Cl<sup>–</sup>) and hydronium cation (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). This and other acid–base reactions are reversible, so we’ll write them with double, forward-and-backward arrows.</p>

    <p id="auto_3d398acd-83b4-4969-a9a6-5c09f8b96ce4_para-00001">Different acids differ in their ability to donate H<sup>+</sup>. Stronger acids, such as HCl, react almost completely with water, whereas weaker acids, such as acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H), react only slightly. The exact strength of a given acid HA in water solution is described using the <span data-type="term" id="auto_3d398acd-83b4-4969-a9a6-5c09f8b96ce4_term-00001">acidity constant (<em data-effect="italics">K</em><sub>a</sub>)</span> for the acid-dissociation equilibrium. Recall from general chemistry that the concentration of solvent is ignored in the equilibrium expression and that brackets [ ] around a substance refer to the concentration of the enclosed species in moles per liter.</p>

     <!--<alt>A reversible chemical equation shows water as an acid when
mixed with water as a solvent releasing a hydroxide negative molecule
and a hydronium molecule. The second expression shows the chemical constant K subscript a as the product of hydronium represented as &#8220;H subscript 3 O superscript plus&#8221; and &#8220;A superscript minus&#8221; divided by &#8220;HA.&#8221; This equals to the product of a hydronium molecule and a hydroxide negative molecule divided by water molecule represented as &#8220;H subscript 2 O.&#8221; This equals to the product of 1 and 10 superscript minus 7 multiplied by the product of 1 and 10 superscript minus 7 divided by 55.4. This gives the result &#8220;1.8.&#8221; The final result shown is 10 superscript minus 16. The last expression shows the value of acid strength represented as &#8220;pK subscript a&#8221; to be &#8220;15.74.&#8221;</alt>-->

<p id="auto_3d398acd-83b4-4969-a9a6-5c09f8b96ce4_para-00006">The numerator in this expression is the so-called ion-product constant for water, <em data-effect="italics">K</em><sub>w</sub> = [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>][OH<sup>–</sup>] = 1.00 × 10<sup>–14</sup>, and the denominator is the molar concentration of pure water, [H<sub>2</sub>O] = 55.4 M at 25 °C. The calculation is artificial in that the concentration of “solvent” water is ignored while the concentration of “acid” water is not, but it is nevertheless useful for making a comparison of water with other weak acids on a similar footing.</p>

<p id="auto_3d398acd-83b4-4969-a9a6-5c09f8b96ce4_para-00007">Notice also in <a href="#auto_3d398acd-83b4-4969-a9a6-5c09f8b96ce4_fig-00001">Table 2.3</a> that there is an inverse relationship between the acid strength of an acid and the base strength of its conjugate base. A <em data-effect="italics">strong</em> acid has a <em data-effect="italics">weak</em> conjugate base, and a <em data-effect="italics">weak</em> acid has a <em data-effect="italics">strong</em> conjugate base. To understand this inverse relationship, think about what is happening to the acidic hydrogen in an acid–base reaction. A strong acid is one that loses H<sup>+</sup> easily, meaning that its conjugate base holds the H<sup>+</sup> weakly and is therefore a weak base. A weak acid is one that loses H<sup>+</sup> with difficulty, meaning that its conjugate base holds the proton tightly and is therefore a strong base. The fact that HCl is a strong acid, for example, means that Cl<sup>–</sup> does not hold H<sup>+</sup> tightly and is thus a weak base. Water, on the other hand, is a weak acid, meaning that OH<sup>–</sup> holds H<sup>+</sup> tightly and is a strong base.</p>

      <p id="auto_99e66dac-75b4-4e43-9559-342b907ea4b3_para-00002">Another way to predict acid–base reactivity is to remember that the product conjugate acid in an acid–base reaction must be weaker and less reactive than the starting acid and the product conjugate base must be weaker and less reactive than the starting base. In the reaction of acetic acid with hydroxide ion, for example, the product conjugate acid (H<sub>2</sub>O) is weaker than the starting acid (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H), and the product conjugate base (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>–</sup>) is weaker than the starting base (OH<sup>–</sup>).</p>

In both cases, acidity is due to the fact that the conjugate base resulting from loss of H<sup>+</sup> is stabilized by having its negative charge on a strongly electronegative oxygen atom. In addition, the conjugate base of acetic acid is stabilized by resonance (<a href="#page_342f6331-6fec-4a96-a68a-933e07426de1">RESONANCE</a> and <a href="#page_75a4288d-be74-4802-b0f1-862c0f687b03">RULES FOR RESONANCE FORMS</a>).</p>

Nitrogen-containing compounds such as methylamine are the most common organic bases and are involved in almost all metabolic pathways, but oxygen-containing compounds can also act as bases when reacting with a sufficiently strong acid.

For example, various metal cations, such as Mg<sup>2+</sup>, are Lewis acids because they accept a pair of electrons when they form a bond to a base. We’ll also see in later chapters that certain metabolic reactions begin with an acid–base reaction between Mg<sup>2+</sup> as a Lewis acid and an organic diphosphate or triphosphate ion as the Lewis base.</p>

A divalent oxygen compound has two lone pairs of electrons, and a trivalent nitrogen compound has one lone pair. Note in the following examples that some compounds can act as both acids and bases, just as water can. Alcohols and carboxylic acids, for instance, act as acids when they donate an H<sup>+</sup> but as bases when their oxygen atom accepts an H<sup>+</sup>.</p>

Acetic acid, for example, can be protonated either on the doubly bonded oxygen atom or on the singly bonded oxygen atom. Reaction normally occurs only once in such instances, and the more stable of the two possible protonation products is formed. For acetic acid, protonation by reaction with sulfuric acid occurs on the doubly bonded oxygen because that product is stabilized by two resonance forms.</p>

Although uniform on a time-averaged basis, the electron distribution even in nonpolar molecules is likely to be nonuniform at any given instant. One side of a molecule may, by chance, have a slight excess of electrons relative to the opposite side, giving the molecule a temporary dipole. This temporary dipole in one molecule causes a nearby molecule to adopt a temporarily opposite dipole, resulting in a tiny attraction between the two (<a href="#auto_0f2bb8ee-4eda-4995-878f-775a16b4bf97_fig-00002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).

  <p id="auto_0f2bb8ee-4eda-4995-878f-775a16b4bf97_para-00013">Understanding organic chemistry means knowing not just what happens but also why and how it happens at the molecular level. In this chapter, we’ve reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.</p>
  <p id="auto_0f2bb8ee-4eda-4995-878f-775a16b4bf97_para-00014">Organic molecules often have <strong>polar covalent bonds</strong> as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the <strong>electronegativity</strong> of atoms. A carbon–oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon–hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its <strong>dipole moment</strong>, <strong><em data-effect="italics">μ</em></strong>.</p>
  <p id="auto_0f2bb8ee-4eda-4995-878f-775a16b4bf97_para-00015">Plus (+) and minus (–) signs are often used to indicate the presence of <strong>formal charges</strong> on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.</p>
  <p id="auto_0f2bb8ee-4eda-4995-878f-775a16b4bf97_para-00016">Some substances, such as acetate ion and benzene, can’t be represented by a single line-bond structure and must be considered as a <strong>resonance hybrid</strong> of two or more structures, none of which would be correct by themselves. The only difference between two <strong>resonance forms</strong> is in the location of their <em data-effect="italics">π</em> and nonbonding electrons. The nuclei remain in the same places in both structures, and the hybridization of the atoms remains the same.</p>
  <p id="auto_0f2bb8ee-4eda-4995-878f-775a16b4bf97_para-00017">Acidity and basicity are closely related to the ideas of polarity and electronegativity. A <strong>Brønsted–Lowry acid</strong> is a compound that can donate a proton (hydrogen ion, H<sup>+</sup>), and a <strong>Brønsted–Lowry base</strong> is a compound that can accept a proton. The strength of a Brønsted–Lowry acid or base is expressed by its <strong>acidity constant, <em data-effect="italics">K</em><sub>a</sub></strong>, or by the negative logarithm of the acidity constant, <strong>p<em data-effect="italics">K</em><sub>a</sub></strong>. The larger the p<em data-effect="italics">K</em><sub>a</sub>, the weaker the acid. More useful is the Lewis definition of acids and bases. A <strong>Lewis acid</strong> is a compound that has a low-energy empty orbital that can accept an electron pair; Mg<sup>2<strong>+</strong></sup>, BF<sub>3</sub>, AlCl<sub>3</sub>, and H<sup>+</sup> are examples. A <strong>Lewis base</strong> is a compound that can donate an unshared electron pair; NH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O are examples. Most organic molecules that contain oxygen and nitrogen can act as Lewis bases toward sufficiently strong acids.</p>
  <p id="auto_0f2bb8ee-4eda-4995-878f-775a16b4bf97_para-00018">A variety of <strong>noncovalent interactions</strong> have a significant effect on the properties of large biomolecules. <strong>Hydrogen bonding</strong>—the attractive interaction between a positively polarized hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen or nitrogen atom with an unshared electron pair on another O or N atom, is particularly important in giving proteins and nucleic acids their shapes.</p>
