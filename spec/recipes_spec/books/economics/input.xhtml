The authors take a balanced approach to micro-and macroeconomics, to both Keynesian and classical views, and to the theory and application of economics concepts. The text also includes many current examples, which are handled in a politically equitable way. The second edition has been thoroughly revised to increase clarity, update data and current event impacts, and incorporate the feedback from many reviewers and adopters. </p><section data-depth="2" id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-887"><h4 data-type="title">Coverage and scope</h4><p id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-617">For the second edition, we received expansive and actionable feedback from hundreds of adopters who had used the book for several academic terms. These knowledgeable instructors informed the pedagogical courses, learning objective development and fulfillment, and the chapter arrangements. Faculty who taught from the material provided critical and detailed commentary.</p><p id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-id1169327261430">The result is a book that covers the breadth of economics topics and also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike.

<li><strong>Supply and Demand</strong>, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.</li>

<li><strong>The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory</strong>, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics portion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different models of market structure, including some simple game theory.</li>
<li><strong>Microeconomic Policy Issues</strong>, Chapters 11 through 18, covers the range of topics in applied micro, framed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities.  Students explore competition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor market issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, as well as public economy.</li>
<li><strong>The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals</strong>, Chapters 19 through 23, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows.</li>
<li><strong>A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis</strong>, Chapters 24 through 26, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.  The model is then applied to the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives.  The expenditure-output model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary and Fiscal Policy</strong>, Chapters 27 through 31, explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary policy and financial regulation.  Then the discussion switches to government deficits and fiscal policy.</li>

<li><strong>International Economics</strong>, Chapters 32 through 34, the final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

In the case of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, we received a wealth of constructive feedback.  Many of the book’s users felt that consequential movement in economic data, coupled with the impacts of national and global events, warranted a full revision. We also took advantage of the opportunity to improve the writing and sequencing of the text, as well as many of the calculation examples. The major changes are summarized below.</p><ul id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-447"><li>Augmented explanations in chapters one through four provide a more comprehensive and informative foundation for the book. </li>
<li>A clearer explanation, using a numerical example, has been given for finding the utility maximizing combination of goods and services a consumer should choose.</li>
<li>The Theory of Production has been added to the chapter on costs &amp; industry structure.</li>
<li> A more complete treatment has been given to labor markets, including the theories of competitive and monopsonistic labor markets, and bilateral monopoly; and the labor markets chapter and the poverty and
economic inequality chapter have been resequenced.</li>
<li>Substantial revisions to the AD/AS model in chapters 24-26 present the core concepts of macroeconomics in a clearer, more dynamic manner. </li>
<li>Case studies and examples have been revised and, in some cases, replaced to provide more relevant and useful information for students.</li>
<li>Economic data, tables, and graphs, as well as discussion and analysis around that data, have been thoroughly updated.</li> </ul><p id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-318">Wherever possible, data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) was included and referenced.  In most of these uses, links to the direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged to explore the information and the overall FRED resources more thoroughly.

</p><p id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-594">Additional updates and revisions appear throughout the book.  They reflect changes to economic realities and policies regarding international trade, taxation, insurance, and other topics.  For issues that may change in the months or years following the textbook's publication, the authors often provided a more open-ended explanation, but we will update the text annually to address further changes. </p><p id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-204">The revision of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> was undertaken by Steven Greenlaw (University of Mary Washington) and David Shapiro (Pennsylvania State University), with significant input by lead reviewer Daniel MacDonald (California State University, San Bernardino).</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-27"><h4 data-type="title">Pedagogical foundation</h4><p id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-987">Throughout the OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, you will find new features that engage the students in economic inquiry by taking selected topics a step further. Our features include:
</p><ul id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-213"><li><strong>Bring It Home:</strong> This added feature is a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter’s main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts:  the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the intro module) and the second at chapter’s end, when students have learned what’s necessary to understand the case and “bring home” the chapter’s core concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Work It Out:</strong> This added feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them step by step to find out how its solution is derived. </li>
<li><strong>Clear It Up:</strong> This boxed feature, which includes pre-existing features from Taylor’s text, addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts with a question.  The rest of the feature explains the answer.</li>
<li><strong>Link It Up:</strong> This added feature is a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students’ understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.  </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-651"><h4 data-type="title">Questions for each level of learning</h4><p id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-454">The OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> further expands on Taylor’s original end of chapter materials by offering four types of end of module questions for students:
</p><ul id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-284"><li><strong>Self-Checks</strong> are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They “click to reveal” an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think beyond what is said in the text.  Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through the problem.  </li>
<li><strong>Review Questions</strong> have been retained from Taylor’s version, and are simple recall questions from the chapter in open-response format (not multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text. </li>
<li><strong>Critical Thinking Questions</strong> are new higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to <em data-effect="italics">demonstrate their understanding by applying</em> what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for outside-the-box thinking, for <em data-effect="italics">reasoning</em> about the concepts. They push the student to places they wouldn’t have thought of going themselves.  </li>
<li><strong>Problems</strong> are exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and computational concepts in the module. </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-780"><h4 data-type="title">Updated art</h4><p id="auto_44954322-6754-4a69-aa9c-948e3ea86102_eip-26"><em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> includes an updated art program to better inform today’s student, providing the latest data on covered topics.

Decisions in the Social Media Age</div><p id="auto_dd99525b-50bb-40ff-ba1e-dd9e345183b4_fs-idm49900128">To post or not to post? Every day we are faced with a myriad of decisions, from what to have for breakfast, to which route to take to class, to the more complex—“Should I double major and add possibly another semester of study to my education?” Our response to these choices depends on the information we have available at any given moment. Economists call this “imperfect” because we rarely have all the data we need to make perfect decisions. Despite the lack of perfect information, we still make hundreds of decisions a day. </p><p id="auto_dd99525b-50bb-40ff-ba1e-dd9e345183b4_fs-idp9173408">Now we have another avenue in which to gather information—social media. Outlets like Facebook and Twitter are altering the process by which we make choices, how we spend our time, which movies we see, which products we buy, and more. How many of you chose a university without checking out its Facebook page or Twitter stream first for information and feedback? </p><p id="auto_dd99525b-50bb-40ff-ba1e-dd9e345183b4_fs-idp26732128">As you will see in this course, what happens in economics is affected by how well and how fast information disseminates through a society, such as how quickly information travels through Facebook. “Economists love nothing better than when deep and liquid markets operate under conditions of perfect information,” says Jessica Irvine, National Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.</p><p id="auto_dd99525b-50bb-40ff-ba1e-dd9e345183b4_fs-idm1264384">This leads us to the topic of this chapter, an introduction to the world of making decisions, processing information, and understanding behavior in markets —the world of economics. Each chapter in this book will start with a discussion about current (or sometimes past) events and revisit it at chapter’s end—to “bring home” the concepts in play. </p>

These can be individual decisions, family decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a fact of life. <span data-type="term">Scarcity</span> means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply. Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone, rich or poor, has just 24 expendable hours in the day to earn income to acquire goods and services, for leisure time, or for sleep. At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of resources available. </p><p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idp23700000">Think about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158 million workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total land area was 3,794,101 square miles. While these are certainly large numbers, they are not infinite. Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem. </p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_eip-826"><h3 data-type="title">Introduction to FRED</h3><p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_eip-id1170570855768">Data is very important in economics because it describes and measures the issues and problems that economics seek to understand. A variety of government agencies publish economic and social data. For this course, we will generally use data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's FRED database. FRED is very user friendly. It allows you to display data in tables or charts, and you can easily download it into spreadsheet form if you want to use the data for other purposes.

<p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idp30710144">If you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following: Does everyone require food to eat? Does everyone need a decent place to live? Does everyone have access to healthcare? In every country in the world, there are people who are hungry, homeless (for example, those who call park benches their beds, as <a href="#auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_CNX_Econ_C01_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows), and in need of healthcare, just to focus on a few critical goods and services. Why is this the case? It is because of scarcity. Let’s delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to understanding economics. </p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idp6791984"><h3 data-type="title">The Problem of Scarcity</h3>
<p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm5464496">Think about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. How do you acquire those items? You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the things you buy? You work for pay. If you do not, someone else does on your behalf. Yet most of us never have enough income to buy all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how do we solve it? </p><div data-type="note" id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm61672672" class="economics linkup"><p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm100076192">Visit this <a href="http://openstax.org/l/drought">website</a> to read about how the United States is dealing with scarcity in resources.</p>
    </div><p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm92457264">Every society, at every level, must make choices about how to use its resources. Families must decide whether to spend their money on a new car or a fancy vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the budget into police and fire protection or into the school system. Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to national defense or to protecting the environment. In most cases, there just isn’t enough money in the budget to do everything.  How do we use our limited resources the best way possible, that is, to obtain the most goods and services we can?  There are a couple of options.  First, we could each produce everything we each consume.  Alternatively, we could each produce some of what we want to consume, and “trade” for the rest of what we want.  Let’s explore these options. Why do we not each just produce all of the things we consume? Think back to pioneer days, when individuals knew how to do so much more than we do today, from building their homes, to growing their crops, to hunting for food, to repairing their equipment. Most of us do not know how to do all—or any—of those things, but it is not because we could not learn. Rather, we do not have to. The reason why is something called <em data-effect="italics">the division and specialization of labor</em>, a production innovation first put forth by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Adam Smith</span> (<a href="#auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_CNX_Econ_C01_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) in his book, <em data-effect="italics">The Wealth of Nations</em>. </p><figure id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_CNX_Econ_C01_008"><div data-type="title" id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_5">Adam Smith</div><figcaption>Adam Smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks.

<p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm75995888">The formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723–1790) published his famous book <em data-effect="italics">The Wealth of Nations</em> in 1776. Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the concept of <span data-type="term">division of labor</span>, which means that the way one produces a good or service is divided into a number of tasks that different workers perform, instead of all the tasks being done by the same person. </p><p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm95830048">To illustrate division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of wire, cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the other, and packaging pins for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that different people performed—all for a pin, believe it or not! </p><p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm48990176">Modern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides the task of serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills—not to mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe factory (<a href="#auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_CNX_Econ_C01_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications. </p><figure id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_CNX_Econ_C01_009"><div data-type="title" id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_7">Division of Labor</div><figcaption>Workers on an assembly line are an example of the divisions of labor.

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm44436912"><h3 data-type="title">Why the Division of Labor Increases Production</h3>
<p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm60480400">When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with producing a good or service, workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith noticed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to complete two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons. </p><p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm122368784">First, <span data-type="term">specialization</span> in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">comparative advantage</span>.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others. The particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, geography affects specialization. For example, it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they do best, they will be more effective than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and some of which they are not. </p><p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm51470800">Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better. </p>
<p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm10733072">A similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its “<span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">core competency</span>”) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products. </p><p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm62291680">Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of <span data-type="term">economies of scale</span>, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of his or her own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity. </p></section>

<p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm25012544">Specialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the other goods and services that they need. In short, specialization requires trade. </p>
<p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idp13130160">You do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to play music—you just buy an iPod or MP3 player, download the music, and listen. You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the construction of sewing machines if you need a jacket—you just buy the jacket and wear it. You do not need to know anything about internal combustion engines to operate a car—you just get in and drive. Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to consume, the market allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the goods and services you need or want. This is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy. </p></section>

<p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idp132016">Now that you have an overview on what economics studies, let’s quickly discuss why you are right to study it. Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to memorize, although there are plenty of important concepts to learn. Instead, think of economics as a collection of questions to answer or puzzles to work. Most importantly, economics provides the tools to solve those puzzles. If the economics “bug” has not bitten you yet, there are other reasons why you should study economics. </p><ul id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm173232"><li>Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from global warming, to world poverty, to the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you are going to be part of solving those problems, you need to be able to understand them. Economics is crucial. </li>
<li>It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good citizenship. You need to be able to vote intelligently on budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S. government came close to a standstill at the end of 2012 due to the “fiscal cliff,” what were the issues? Did you know? </li>
<li>A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker. When you read articles about economic issues, you will understand and be able to evaluate the writer’s argument. When you hear classmates, co-workers, or political candidates talking about economics, you will be able to distinguish between common sense and nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about current events and about personal and business decisions, as well as current events and politics. </li>
</ul><p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm217296">The study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can illuminate the different choices.</p>

<p id="auto_99d340b7-1345-4b77-87b4-747a7e2f5964_fs-idm77971456">Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a) It allows the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It encourages the agents to learn and invent; c) It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about economics helps you understand the major problems facing the world today, prepares you to be a good citizen, and helps you become a well-rounded thinker. </p>

<p id="auto_d70b25fe-374a-4553-b47e-a21422a6e1b4_fs-idm15153168">Economics is concerned with the well-being of <em data-effect="italics">all</em> people, including those with jobs and those without jobs, as well as those with high incomes and those with low incomes. Economics acknowledges that production of useful goods and services can create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the question of how investing in education helps to develop workers’ skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses or big labor unions are operating in a way that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating in a way that benefits their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks at how government spending, taxes, and regulations affect decisions about production and consumption. </p>

<p id="auto_d70b25fe-374a-4553-b47e-a21422a6e1b4_fs-idp4626272">It should be clear by now that economics covers considerable ground. We can divide that ground into two parts: <span data-type="term">Microeconomics</span> focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households, workers, and businesses. <span data-type="term">Macroeconomics</span> looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government deficits, and levels of exports and imports. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects, but rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject of the economy. </p><p id="auto_d70b25fe-374a-4553-b47e-a21422a6e1b4_fs-idm44860752">To understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of studying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific topics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees surrounding the lake. Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the lake's ecosystem from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this balance. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has a different viewpoint. </p><p id="auto_d70b25fe-374a-4553-b47e-a21422a6e1b4_fs-idp5949552">Whether you are scrutinizing lakes or economics, the micro and the macro insights should blend with each other. In studying a lake, the micro insights about particular plants and animals help to understand the overall food chain, while the macro insights about the overall food chain help to explain the environment in which individual plants and animals live. </p><p id="auto_d70b25fe-374a-4553-b47e-a21422a6e1b4_fs-idm59615920">In economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are influenced by whether the macroeconomy is healthy. For example, firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing. In turn, macroeconomy's performance ultimately depends on the microeconomic decisions that individual households and businesses make. </p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_d70b25fe-374a-4553-b47e-a21422a6e1b4_fs-idp49079232"><h3 data-type="title">Microeconomics </h3>
<p id="auto_d70b25fe-374a-4553-b47e-a21422a6e1b4_fs-idm5680000">What determines how households and individuals spend their budgets? What combination of goods and services will best fit their needs and wants, given the budget they have to spend? How do people decide whether to work, and if so, whether to work full time or part time? How do people decide how much to save for the future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond their current means? </p>
<p id="auto_d70b25fe-374a-4553-b47e-a21422a6e1b4_fs-idp43150560">What determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce and sell? What determines the prices a firm will charge? What determines how a firm will produce its products? What determines how many workers it will hire? How will a firm finance its business? When will a firm decide to expand, downsize, or even close? In the microeconomics part of this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior, the theory of the firm, how markets for labor and other resources work, and how markets sometimes fail to work properly.

<p id="auto_d70b25fe-374a-4553-b47e-a21422a6e1b4_fs-idp23578512">What determines the level of economic activity in a society? In other words, what determines how many goods and services a nation actually produces? What determines how many jobs are available in an economy? What determines a nation’s standard of living? What causes the economy to speed up or slow down? What causes firms to hire more workers or to lay them off? Finally, what causes the economy to grow over the long term? </p><p id="auto_d70b25fe-374a-4553-b47e-a21422a6e1b4_fs-idm36646496">We can determine an economy's macroeconomic health by examining a number of goals: growth in the standard of living, low unemployment, and low inflation, to name the most important. How can we use government macroeconomic policy to pursue these goals? A nation's central bank conducts <span data-type="term">monetary policy</span>, which involves policies that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets. For the United States, this is the Federal Reserve. A nation's legislative body determines <span data-type="term">fiscal policy</span>, which involves government spending and taxes. For the United States, this is the Congress and the executive branch, which originates the federal budget. These are the government's main tools. Americans tend to expect that government can fix whatever economic problems we encounter, but to what extent is that expectation realistic? These are just some of the issues that we will explore in the macroeconomic chapters of this book. </p></section>

<p id="auto_d70b25fe-374a-4553-b47e-a21422a6e1b4_fs-idm180944">Microeconomics and macroeconomics are two different perspectives on the economy. The microeconomic perspective focuses on parts of the economy: individuals, firms, and industries. The macroeconomic perspective looks at the economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the standard of living, unemployment, and inflation. Macroeconomics has two types of policies for pursuing these goals: monetary policy and fiscal policy. </p>

Keynes (<a href="#auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_CNX_Econ_C01_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) famously wrote in the introduction to a fellow economist’s book: “[Economics] is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking, which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions.” In other words, economics teaches you how to think, not what to think. </p><div data-type="note" id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_fs-idp57248112" class="economics linkup"><p id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_fs-idp159987488">Watch this <a href="http://openstax.org/l/Keynes">video</a> about John Maynard Keynes and his influence on economics.</p>

    </div><p id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_fs-idp34661824">Economists see the world through a different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or practitioners of any other discipline.  They analyze issues and problems using economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior. These assumptions tend to be different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use. A <span data-type="term">theory</span> is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other.   The purpose of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it down to its essentials. If done well, this enables the analyst to understand the issue and any problems around it. A good theory is simple enough to understand, while complex enough to capture the key features of the object or situation you are studying. </p><p id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_fs-idp129892576">Sometimes economists use the term <span data-type="term">model</span> instead of theory.  Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract representation, while a model is a more applied or empirical representation.  We use models to test theories, but for this course we will use the terms interchangeably. </p><p id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_fs-idp7072">For example, an architect who is planning a major office building will often build a physical model that sits on a tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the new building is constructed. Companies often build models of their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the final product, but can still demonstrate how the new product will work. </p><p id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_fs-idp123790320">A good model to start with in economics is the <span data-type="term">circular flow diagram</span> (<a href="#auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_CNX_Econ_C01_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups—households and firms—that interact in two markets: the <span data-type="term">goods and services market</span> in which firms sell and households buy and the <span data-type="term">labor market</span> in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees. </p><figure id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_CNX_Econ_C01_002"><div data-type="title" id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_5">The Circular Flow Diagram</div><figcaption>The circular flow diagram shows how households and firms interact in the goods and services market, and in the labor market. The direction of the arrows shows that in the goods and services market, households receive goods and services and pay firms for them. In the labor market, households provide labor and receive payment from firms through wages, salaries, and benefits.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_fs-idm122026608" data-alt="The circular flow diagram’s outer arrows represent a goods and services market, and the inner arrows represent a labor market.

    </figure><p id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_eip-417">Firms produce and sell goods and services to households in the market for goods and services (or product market).  Arrow “A” indicates this.  Households pay for goods and services, which becomes the revenues to firms.  Arrow “B” indicates this.  Arrows A and B represent the two sides of the product market.  Where do households obtain the income to buy goods and services? They provide the labor and other resources (e.g. land, capital, raw materials) firms need to produce goods and services in the market for inputs (or factors of production).  Arrow “C” indicates this.  In return, firms pay for the inputs (or resources) they use in the form of wages and other factor payments.  Arrow “D” indicates this.  Arrows “C” and “D” represent the two sides of the factor market.
</p><p id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_fs-idp5860544">Of course, in the real world, there are many different markets for goods and services and markets for many different types of labor. The circular flow diagram simplifies this to make the picture easier to grasp. In the diagram, firms produce goods and services, which they sell to households in return for revenues. The outer circle shows this, and represents the two sides of the product market (for example, the market for goods and services) in which households demand and firms supply. Households sell their labor as workers to firms in return for wages, salaries, and benefits. The inner circle shows this and represents the two sides of the labor market in which households supply and firms demand. </p><p id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_fs-idp44237760">This version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the essentials, but it has enough features to explain how the product and labor markets work in the economy. We could easily add details to this basic model if we wanted to introduce more real-world elements, like financial markets, governments, and interactions with the rest of the globe (imports and exports). </p>

<p id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_fs-idp5279008">Economists carry a set of theories in their heads like a carpenter carries around a toolkit. When they see an economic issue or problem, they go through the theories they know to see if they can find one that fits. Then they use the theory to derive insights about the issue or problem. Economists express theories as diagrams, graphs, or even as mathematical equations. (Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly use graphs.) Economists do not figure out the answer to the problem first and then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they use the graph of the theory to help them figure out the answer. Although at the introductory level, you can sometimes figure out the right answer without applying a model, if you keep studying economics, before too long you will run into issues and problems that you will need to graph to solve. We explain both micro and macroeconomics in terms of theories and models. The most well-known theories are probably those of supply and demand, but you will learn a number of others. </p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_fs-idp14982192" class="summary"><h3 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h3>
<p id="auto_6ed99720-2eaf-49e8-b816-73d2297ea6e8_fs-idp896016">Economists analyze problems differently than do other disciplinary experts. The main tools economists use are economic theories or models. A theory is not an illustration of the answer to a problem. Rather, a theory is a tool for determining the answer. </p>

<p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idm116325952">Think about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all production of goods and services, all buying and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small extent, with the economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who organizes and coordinates this system? Who ensures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the same as the amount it needs and wants? Who ensures that the right number of employees work in the electronics industry? Who ensures that televisions are produced in the best way possible? How does it all get done? </p>

<p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idm2603472">There are at least three ways that societies organize an economy. The first is the <span data-type="term">traditional economy</span>, which is the oldest economic system and is used in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family. Most families are farmers who grow the crops using traditional methods. What you produce is what you consume. Because tradition drives the way of life, there is little economic progress or development. </p><figure id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_CNX_Econ_C01_005"><div data-type="title" id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_3">A Command Economy</div><figcaption>Ancient Egypt was an example of a command economy.

<p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idm22896400">Command economies are very different. In a <span data-type="term">command economy</span>, economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids, like those in <a href="#auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_CNX_Econ_C01_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is another example: the lord provided the land for growing crops and protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided labor and soldiers to do the lord’s bidding. In the last century, communism emphasized command economies. </p><p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idp38251936">In a command economy, the government decides what goods and services will be produced and what prices it will charge for them. The government decides what methods of production to use and sets wages for workers. The government provides many necessities like healthcare and education for free. Currently, Cuba and North Korea have command economies. </p><figure id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_CNX_Econ_C01_006"><div data-type="title" id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_5">A Market Economy</div><figcaption>Nothing says “market” more than The New York Stock Exchange.

    </figure><p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idp41834384">Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies have a very decentralized structure. A <span data-type="term">market</span> is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange (<a href="#auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_CNX_Econ_C01_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) is a prime example of a market which brings buyers and sellers together. In a <span data-type="term">market economy</span>, decision-making is decentralized. Market economies are based on <span data-type="term">private enterprise</span>: the private individuals or groups of private individuals own and operate the means of production (resources and businesses). Businesses supply goods and services based on demand. (In a command economy, by contrast, the government owns resources and businesses.) Supply of goods and services depends on what the demands are. A person’s income is based on his or her ability to convert resources (especially labor) into something that society values. The more society values the person’s output, the higher the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James).  In this scenario, market forces, not governments, determine economic decisions.  </p><p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idm91198544">Most economies in the real world are mixed. They combine elements of command and market (and even traditional) systems. The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government involvement in economic decisions than the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while over the past several decades have moved more in the direction of having a market-oriented system, remain closer to the command economy end of the spectrum. The Heritage Foundation provides  perspective on countries’ economic freedom, as the following Clear It Up feature discusses. </p><div data-type="note" id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idm78296032" class="economics clearup"><div data-type="title" id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_7">What countries are considered economically free?</div><p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idp651728">Who is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they want and to work where they want? Are businesses free to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish? Are banks free to choose who will receive loans, or does the government control these kinds of choices? Each year, researchers at the Heritage Foundation and the <em data-effect="italics">Wall Street Journal</em> look at 50 different categories of economic freedom for countries around the world. They give each nation a score based on the extent of economic freedom in each category. Note that while the Heritage Foundation/WSJ index is widely cited by an array of scholars and publications, it should be regarded as only one viewpoint. Some experts indicate that the index’s category choices and scores are politically biased. However, the index and others like it provide a useful resource for critical discussion of economic freedom. </p><p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idp12476384">The 2016 Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world: <a href="#auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_Table_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> lists some examples of the most free and the least free countries. Although technically not a separate country, Hong Kong has been granted a degree of autonomy such that, for purposes of measuring economic statistics, it is often treated as a separate country. Several additional countries were not ranked because of extreme instability that made judgments about economic freedom impossible. These countries include Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. </p><p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idm133563488">The assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these rough measures can be useful for discerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom, although 77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall trend has been a <em data-effect="italics">higher level of economic freedom around the world</em>. </p><table id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_Table_01_01" summary="This table has two columns and ten rows.

<p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idp121002496">Markets and government regulations are always entangled. There is no such thing as an absolutely free market. Regulations always define the “rules of the game” in the economy. Economies that are primarily market-oriented have fewer regulations—ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants. At a minimum, these laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? The government heavily regulates decisions of what to produce and prices to charge. Heavily regulated economies often have <span data-type="term">underground economies</span> (or black markets), which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government’s approval. </p><p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idp9942944">The question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a black-or-white choice between all market or all government, but instead involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market freedom and government rules. </p>

One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods, services, and assets across national borders—in other words, international trade and financial capital flows. </p>
<p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idm185091664">Globalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container ship in <a href="#auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_CNX_Econ_C01_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations in computing and telecommunications have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of information—for example: computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and blueprints for designing a building. These products and many others can be transported over telephones and computer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries have encouraged greater trade. </p><p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idm189846048"><a href="#auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_Table_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> presents one measure of globalization. It shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2015, according to an entity known as The World Bank. <span data-type="term">Exports</span> are the goods and services that one produces domestically and sells abroad. <span data-type="term">Imports</span> are the goods and services that one produces abroad and then sells domestically. <span data-type="term">Gross domestic product (GDP)</span> measures the size of total production in an economy.

Interestingly, the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in part because large economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their national borders. However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their borders with other countries to take full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than most other countries. </p>
<p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idm149456880"><a href="#auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_Table_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> indicates that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China, have also experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit could put on special glasses that make all economic transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the astronaut would see the planet covered with connections. </p><p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_eip-856">Despite the rise in globalization over the last few decades, in recent years we've seen significant pushback against globalization from people across the world concerned about loss of jobs, loss of political sovereignty, and increased economic inequality. Prominent examples of this pushback include the 2016 vote in Great Britain to exit the European Union (i.e. Brexit), and the election of Donald J. Trump for President of the United States. </p><p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idm6274640">Hopefully, you now have an idea about economics.

Consider that as recently as the late 1970s, the <em data-effect="italics">Farmer’s Almanac</em>, along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest their crops. Today, farmers are more likely to access, online, weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or watch the Weather Channel. After all, knowing the upcoming forecast could drive when to harvest crops. Consequently, knowing the upcoming weather could change the amount of crop harvested. </p><p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idm106900864">Some relatively new information forums, such as Facebook, are rapidly changing how information is distributed; hence, influencing decision making. In 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that 71% of online adults use Facebook. This social media forum posts topics ranging from the National Basketball Association, to celebrity singers and performers, to farmers.</p><p id="auto_fd2d23a3-1ccd-4593-980e-d7027ab2d6a9_fs-idm62985712">Information helps us make decisions as simple as what to wear today to how many reporters the media should send to cover a crash. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are scarce. If the media send ten reporters to cover an accident, they are not available to cover other stories or complete other tasks. Information provides the necessary knowledge to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize scarce resources.

<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp55859248">(This appendix should be consulted after first reading <a href="#page_dd99525b-50bb-40ff-ba1e-dd9e345183b4">Welcome to Economics!</a>) Economics is not math. There is no important concept in this course that cannot be explained without mathematics. That said, math is a tool that can be used to illustrate economic concepts. Remember the saying a picture is worth a thousand words? Instead of a picture, think of a graph. It is the same thing. Economists use models as the primary tool to derive insights about economic issues and problems. Math is one way of working with (or manipulating) economic models.</p><p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp141516464">There are other ways of representing models, such as text or narrative. But why would you use your fist to bang a nail, if you had a hammer? Math has certain advantages over text. It disciplines your thinking by making you specify exactly what you mean. You can get away with fuzzy thinking in your head, but you cannot when you reduce a model to algebraic equations. At the same time, math also has disadvantages. Mathematical models are necessarily based on simplifying assumptions, so they are not likely to be perfectly realistic. Mathematical models also lack the nuances which can be found in narrative models. The point is that math is one tool, but it is not the only tool or even always the best tool economists can use. So what math will you need for this book? The answer is: little more than high school algebra and graphs. You will need to know:</p>

   

   <ul id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp9396560">
      <li>What a function is</li>
      <li>How to interpret the equation of a line (i.e., slope and intercept)</li>
      <li>How to manipulate a line (i.e., changing the slope or the intercept)</li>
      <li>How to compute and interpret a growth rate (i.e., percentage change)</li>
      <li>How to read and manipulate a graph</li>
    </ul>



<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm90918496">In this text, we will use the easiest math possible, and we will introduce it in this appendix. So if you find some math in the book that you cannot follow, come back to this appendix to review. Like most things, math has diminishing returns. A little math ability goes a long way; the more advanced math you bring in, the less additional knowledge that will get you. That said, if you are going to major in economics, you should consider learning a little calculus. It will be worth your while in terms of helping you learn advanced economics more quickly.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp12777936"><h3 data-type="title">Algebraic Models</h3>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp163417056">Often economic models (or parts of models) are expressed in terms of mathematical functions. What is a function? A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">function</span> describes a relationship. Sometimes the relationship is a definition. For example (using words), your professor is Adam Smith. This could be expressed as Professor = Adam Smith. Or Friends = Bob + Shawn + Margaret.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp169955968">Often in economics, functions describe cause and effect. The variable on the left-hand side is what is being explained (“the effect”). On the right-hand side is what is doing the explaining (“the causes”). For example, suppose your GPA was determined as follows:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="unnumbered" id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp98482096"><m:math display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mtext>GPA = 0.25 × combined_SAT + 0.25 × class_attendance + 0.50 × hours_spent_studying</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><m:mtext>GPA = 0.25 × combined_SAT + 0.25 × class_attendance + 0.50 × hours_spent_studying</m:mtext></m:annotation-xml></m:semantics></m:math></div>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp86730304">This equation states that your GPA depends on three things: your combined SAT score, your class attendance, and the number of hours you spend studying. It also says that study time is twice as important (0.50) as either combined_SAT score (0.25) or class_attendance (0.25). If this relationship is true, how could you raise your GPA? By not skipping class and studying more. Note that you cannot do anything about your SAT score, since if you are in college, you have (presumably) already taken the SATs.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp75133536">Of course, economic models express relationships using economic variables, like Budget = money_spent_on_econ_books + money_spent_on_music, assuming that the only things you buy are economics books and music.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp151044960">Most of the relationships we use in this course are expressed as linear equations of the form:</p>

<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp51829088">This example illustrates how the b and m terms in an equation for a straight line determine the shape of the line. The b term is called the y-intercept. The reason for this name is that, if x = 0, then the b term will reveal where the line intercepts, or crosses, the y-axis. In this example, the line hits the vertical axis at 9. The m term in the equation for the line is the slope. Remember that <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">slope</span> is defined as rise over run; more specifically, the slope of a line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal axis. In this example, each time the x term increases by one (the run), the y term rises by three. Thus, the slope of this line is three. Specifying a y-intercept and a slope—that is, specifying b and m in the equation for a line—will identify a specific line. Although it is rare for real-world data points to arrange themselves as an exact straight line, it often turns out that a straight line can offer a reasonable approximation of actual data.</p>

<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp111178496">The concept of slope is very useful in economics, because it measures the relationship between two variables. A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">positive slope</span> means that two variables are positively related; that is, when x increases, so does y, or when x decreases, y decreases also. Graphically, a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line rises. The length-weight relationship, shown in <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> later in this Appendix, has a positive slope. We will learn in other chapters that price and quantity supplied have a positive relationship; that is, firms will supply more when the price is higher.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp150995232">A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">negative slope</span> means that two variables are negatively related; that is, when x increases, y decreases, or when x decreases, y increases. Graphically, a negative slope means that, as the line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line falls. The altitude-air density relationship, shown in <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> later in this appendix, has a negative slope. We will learn that price and quantity demanded have a negative relationship; that is, consumers will purchase less when the price is higher.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm28729904">A slope of zero means that there is no relationship between x and y. Graphically, the line is flat; that is, zero rise over the run. <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_025" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> of the unemployment rate, shown later in this appendix, illustrates a common pattern of many line graphs: some segments where the slope is positive, other segments where the slope is negative, and still other segments where the slope is close to zero.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp29064288">The slope of a straight line between two points can be calculated in numerical terms. To calculate slope, begin by designating one point as the “starting point” and the other point as the “end point” and then calculating the rise over run between these two points. As an example, consider the slope of the air density graph between the points representing an altitude of 4,000 meters and an altitude of 6,000 meters:</p>

A higher positive slope means a steeper upward tilt to the line, while a smaller positive slope means a flatter upward tilt to the line. A negative slope that is larger in absolute value (that is, more negative) means a steeper downward tilt to the line. A slope of zero is a horizontal flat line.

<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp39003328">Growth rates are frequently encountered in real world economics. A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">growth rate</span> is simply the percentage change in some quantity. It could be your income. It could be a business’s sales. It could be a nation’s GDP. The formula for computing a growth rate is straightforward:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="unnumbered" id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp66186672"><m:math display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><m:mtr><m:mtd><m:mtext>Percentage change</m:mtext></m:mtd><m:mtd><m:mtext> = </m:mtext></m:mtd><m:mtd><m:mfrac><m:mtext>Change in quantity</m:mtext><m:mtext>Quantity</m:mtext></m:mfrac></m:mtd></m:mtr></m:mtable></m:mrow><m:annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><m:mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><m:mtr><m:mtd><m:mtext>Percentage change</m:mtext></m:mtd><m:mtd><m:mtext> = </m:mtext></m:mtd><m:mtd><m:mfrac><m:mtext>Change in quantity</m:mtext><m:mtext>Quantity</m:mtext></m:mfrac></m:mtd></m:mtr></m:mtable></m:annotation-xml></m:semantics></m:math></div><p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm49335232">Suppose your job pays $10 per hour. Your boss, however, is so impressed with your work that he gives you a $2 per hour raise. The percentage change (or growth rate) in your pay is $2/$10 = 0.20 or 20%.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm52797040">To compute the growth rate for data over an extended period of time, for example, the average annual growth in GDP over a decade or more, the denominator is commonly defined a little differently. In the previous example, we defined the quantity as the initial quantity—or the quantity when we started. This is fine for a one-time calculation, but when we compute the growth over and over, it makes more sense to define the quantity as the average quantity over the period in question, which is defined as the quantity halfway between the initial quantity and the next quantity. This is harder to explain in words than to show with an example. Suppose a nation’s GDP was $1 trillion in 2005 and $1.03 trillion in 2006. The growth rate between 2005 and 2006 would be the change in GDP ($1.03 trillion – $1.00 trillion) divided by the average GDP between 2005 and 2006 ($1.03 trillion + $1.00 trillion)/2. In other words:</p>

If you need a rough approximation, use the first method. If you need accuracy, use the second method.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm28526496">A few things to remember: A positive growth rate means the quantity is growing. A smaller growth rate means the quantity is growing more slowly. A larger growth rate means the quantity is growing more quickly. A negative growth rate means the quantity is decreasing.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp26419920">The same change over times yields a smaller growth rate. If you got a $2 raise each year, in the first year the growth rate would be $2/$10 = 20%, as shown above. But in the second year, the growth rate would be $2/$12 = 0.167 or 16.7% growth. In the third year, the same $2 raise would correspond to a $2/$14 = 14.2%. The moral of the story is this: To keep the growth rate the same, the change must increase each period.</p>

Graphs are a method of presenting numerical patterns. They condense detailed numerical information into a visual form in which relationships and numerical patterns can be seen more easily. For example, which countries have larger or smaller populations? A careful reader could examine a long list of numbers representing the populations of many countries, but with over 200 nations in the world, searching through such a list would take concentration and time. Putting these same numbers on a graph can quickly reveal population patterns. Economists use graphs both for a compact and readable presentation of groups of numbers and for building an intuitive grasp of relationships and connections.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm112471792">Three types of graphs are used in this book: line graphs, pie graphs, and bar graphs. Each is discussed below. We also provide warnings about how graphs can be manipulated to alter viewers’ perceptions of the relationships in the data.</p>

(The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">median</span> means that half of all babies weigh more than this and half weigh less.) The line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal axis and weight in pounds on the vertical axis. For example, point A on the figure shows that a boy who is 28 inches long will have a median weight of about 19 pounds. One line on the graph shows the length-weight relationship for boys and the other line shows the relationship for girls. This kind of graph is widely used by healthcare providers to check whether a child’s physical development is roughly on track.</p><figure id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_008"><div data-type="title" id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_5">The Length-Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls </div><figcaption>The line graph shows the relationship between height and weight for boys and girls from birth to 3 years.

The vertical axis measures the density of the air at each altitude. Air density is measured by the weight of the air in a cubic meter of space (that is, a box measuring one meter in height, width, and depth). As the graph shows, air pressure is heaviest at ground level and becomes lighter as you climb. <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows that a cubic meter of air at an altitude of 500 meters weighs approximately one kilogram (about 2.2 pounds).

If you were to collect actual data on air pressure at different altitudes, the same altitude in different geographic locations will have slightly different air density, depending on factors like how far you are from the equator, local weather conditions, and the humidity in the air. Similarly, in measuring the height and weight of children for the previous line graph, children of a particular height would have a range of different weights, some above average and some below. In the real world, this sort of variation in data is common. The task of a researcher is to organize that data in a way that helps to understand typical patterns. The study of statistics, especially when combined with computer statistics and spreadsheet programs, is a great help in organizing this kind of data, plotting line graphs, and looking for typical underlying relationships. For most economics and social science majors, a statistics course will be required at some point.</p>

The three pie graphs in <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_020" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> show that the share of the U.S. population 65 and over is growing. The pie graphs allow you to get a feel for the relative size of the different age groups from 1970 to 2000 to 2030, without requiring you to slog through the specific numbers and percentages in the table. Some common examples of how pie graphs are used include dividing the population into groups by age, income level, ethnicity, religion, occupation; dividing different firms into categories by size, industry, number of employees; and dividing up government spending or taxes into its main categories.</p>

<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp93924688">Now that you are familiar with pie graphs, bar graphs, and line graphs, how do you know which graph to use for your data? Pie graphs are often better than line graphs at showing how an overall group is divided. However, if a pie graph has too many slices, it can become difficult to interpret.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm32870480">Bar graphs are especially useful when comparing quantities. For example, if you are studying the populations of different countries, as in <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, bar graphs can show the relationships between the population sizes of multiple countries. Not only can it show these relationships, but it can also show breakdowns of different groups within the population.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm23342592">A line graph is often the most effective format for illustrating a relationship between two variables that are both changing. For example, time series graphs can show patterns as time changes, like the unemployment rate over time. Line graphs are widely used in economics to present continuous data about prices, wages, quantities bought and sold, the size of the economy.</p><p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp26205536"><strong data-effect="bold">How Graphs Can Be Misleading</strong></p>

<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm15492352">Suppose you wanted a graph which gives the impression that the rise in unemployment in 2009 was not all that large, or all that extraordinary by historical standards. You might choose to present your data as in <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a). <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) includes much of the same data presented earlier in <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_025" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, but stretches the horizontal axis out longer relative to the vertical axis. By spreading the graph wide and flat, the visual appearance is that the rise in unemployment is not so large, and is similar to some past rises in unemployment. Now imagine you wanted to emphasize how unemployment spiked substantially higher in 2009. In this case, using the same data, you can stretch the vertical axis out relative to the horizontal axis, as in <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b), which makes all rises and falls in unemployment appear larger.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm89821600">A similar effect can be accomplished without changing the length of the axes, but by changing the scale on the vertical axis. In <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (c), the scale on the vertical axis runs from 0% to 30%, while in <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (d), the vertical axis runs from 3% to 10%. Compared to <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_025" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, where the vertical scale runs from 0% to 12%, <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (c) makes the fluctuation in unemployment look smaller, while <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (d) makes it look larger.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm125921968">Another way to alter the perception of the graph is to reduce the amount of variation by changing the number of points plotted on the graph. <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (e) shows the unemployment rate according to five-year averages. By averaging out some of the year-to-year changes, the line appears smoother and with fewer highs and lows. In reality, the unemployment rate is reported monthly, and <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_017" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (f) shows the monthly figures since 1960, which fluctuate more than the five-year average. <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_017" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (f) is also a vivid illustration of how graphs can compress lots of data. The graph includes monthly data since 1960, which over almost 50 years, works out to nearly 600 data points. Reading that list of 600 data points in numerical form would be hypnotic. You can, however, get a good intuitive sense of these 600 data points very quickly from the graph.</p><p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm155257232">A final trick in manipulating the perception of graphical information is that, by choosing the starting and ending points carefully, you can influence the perception of whether the variable is rising or falling. The original data show a general pattern with unemployment low in the 1960s, but spiking up in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s, and late 2000s. <a href="#auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_CNX_Econ_A01_017" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (g), however, shows a graph that goes back only to 1975, which gives an impression that unemployment was more-or-less gradually falling over time until the 2009 recession pushed it back up to its “original” level—which is a plausible interpretation if one starts at the high point around 1975.</p><p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm64146304">These kinds of tricks—or shall we just call them “presentation choices”— are not limited to line graphs. In a pie chart with many small slices and one large slice, someone must decide what categories should be used to produce these slices in the first place, thus making some slices appear bigger than others. If you are making a bar graph, you can make the vertical axis either taller or shorter, which will tend to make variations in the height of the bars appear more or less.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm134027216">Being able to read graphs is an essential skill, both in economics and in life. A graph is just one perspective or point of view, shaped by choices such as those discussed in this section. Do not always believe the first quick impression from a graph. View with caution.</p>

<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm44564944">Math is a tool for understanding economics and economic relationships can be expressed mathematically using algebra or graphs. The algebraic equation for a line is y = b + mx, where x is the variable on the horizontal axis and y is the variable on the vertical axis, the b term is the y-intercept and the m term is the slope. The slope of a line is the same at any point on the line and it indicates the relationship (positive, negative, or zero) between two economic variables.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idm51750880">Economic models can be solved algebraically or graphically. Graphs allow you to illustrate data visually. They can illustrate patterns, comparisons, trends, and apportionment by condensing the numerical data and providing an intuitive sense of relationships in the data. A line graph shows the relationship between two variables: one is shown on the horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis. A pie graph shows how something is allotted, such as a sum of money or a group of people. The size of each slice of the pie is drawn to represent the corresponding percentage of the whole. A bar graph uses the height of bars to show a relationship, where each bar represents a certain entity, like a country or a group of people. The bars on a bar graph can also be divided into segments to show subgroups.</p>
<p id="auto_a4078b03-0419-4c50-9fb8-eb3e7f129ce6_fs-idp5680752">Any graph is a single visual perspective on a subject. The impression it leaves will be based on many choices, such as what data or time frame is included, how data or groups are divided up, the relative size of vertical and horizontal axes, whether the scale used on a vertical starts at zero. Thus, any graph should be regarded somewhat skeptically, remembering that the underlying relationship can be open to different interpretations.</p>
