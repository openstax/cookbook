The <em data-effect="italics">Introduction to Computer Science</em> textbook will realize its vision through a practical approach that focuses on the conceptual capabilities computer science provides to help build technical solutions to business problems. Manual business or social solutions typically involve processes that are applied by people at one or more locations. For example, the selling of insurance policies used to be delegated solely to insurance agents who met with customers in order to issue quotes and bind policies. Computer science has helped automate and replace manual solutions to business problems via information systems composed of applications that create or manipulate data and operate on top of technical infrastructures. Most insurance companies today have sophisticated websites that act as insurance portals where customers can obtain quotes and insurance policies on their own. When teaching intricate technical topics (such as Computer Systems Organization) that students are approaching for the first time, being able to relate to practical solutions is important to ensure that students remain engaged in the classroom and are able to identify real-world opportunities where this knowledge can be applied.
</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_5c1f0124-75ae-40e3-bd36-ff2bd10bbb6d_eip-69"><h4 data-type="title">A foundation and a bridge</h4><p id="auto_5c1f0124-75ae-40e3-bd36-ff2bd10bbb6d_eip-448">Many introductory texts in this discipline do not provide a straightforward path across the various underlying areas that make up the field. <em data-effect="italics">Introduction to Computer Science</em> will stand out by looking at the various areas as conceptual capabilities or building blocks and assembling them as a sequence that empowers students with a clear vision of computer science at the start of their academic studies. This foundation will be paired with the practical and solution-based approach highlighted across the book via chapter scenarios, features showcasing real-world examples and issues, and assessments that ask students to apply computational thinking to relevant and relatable problems.
</p><p id="auto_5c1f0124-75ae-40e3-bd36-ff2bd10bbb6d_eip-1000">It is also essential that the text integrate with other courses in computer science that students will take. These courses include (at the very least) Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Systems Organization, Operating Systems, Data Communications and Networks, Programming Languages, Database Systems, Software Engineering, Web Applications Development, Cloud Computing, and Society and Computer Science. Introduction to Computer Science will cover the material at a preliminary level so that students can gain additional knowledge as they take these more advanced courses. For non-majors, the resource will set the pace for a practical introduction to computer science that provides them with examples of how computational thinking can help them solve daily practical problems to prepare them for workforce experience. A goal of the book is that students—both majors and non-majors—will engage in activities and assessments that enable them to create artifacts of value that can be used to build career confidence. For example, learned skills should be relatable and translatable to opportunities with prospective employers and internship providers.</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="auto_5c1f0124-75ae-40e3-bd36-ff2bd10bbb6d_eip-464"><h4 data-type="title">Currency</h4><p id="auto_5c1f0124-75ae-40e3-bd36-ff2bd10bbb6d_eip-680">
Many of the core topics of an introductory computer science course will not change drastically over the next several years, but it is important that the resource be designed to evolve as technology progresses. For example, a transition to neuromorphic computing or quantum computing in the future could drastically affect topics such as Computer Systems Organization, Operating Systems, Data Communications, and Networks. However, progress in these upcoming areas is fairly slow and can be addressed through incremental changes via maintenance or mini updates. With faster evolution, the use of Machine Learning at various levels will keep growing and the material will need to address this evolution. It is likely that the material will be best taught in the future via a flipped classroom environment due to the growing variety of topics being covered and the need to work on practical problems with students to maximize their learning. A textbook structure that allows for regular mini updates, plus companion tools such as a playground environment, will facilitate a resource that is adaptable to evolving technologies as well as resulting shifts in how the material is taught.

  </figure><p id="auto_f27dc711-1bd0-409c-9f95-05eeff27ce3a_fs-idm381878112">The topics of Certification and Qualification feature prominently in the future of Additive Manufacturing (AM).  This is because AM is being developed in a wide range of industries to produce products with superior performance (weight, efficiency, cost, etc.), with the same reliability that conventional manufacturing has delivered for their customers.  While the many regulatory bodies and certifying agencies have very detailed definitions unique to their field, in their simplest form the two terms are:</p>



  <ul id="auto_f27dc711-1bd0-409c-9f95-05eeff27ce3a_fs-idm375375168"><li>Certification – A Component That Meets Design Intent is Fit for Service in a System</li>
    <li>Qualification – A Component Meets Design Intent, Including the Supplier, Machine, and Processing</li></ul><p id="auto_f27dc711-1bd0-409c-9f95-05eeff27ce3a_fs-idm380521088">Certification and qualification are not unique to highly regulated industries such as aerospace and medical.  Because of the severe consequences of unanticipated failure these industries they have some of the most codified requirements.  In this chapter, we will discuss certification and qualification in terms of AM, and how it applies over the full range of applications from both safety-critical to those that are relatively mundane.  Since part and system certification methods can be very industry-specific, it will be covered in general terms, along with common types of certifications (material, part, operator, etc.).  We will cover the full range of qualification methods in much more detail.  </p>

<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm377802960">By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
<ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm371379808">    <li>Understanding the range of product certifications </li>

  </ul></section>

<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm372748080">Certification is the act of saying (certifying) that a product meets the requirements it was produced against.  Certification can cover a wide range of products in an industry, from something as complex as an airplane, to something as simple as the raw material used to produce a part in that airplane.  In this section, we will discuss the full range of certifications that would be encountered in the production and delivery of an additively manufactured part.  We will use a modified version of the Systems Engineering V, as shown in Figure F06_01_syseng, to illustrate the different aspects of certification.</p>

<figure id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm366357200"><div data-type="title" id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_1">Modified Systems Engineering V</div><figcaption>Caption goes here.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm372461360" data-alt="."><img src="e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6/image001.png" data-media-type="png" alt="." id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_2" /></span></figure><p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm371381904">The Systems Engineering V starts in the upper-left corner, where the user/customer/regulator states the requirements that the system must meet.  In the case of a military aircraft, the user, customer, and regulator are the same, that being a country’s air force.  In the case of a civilian aircraft, they are different, where the user and customer are the same (airline) but the regulator is an airworthiness authority (FAA, EASA, etc.).  In the case of a medical device, such as a hip implant, the user is the patient, the customer is the hospital, and the regulator is a medical agency (Food and Drug Administration, Public Health Division).  In non-regulated industries, it can be even more complicated.</p>

<ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm376953616">
    <li>In the offshore oil and gas industry has the oil company as the user, an oilfield equipment company as the customer, and a third-party reviewer, such as Lloyd’s of London.</li>
    <li>In the case of an automobile company, while various government agencies have regulations regarding emissions, safety, and other aspects that provide basic requirements, the customer is the person who buys the car, and the head of marketing for the auto company essentially sets the system requirements to be something they can sell at sufficient profit.</li>
  </ul>

<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm371017232">It is typically the job of the Chief Engineer to integrate the different requirements into a successful design.  In the case of civilian aircraft, it needs to be safe to meet the regulator’s requirements, while also being efficient, reliable, and comfortable, to meet the airline’s requirements.  In the case of automotive, it needs to be efficient, comfortable, safe, and reliable, especially when one considers the cost of recalling and repairing a million vehicles.</p>

<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm367407872">Once the overall system requirements are defined, it is then necessary to determine the requirements for the subsystem, followed by the individual components.  This includes criticality (impact if the part fails), envelope, and reliability.  With requirements established, components are then designed and analyzed.  This marks the end of product definition and is followed by construction (building of parts and assemblies).  The final phase is testing to verify that the part/subsystem/system meets requirements.  This begins with part qualification, followed by sub-system testing, and finally system certification.  In the case of system certification for civilian aircraft, this can include hundreds of flight tests, full-scale static and fatigue testing of the airframe, stand testing of the engine, along with analyses and simulations.</p>

<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm378095968">Another aspect of certification that is especially applicable to a new manufacturing technology such as AM is known as but building block approach (Figure F06_01_bblock).  When introducing a new material, manufacturing process, or both for either a new or existing system, development and certification proceeds in a series of building blocks, starting at the bottom in the following order:</p>

<ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm378818928">
    <li>Selecting the material and process combinations that have the most promise to meet requirements</li>
    <li>Developing those materials and/or processes to lock them down and stabilize them</li>
    <li>Determining the design values</li>
    <li>Performing structural tests starting with small elements and joints, and moving to subcomponents</li>

<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm370718352">Example:  A bracket that attaches the overhead bins in an aircraft </p>
  <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm372615968">The brackets are required to not fail and drop luggage on the passengers if the aircraft crash-lands.  Mechanically, the bracket is expected to only be fully loaded once.  Because of the difficulty and risk entailed to correctly perform such a test, that part of the certification is done by analysis.  That is to say, the calculations related to the design, loads, and material properties are analyzed to show compliance with the requirements.</p>
<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm379596528">In the case of an AM part used in the overhead bins, we are concerned with analyzing two aspects:  1) the design of the part itself and how it attaches to the surrounding structure, and 2) the strength of the AM material comprising the part.  Because one of the benefits of AM is the ability to design parts of new, and more efficient geometries, additional structural analysis and verification may be necessary.  This may require subsystem tests in a lab on the part of the overhead bin attachment hardware that includes the AM part.  An example of a subsystem structural test for pipeline welds is shown in Figure F06_01_subsystem.  The part would be tested to a load greater than would be encountered in such a crash landing.  The other way in which the use of AM is involved in certification is the determination of the strength of the actual material of which the AM part is made, and how consistent those properties are.  This will be discussed in a later section.</p>

<ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm379735712">
    <li>Knowing the strength that a significant amount of the population of a material will have</li>
    <li>Knowing the physical properties of a material</li>
    <li>Understanding the relationships between material composition, processing, and strength</li>
    <li>Knowing the impact of environmental conditions on the material properties</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm370875888">The first of these often requires the development of what might be called “minimum” properties.  They are minimum properties because it is a statistical characterization describing what can be expected to be achieve a very high percentage of the time, so therefore the process should always be able to deliver higher properties ensuring the part’s success.  One can imagine that if a design used median properties, it could be expected that as much as half of the parts used would have insufficient strength to meet service needs.  In most industries, that would be considered a deficient design, and the system would not be certified.  Therefore, many industries use minimum material properties in determining a design.  Because knowing the true minimum properties of a material would require testing all of it, industries have developed methodologies for determining the minimum properties used for design.  </p>
<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm378152752">One of the most widely used methods is the aerospace industry standard known as Metallic Materials Properties Development and Standardization (MMPDS), currently in its 14th version.  The methods used in this standard have been developed over several decades with participation by the global aerospace industry and its regulators.  It contains a chapter of over 200 pages that lays out the methodology, requirements, and the means of presenting the data.  The types of Design Mechanical and Physical properties published in this are:</p>
<ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm372365808">
    <li>A-Basis Values – This is the value that 99% of the material will be stronger than with 95% confidence</li>
    <li>B-Basis Values – This is the value that 90% of the material will be stronger than with 90% confidence</li>
    <li>S-Basis Values – This is the minimum value that a specification will allow but does not have the statistical basis of A-Basis or B-Basis values.</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm381368608">The criticality of the part will often determine the need for A-Basis, B-Basis, or S-Basis values.  Because there are no published design properties for AM metals in MMPDS, we will use examples from wrought metals to illustrate these properties.  Figure F06_01_7050 contains the table of properties for 7050-T7451 aluminum alloy plate, made to the Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE) Aerospace Material Specification (AMS) 4050, while Figure F06_01_ti6al4v contains the table of properties for Annealed Ti-6Al-4V bar made to specification AMS 4911).</p>

<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm372523040">What is interesting in <a href="#auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm379392672" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, is that while A-Basis and B-Basis values are provided for most of the values, footnote b indicates that the A-Basis properties are actually a S-Basis values.  This is because the specification minimum is 130ksi, and 120ksi for ultimate and yield tensile strength.  Even though statistically the material has higher properties, it would be unwise to use those higher properties for design if the material is being accepted to a specification that allows lower-strength material.</p><p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm382410272">What can also be seen in looking at <a href="#auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm379392672" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> are that there are different sets of columns for different thicknesses.  This partially addresses item 3) above, which is understanding material, processing, and property relationships.  In the case of wrought aluminum alloy plate made to industry standards (which AMS 7050 requires), there is an inverse relationship between strength and thickness.  Additionally, the temper designation of T7451, means that these properties are achieved in material that has received this specific thermo-mechanical treatment (solution annealed, quenched, stretched, and overaged).  In the case of a developing technology like AM, the understanding of these variables is a work in progress.</p><p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm369057088">While the over 200 pages in MMPDS lays out the methodology, requirements, and the means of presenting the data is well established for wrought materials, the methods for AM materials still being developed.  One of the primary questions for AM is establishing the range of part geometries and processing parameters to include in a data set for determining the design values.  Until such methods are standardized and validated, design authorities are independently developing methods.  Depending on the circumstances, different approaches are being used, examples of which are:</p>
<ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm370759840">
    <li>Part Specific Design Values – This entails building a large number of the same part, excising test coupons from them, and deriving the properties based on the test results and applying the proper statistics</li>
    <li>Part Family Design Values – This can be developed from the start or can be an extension of Part Specific Design Values.  This entails building replicates of a number of parts that are closely related in terms of geometry and processing parameters, and deriving the properties based on the test results and statistics.  If done as an extension of Part Specific Design Values, it would usually involve building and testing parts similar to the original one and verifying consistency of properties.</li>
    <li>Feature Based Design Values – This is very much like those shown earlier for 7050-T7451 plate (thickness) and annealed Ti-6Al-4V bar (cross-sectional area).  The key challenge in developing these for AM is determining if there is any good relationship with features exist, and how to demonstrate that.  Would the appropriate ones be feature thickness, overall cross-sectional area, layer thickness, or some much more arcane definition?  Additionally, the appropriate feature for one material or process may not be appropriate for another one.</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm380926448">Item 4) above means that it is also necessary to understand environmental effects on material properties.  Figure F06_01_temptensile shows the effect of temperature on the tensile strength of Ti-6Al-4V bar.  Similarly, if an AM part is to be used in elevated temperature conditions, it will be necessary to have a similar understanding.</p>

<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm372608032">While most of the properties of interest are mechanical and physical properties, in some cases, product-specific properties are required.  Examples of these are:</p>
<ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm380360592">
    <li>Flame, smoke, and toxicity for materials used in aircraft cabins and passenger rail cars to prevent small fires from killing the passengers or preventing them from escaping.</li>
    <li>Chemical-specific corrosion properties in chemical plants.</li>
    <li>Ignition temperatures in automotive braking systems</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm369035872">In summary, certifying a system containing AM parts from engineering materials requires an understanding of the properties of the material as a function of composition, processing, and environmental effects on the part and the material it is made from.  As we now begin to cover qualification, it is important to keep in mind that the primary goal of qualification is demonstrating that the production system (factory, personnel, AM machines, post-processing, feedstock, and quality assurance measures) is capable of repeatably and reliably producing AM parts whose properties are consistent with those used to design the system.</p></section>

  <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm243518016">Most of the parts and materials used in the world are made using robust, repeatable processes with minimal post-fabrication inspections.  In industries where the consequences of failure can be high (aerospace, turbomachinery, nuclear, medical, oil &amp; gas, high-value costly to replace automotive), parts are often subjected to nondestructive testing, which is process of inspecting components or assemblies for discontinuities, or differences in characteristics without destroying the serviceability of the parts, to see if they contain any defects that would cause failure while in service.  Thus, the use of NDT to ensure freedom from defects that could cause in-service failure is integral to the certification of many systems.</p>

<p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm220611584">While more detailed definitions exist, for the purposes of this book, a defect is a discontinuity that may compromise the ability of a part to meet design intent.  While it can be expected that the above industries will continue to use NDT for AM parts, the lack of long-term service history may cause other industries, such as automotive, to consider the use of NDT until manufacturing and service history provides the data needed to eliminate it.  One unique aspect of AM is that since the parts are built in layers, the opportunity presents itself to inspect the part as it is built, known as In-Situ AM.  Related to this is the ability to gather and analyze significant amounts of data while a part is being built, which provides unprecedented ability to perform Process Monitoring or Process Control while the part is being built.</p>

<p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm218554496">Post-build NDT, often referred to as conventional NDT, is divided into volumetric and surface methods.  Volumetric methods look for discontinuities in the interior of a part or material, while surface methods look for discontinuities on the surface of a part.  Each of these methods have their own attributes, with surface methods generally considered more critical.  Surface discontinuities tend to have a greater impact on performance than subsurface ones due to higher stress concentrations and the potential for crevice corrosion.  It can be imagined one day, that in-situ NDT of AM may address both volumetric and surface inspections.  In the following paragraphs, each of the inspection technologies will be briefly described with relation to AM, followed by an example.</p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm223616000"><h3 data-type="title"> Radiographic Inspection</h3>
  <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm218339760">This original method of NDT is almost exclusively used for volumetric inspections and dates back to the days of Roentgen.  More about Roentgen here: <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1901/rontgen/biographical/">https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1901/rontgen/biographical/</a>  It can be used for the full range of AM materials.  It works by passing X-rays (although some systems use Gamma rays or neutrons) through a part and onto a detector.  Cracks and pores are found because they have less matter to absorb the X-rays so more hit the detector.  Inclusions (undesirable foreign material) are found because they either absorb more X-rays (higher density) or fewer X-rays (lower density).  General practice is that when more X-rays hit the detector, the image is darker, and when fewer hit the detector, the image is brighter.  It can be inferred that for a discontinuity to be detected, it must be oriented so that it has some thickness in the direction of the X-ray beam.  This means that planar discontinuities, such as cracks, may be difficult to detect, unless one knows their preferred orientation.</p>
<p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm234347056">While photographic film was the preferred detector until the 1980s, more and more industries are now using digital detectors to capture the image.  These offer significant benefits in terms of time, sensitivity, and ability to analyze the image.  The most sophisticated, and expensive, radiographic method is known as computed tomography (CT).  In this method, the part is rotated while being continually exposed to the X-rays and the detector continually collects the data.  The data is then processed to generate a 3D reconstruction of the part.  In addition to being used to detect and characterize discontinuities, CT can also generate a solid model for comparison with the actual design.  This extra capability can be quite useful in AM to determine if a complex part with internal passages meets dimensional requirements where conventional metrology would not be able to inspect.</p>
<figure id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm218294880"><figcaption>This figure shows a tool with conforming cooling passages where a radiographic inspection would be of interest.  For the purposes of this book, we will say the discontinuities of interest are pores, inclusions, and cracks.  Additionally, it is necessary to know that the cooling passages are the correct distance from the surface of the part.  A series of radiographic shots, as shown below, could be used to look for pores and cracks, with a typical sensitivity being 2% of material thickness (thus if the part is 50mm thick, pores above 1mm across could be detected), and to provide some information on the cooling channels.  The use of CT, however, would provide the ability to determine the actual geometry of the cooling channels and allow a digital comparison with the original model the part was built to.  One aspect of AM where complexity can a hindrance is in performing radiographic inspections.  While the part in Figure F06_02_conform is relatively simple, parts with large number for small features can have lots of noise around the edges of the features, making it difficult to interpret the radiographic results.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm222911136" data-alt=".">

  <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm248021312">One version of ultrasonic inspection, called surface wave inspection, is used as a surface or near-surface inspection.  This entails introducing a surface wave (called a Raleigh wave) into a part and then listening for it to reflect back off of a discontinuity.  Because surface wave inspection is relatively rare in industry, and would be so for AM, we will focus on the use of ultrasonic as a volumetric inspection method.  Ultrasonic inspection is effective in materials that transmit sound, such as metals and composites.  It is less effective in porous ceramics, neat polymers, or elastomers.  Volumetric ultrasonic inspection works much like sonar on a ship.  A pulse, generally between 1MHz and 20MHz, is sent out from a transducer.  </p>
<ul id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm249481328">
    <li>In the most common mode, called pulse-echo, the transducer, then listens for the pulse.  If it reflects off an internal discontinuity, the size and location can then be inferred by looking at the signal.  </li>
    <li>Another approach, called pitch-catch, uses a second transducer that listens for the signal reflecting off of the discontinuity.  This can be a benefit over the first for some geometries.  </li>
    <li>A third approach, called through-transmission, uses a second transducer that records the volume (amplitude) of the signal transmitted through the part.  </li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm248611536">While the first is used in metals and composites, and the second mainly in metals (especially welds), through-transmission is most commonly used for the inspection of composites.  Inspection of flat shapes will use general service probes, while more complicated shapes may use customized probes other devices (called shoes) to introduce the sound into the part.  The most complicated shapes often require building custom phased array ultrasonic probes, which contain an array of transducers specifically designed for the inspected geometry.  Figure XXX shows a phased array inspection of a conical brazed joint.  All of these methods are best for finding discontinuities that are oriented perpendicular to the direction of sound.  Thus, radiography (good at finding discontinuities parallel to the beam direction) and ultrasonic inspection can be very complimentary, which is why they are often used together in the inspection of welds.</p><figure id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm251736912"><figcaption>Phased array inspection a) setup of probe and sample in the inspection tank, and b) inspection of braze joint showing non-bonded areas in red.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm232365360" data-alt=".">

</figure><p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm242884672">The primary challenges in performing ultrasonic inspection of AM parts are due to geometric complexity and surface roughness.  Because the sound needs to be introduced into and received out of the part, the geometry needs to be relatively simple to allow both access for the transducer and the ability to have some area of contact.  Additionally, a predictable back surface is needed.  Finally, the wave needs room to propagate, so thin or narrow features are difficult to inspect.  In conventional manufacturing, most ultrasonic inspections are performed on simple shapes, such as rectangular plates or round bars.  The rough or irregular surfaces of many AM parts also make inspection difficult, as a smooth, consistent surface to introduce the sound into the part.</p>

  <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm234930272">Eddy-current inspection is primarily a surface inspection method, although discontinuities within 1mm of the surface can be detected with the correct set-up.  Eddy-current uses an electromagnetic coil (generally between 10Hz and 4Mhz, depending on material and application) to induce eddy-currents in the part.  Thus, only conductive materials can be inspected.  The presence of a physical discontinuity will disturb the eddy-currents, which is picked up the test equipment.  Eddy-current testing requires a reasonably smooth surface, so the rough surfaces of AM parts can be a significant hinderance.  It can also be very labor-intensive.  As a result, it is often relegated to inspecting small areas, where a production discontinuity or fatigue crack is suspected.</p>
<p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm242540480">A good example of an eddy-current inspection is the bicycle frame shown in Figure 7.  Because of the bionic design, there are few, if any, single load path areas.  The exception is where it attaches to the rear wheels or the front wheel/handlebar area.  It could be imagined that fatigue cracks could originate in these areas as a result of extensive mountain biking, or regular commuting in Amsterdam.  An application of eddy-current would be to inspect in those areas after the completion of a race, or once a month in the commuter’s case.</p>

  <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm230843392">Like Eddy-current, magnetic particle inspection can detect surface and near-surface (also up to ~1mm deep) discontinuities.  A prerequisite for this inspection method is that the material in question be reasonably ferromagnetic (alloy steels or PH stainless steels).  Magnetic particle inspection works by inducing a magnetic field in the part and applying magnetic particulate matter to highlight areas where the magnetic field is disturbed.  These are areas of potential cracks, laps, etc.  Needless to say, the rough surfaces and undercuts in many AM parts would generate many false positive indications, so magnetic particle inspection would be limited to smooth surfaces. </p>

  <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm249472304">Due to the ability to use a common inspection procedure, applicability to all nonporous materials, and quick examination time, penetrant inspection is the most common surface inspection method in industry.  A discontinuity must be open to the surface in order for penetrant inspection to work, as the method entails using capillary action to draw the penetrant into the discontinuity, which then bleeds back out after the excess penetrant is removed and a developer is applied.  Like magnetic particle and eddy-current inspection, linear discontinuities around 1.5mm and above are typically detected with high-sensitivity fluorescent penetrant materials.  Also, like magnetic particle and eddy-current inspection, the ability to inspect is significantly compromised by rough surfaces.  Additionally, surfaces must be free of grease and oils.  Finally, for the high-sensitivity penetrants, machines parts with yield strengths under 1500MPa require a pre-penetrant etch to remove any smeared metal.  The combination of these often means penetrant inspection requires cleaning and acid or alkaline etch tanks, which is why the inspection is often performed by specialist chemical processing contractors.</p>

  <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm234908912">This method treats each part like a tuning fork, although in many cases the sound is outside of the audible range.  The part is loosely held and tapped in a controlled method.  The sound coming off the part will have a characteristic resonance frequency that is detected with a specialized microphone and analyzed.  Changes in the resonance frequency may be the result of either discontinuities or discrepant geometry.  Because it is quick to perform, resonance inspection can be used as the primary inspection to screen parts as acceptable or questionable, with the questionable part inspected using another method for final disposition.</p>

  <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm235533024">Thermographic inspection involves imaging an area with an infrared camera to look for differences in temperature.  The inspection can be either passive (using background thermal energy to look for hot or cold spots) or active (applying heat via flash lamps or the like and looking for hot or cold spots).  Outside of AM, thermographic inspection is often used to inspect areas where a coating may be bonded onto a surface to check for unbonded areas.  This also takes advantage of one of its advantages, which is being noncontact and able to inspect large areas quickly.  Within AM, it is being developed and implemented for process monitoring and in-situ NDT.</p>

  <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm237237728">Because of the difficulty of inspecting AM parts post-build, and the opportunity to inspect parts while they are being built, process monitoring, process control, and In-Situ NDT are being implemented and developed.  We will start with defining the three terms:</p>
<ul id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm236538656">
    <li>Process Monitoring – Monitoring the inputs and responses of a process while it is being performed to see that it is operating within limits.</li>
    <li>Process Control – Using data from process monitoring to change the inputs to a process to keep it within desired limits.</li>
    <li>In-Situ NDT - Inspections performed while a part is being made using AM.</li>
  </ul>
  <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm247513072">Because AM is an inherently digital process, and because the machines produce large amounts of data, Process Monitoring is the most widely applied of the three.  Ideally, Process Monitoring is performed while the process is active, although it can be applied post-built as part of an accept/evaluate/reject decision tree.  A wide range of process parameters can be monitored.  These include input parameters (laser input power, recoater voltage, arc current, gas flow rate, etc.) or output parameters (melt puddle size, bed surface temperature, laser energy, etc.).  The key is reliably determining how the parameters correlate with either an acceptable part, a rejectable part, or a suspect part that requires further evaluation, which is made more challenging in that the definition may be geometry dependent.  Making this determination is being helped by the use of a range of data analytics and machine learning tools that are now available.</p>
<p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm240240560">Process Control will often use the same sensors and data as Process Monitoring.  The difference is that the AM machine uses the results of the sensing and analysis to determine if a process is going out of the desired limits and makes changes to the input parameters to keep it within its desired limits.  Needless to say, this must be done while the process is active so the changes can be made as part of a closed loop.  While not as widely used as Process Monitoring, Process Control is beginning to appear on newer-generation AM machines with increasingly sophisticated sensors and analysis methods.</p>
<p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm222668944">Making parts without discontinuities is always the goal.  Depending on the industry and the part requirements such as, the criticality of the part and the level of confidence in the process, NDT may still be required.  In AM, the best time to perform this may be while the part is being built, either to achieve desired level of sensitivity and reliability, minimize NDT cost, or to avoid continuing to add value to a part that is not acceptable.  In-Situ NDT may look very much like Process Monitoring and use the same sensors and analysis methods.  The difference, however, is that the output of the analysis is a determination that a region of a part contains or does not contain an unacceptable discontinuity and its approximate size.</p>
<p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm234912720">The decision to use Process Monitoring, Process Control, In-Situ NDT, or Post-Build NDT or some combination of the four, and the methods to be used requires the input of a combination of disciplines and needs to be integrated into the overall design and build of the system as part of the overall certification of that system.</p></section>

  <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm242613136">Key to the effective use of NDT is knowing the size of discontinuities that can be detected.  Ideally, the NDT methods used to inspect a part can detect discontinuities that are smaller than those that will cause a part to not meet design intent; that is, smaller than the applicable defect size.  One measure of this is knowing the smallest possible discontinuity a method can detect on a part, often referred to as the minimum detectable defect size, Because of the complexities of part geometry, discontinuity geometry, operator skill, etc., however, having an absolute size for what can be detected in a part is rarely possible.  Thus, the term Probability of Detection (PoD) is used to refer to the size of discontinuity that can be detected with a good chance of success.  A typical definition of success is being able to find 90% of the discontinuities above a certain size with 95% confidence.  Depending on the material, part geometry, type of discontinuity and NDT method, parts with either actual or simulated discontinuities in the locations of interest and of a range of sizes will undergo NDT multiple times to statistically determine that value.</p>
<p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm235716688">The final stage in integrating NDT with design and analysis is determining the effects of defects (EoD).  That is, how do different discontinuities of different sizes impact the performance of a material.  This type of testing is often done when a new material or process is introduced, or it is used for the first time in a new application, especially one that is loaded in fatigue or where damage tolerance is needed.  EoD testing often requires:</p>
<ul id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm237579520">
    <li>Building test parts with intentional discontinuities</li>
    <li>Performing NDT on the parts to see if the discontinuities are detectable and to characterize their apparent size</li>
    <li>Testing the parts to failure to see the impact on either the static strength, fatigue life, or fracture stress</li>
    <li>Correlating the size estimated by NDT, actual size, and impact on performance</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm229730352">When this is completed successfully, the results are analyzed and the size of discontinuity that needs to be detected is determined.  Ideally, this size is larger than the size that can be detected with confidence.  If not, changes to the design and/or materials and processes need to be made.  In the case of AM, many industries are just beginning studies to determine both the detectable sizes and the effects of defects. </p>

<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm235281296">By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm210517824">    <li>Understand the different levels of qualification (part, supplier, machine), how they apply to different industries, and how qualification can be achieved.</li>
    <li>Understand how qualification may extend to facilities and processes outside of the printer</li>
    <li>Understand how qualification is linked to certification and design</li>
  </ul></section>

<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm231503088">Like certification, qualification can apply to a wide variety of activities, ranging from a very high level (a factory is qualified to make AM hardware) to a very low level (a part is qualified for production).  While each of these qualifications apply to different aspects of the producing of AM hardware, in the end, each of them points to the ability to repeatably make hardware that meets the engineering requirements and will perform as expected in service.</p>

<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm232691408">A simple example of the relationship between certification and qualification would be the design of a rope swing, and the rope has to withstand a 10,000 N load.  The engineer specifies a 10mm diameter nylon rope and hangs a 15,000 N weight from it (10,000 N x a safety factor of 1.5) from the rope as part of the certification process.  Needing a reliable supply of rope, the rope swing company goes to a variety of rope manufacturers with a specification requiring 10mm diameter nylon rope that can withstand 15,000 N without failing.  The rope manufacturers submit to the swing maker the results of tests on their 10mm ropes showing that their rope can withstand 15,000 N without failing.  At this point, the swing maker qualifies several rope manufacturers as suppliers, and adds them to a qualified producer list (QPL).  In brief terms:</p>

<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm215735424">
    <li>The swing maker certifies that their rope swing design is fit for service.  The design that is certified specifies the kind of rope that can be used</li>
    <li>The swing maker qualifies rope manufacturers as suppliers of conforming rope</li>
    <li>A further take on this is that the rope manufacturers qualify suppliers of nylon strand that conforms to the rope manufacturer’s specification to be used for making 10mm diameter rope.</li>
  </ul>

<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm219338112">The comparison with the AM industry is the system (airplane) builder is the swing maker, the rope manufacturer is the AM part maker, and the strand supplier is the powder production facility.</p>

  <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm208724640">Facility is the highest level of qualification and is usually the result of some of the other qualification types, as well has having the business, manufacturing, training, and other quality processes integrated throughout the operations.  This qualification often involves the coordination of different organizations such as:</p>
<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm229485264">
    <li>Facility Quality and Management – Organization that will be using the machine to make parts</li>
    <li>Part Customer – Organization that will be receiving parts made on the machine</li>
    <li>Industry Group or 3rd Party Organization – Organization that represents the part customer, as part of a larger industry organization.  Examples of these are NADCAP, Lloyd’s Registry, etc.</li>
    <li>Regulatory Agency – Governmental body or industry group </li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm232259792">Typical expectations for a qualified AM facility would be:</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm215884016">Overall Quality Management System – This often requires that the facility operates in accordance with an industry-approved specification, such as ISO-9000, AS-9100 (aerospace), or ISO-13485 (medical).  Typical parts of the overall quality management system are:</p>
<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm225989312">
    <li>Understanding customer and contract requirements</li>
    <li>Organized and documented leadership roles and responsibilities</li>
    <li>Involvement of employees, which includes personnel training and qualification</li>
    <li>Control of business, manufacturing, and other processes.  This includes control of materials, designs (build files) software, machines, work instructions (build programs), operators, inspectors, etc.</li>
    <li>Closed-loop improvement processes – Monitoring production and making improvements in a controlled fashion, or taking timely corrective action when things go wrong.</li>
    <li>Data-based decision making</li>
    <li>Management of relationships with suppliers and subcontractors</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm215774432">Approved AM-Related Processes and Equipment – Prior to receiving a facility qualification, it is usually necessary for the AM-related processes and equipment to be qualified.  Examples of these are:</p>
<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm229696576">
    <li>Feedstock handling and tracking</li>
    <li>At least one qualified AM machine</li>
    <li>Qualified operators for the machines</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm205833584">Non-AM-Related Processes and Equipment – This can apply to processes outside of the actual print operations.  In some cases, these processes are performed within the facility, or they may be performed in sister facilities or subcontractors, which have been approved.  Examples of these processes and equipment that may require approval are:</p>
<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm220166400">
    <li>Heat treatment</li>

    <li>Nondestructive testing</li>
    <li>Mechanical and material testing</li>
    <li>Dimensional inspection</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm232667712">A qualified AM facility consists of qualified personnel, equipment, and processes working together in an integrated fashion to reliably produce AM hardware that meets requirements and is consistently being improved in a controlled fashion.</p>

  <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm218644304">A qualified AM machine is one that can reliably produce AM parts that meet requirements.  As the AM industry matures, machine qualification is coalescing on a staged approach that closely aligns with medical equipment qualification.  The stages differ in the propose of the testing, feedstock used during the testing, types of testing being done, the pass/fail criteria, and who is involved in the qualification testing, and determining a machine to be qualified.  The different types of organizations involved are:</p>
<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm249481328">
    <li>Machine Builder – Organization that designs and builds the machine</li>
    <li>User – Organization (Facility) that will be using the machine to make parts</li>
    <li>Part Customer – Organization that will be receiving parts made on the machine</li>
    <li>Industry Group or 3rd Party Organization – Organization that represents the part customer, as part of a larger industry accreditation organization.  Examples of these are Nadcap and Lloyd’s Registry.</li>
    <li>Regulatory Agency – Governmental body or industry group </li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm227707536">Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) – Factory acceptance testing is usually conducted at the site at which the machine is built and performed by employees of the machine builder, to determine whether a hardware and software of the product satisfies the requirements.  Since FAT occurs before the machine is accepted by the user, it is sometimes considered outside the realm of qualification, but either way, it is considered a prerequisite to the other qualification stages.  FAT is also good practice as it provides data to a default or baseline known point.  FAT essentially consists of the machine builder verifying that the machine operates as intended.  The involved parties are the machine builder and the user.  In the case of smaller machines (e.g. 250mm class Laser Powder Bed Fusion machines), this testing takes place at the factory where the machine was built.  In the case of large Direct Energy Deposition or Material Extrusion machines where the machine is assembled for the first time in the user’s facility, this would take place at the user’s facility.</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm205442784">FAT consists of a number of operational tests to verify compliance with the machine specification.  Some of these tests will check the performance of individual sub-systems, examples of which are:</p>
<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm232307616">
    <li>Testing the optical train on a L-PBF machine by scanning the laser over the build area that has a series of detectors installed to measure beam profile, placement accuracy, consistency, and power.</li>
    <li>Translating the deposition head on a DED or ME machine over the full build volume to verify accuracy and repeatability over that volume.</li>
    <li>Measuring the protective gas flow on a machine to verify the lack of dead spots in coverage</li>
    <li>Measuring the heating tip temperature on a ME machine.</li>
    <li>Testing the powder recoating system over a range of powder sizes and layer thicknesses to verify range of operation.</li>
    <li>Verifying operation of the feedstock handling system by checking material feed rates or dosing rates.</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm222851776">While the feedstock used for the actual tests may be a standard material specified by the machine builder, it is more commonly that material the user intends to put in the machine in production.  This is not only to avoid potential contamination issues, but to have a continuity of material type from FAT through Installation Qualification, Operational Qualification, and Part Qualification.  After these tests have been successfully completed, FAT will often culminate with making a series of test parts that validate the performance of the machine over a range of geometries and location within the build volume.  These geometries are generally determined by the machine builder as ones that provide the best information on the performance of the machine in the shortest amount of time and cost.  Figure F06_02_fat shows an example test part.  Post-build dimensional inspection is the most common, with radiographic, CT scanning, and surface roughness measurements often employed.  Additionally, the log files that were generated during the builds are analyzed for any anomalies.  After successful completion of FAT, the machine is then disassembled to the extent necessary and shipped to the user’s facility.</p>

IQ, sometimes known as Site Acceptance Testing (SAT), almost always takes place at the user’s facility, after the machine has been received, installed, and re-assembled.  In the case of machines that are only assembled at the user’s facility, IQ and FAT may be performed simultaneously to reduce time and cost.   In many cases, the first stage of IQ is repeating all of the FAT testing to ensure that the newly re-assembled machine performs the same as it did at the factory.  A SAT may include the FAT initially but then increase in scope to the user’s definition if they possess or add capability to the standard machine and thus becomes the default condition for the user which is then different than the original factory.</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm244278864">IQ will often consist of additional tests required by the machine user.  In the case where final payment on the machine is contingent on passing IQ, the machine builder will also be involved in designing the tests and determining pass/fail criteria.  Depending on the industry, the part customer or a 3rd party may also be involved.  While some of these acceptance tests are subsystem diagnostic type tests, they will usually include building test parts that are representative of the geometries that the user is intending to make with the machine.  The intended production feedstock is almost always used for this testing, for the aforementioned reasons.  Figure F06_02_iq shows an example IQ component.  In addition to the tests performed for FAT, additional tests sometimes include chemistry, microstructural, dissection, and mechanical property tests.  Depending on the testing performed, post-processing may be necessary.  Mechanical testing at this stage would generally require exceeding specification minimums.</p>

<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm249545200">The requirements for OQ are generally found in the specification used by the part customer to procure production hardware.  While in most cases, the specification used for OQ are proprietary to the part customer, the general push is to move to industry-standard specifications.  Examples of this are AWS D20.1 (Specification for Fabrication of Metal Components using Additive Manufacturing) and AMS 7032 (Additive Manufacturing Machine Qualification).  The specification will either include or reference a specification that contains the full range of qualification tests, along with the relevant pass/fail criteria.</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm227671136">OQ will use the feedstock intended for production, as the end result is the approval to use the machine to make production hardware to a specification that includes the feedstock and final part material.  Feedstock from a qualified source (covered in 6.2.5) is also generally required.  Full post-processing may need to be performed to properly perform certain tests like chemistry, microstructure, and mechanical properties.  These will also need to be performed by post-processors who have the necessary approvals from the part customer or 3rd party.</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm248223248">Because the objective of OQ is to demonstrate that the machine and feedstock combination are capable of repeatably making hardware that conforms to specification, the following are often part of an OQ:</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm216178464">Test material comes from the full volume of the machine that will be used for production.  While this is potentially the full build volume of the machine, in many cases, certain parts of the build volume, will not be used to make production hardware.  In this case, test material would not come from these regions, and the qualification documents would state which areas of the build volume are excluded.  An example of this is shown in Figure F06_02_qualbuild. Qualification Volume is the portion of the build volume qualified to make the specified hardware. </p>
<figure id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm221338656"><div data-type="title" id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_5">Relationship Between Build Volume and Qualification Volume</div><span data-type="media" id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm235388624" data-alt="."><img src="0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106/image021.png" data-media-type="png" alt="." id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_6" /></span></figure><p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm235519664">Multiple lots of material.  While some specifications allow all of the test material to come from a single build, others will require 2 or more builds.  These builds may allow the same, or they may require different feedstock lots.  Same for post-processing operations.  The objective is to show that the machine can produce conforming material multiple times.  The specification may even require that the builds be non-consecutive or that the feedstock contain a range of chemistry within the range allowed by the feedstock specification.  An example of a test plan containing multiple lots is shown in Figure F06_02_testplan, where the requirement is for 3 different build lots, and a minimum of 2 different feedstock lots.  Note how the coupons at spread around the qualification volume to ensure testing material from the whole volume, which includes Z-direction specimens with the ends outside the qualification volume, but the gage sections (where the strength is measured) within the qualification volume.  In the case of this example, chemistry and microstructure tests will be done on material in the grip areas of the specimens, but additional coupons or excess material could also be used.  It should be noted that designing the test builds for qualification to meet all of the coupon size, orientation, and location requirements can be quite challenging.  Making spare coupons is recommended because it is possible to have a “bad” test that would then invalidate the qualification by having insufficient tests.</p>

<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm214771312">Hardware meets specification requirements.  This means that the parts and coupons built during the qualification builds meets all of the specification requirements for chemistry, microstructure, dimensions, NDT, minimum mechanical properties, etc.  An example of this is shown in Figure F06_02_tensilechem.  A review of this shows that all of the tensile properties exceed the minimum values, and all of the interstitial gas contents are below the maximum values.</p>

<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm229504528">An example of this is shown in Figure F06_02_consistant.  Note the bottom three rows of the table, which contain the mean, standard deviation, and mean – 3 standard deviations.  The high scatter in the X-Direction testing (41 MPa standard deviation, versus 20 MPa for the design value population) means that the potential minimum values for the process (899 UTS and 849 YS) falls below that of the design value population, even though the actual values are all above the specification minimum.  There are many methods to compare data sets to see if they are the same population, some of which are described in MMPDS.  In this example, the high scatter in UTS strongly suggests that the process is different from that used to develop the design values, and the machine would fail OQ if consistency were one of the criteria.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm220737184"><h3 data-type="title"> Part Qualification</h3>
  <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm205595520">While prototyping, risk reduction, and pre-production development for a part may be performed prior to machine qualification, part qualification may only take place on a machine that has been qualified, except in instances where the engineering authority allows simultaneous machine and part qualification.  In part qualification, the user is demonstrating that the combination of the feedstock, machine, general build process (as documented in the PCD), and the part-unique processes produces a part that not only conforms to the general part specification, but also to the Engineering requirements for the part.  This part qualification can consist of 3 to 5 activities:</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm246505648">Build File and Build – After the qualification part or parts are built, the log file for that build, like the builds for OQ, are reviewed and analyzed for any anomalies that would normally have caused the build to be halted or the parts rejected.</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm230058336">Engineering Lot and Part Acceptance – Once the build has been deemed to be acceptable, the qualification part or parts are subjected to the post-processing, lot acceptance testing (chemistry, witness tensile coupons, etc.) and part acceptance testing (dimensional and NDT).  In the case where final part machining would prevent destructive coupon testing, that post-processing may be omitted.</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm219545840">First Article Testing – In the general case, first article testing refers to any testing that is performed on a first article or articles that would not be performed on production articles.  For the purposes of this, it will refer to additional dimensional and NDT.  Examples of first article testing are:</p>
<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm243685184">
    <li>While part acceptance testing may require dimensional inspection of key interface and other critical dimensions, first article testing may consist of making a 3-D point cloud of the whole part and comparing it to the model.  This could also include detailed surface roughness measurements.</li>
    <li>While part acceptance may require film radiographic inspection of the part, first article testing may also include CT scanning the part.  This can also be used to generate a part model to compare to the Engineering model.</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm214813168">Destructive Testing – As has been practiced in the forging and casting industries for decades, or even centuries, one or more of the first articles may be destructively tested.  Examples of this type of testing are:</p>
<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm236603840">
    <li>Excising mechanical test coupons from the part to verify that the mechanical properties of the material in the part meets specification requirements.  In most cases, the only requirement is to meet specification minimums, but for parts that are critical or have low design margins, it may be required that sufficient coupons may be tested to compare the mean values and property scatter.  Depending on the part and the number of coupons needed, it may be necessary to destructively test multiple parts.  Additionally, the properties of the coupons excised from the part should be compared with any witness mechanical test coupons used for lot acceptance.  This is shown in Figure F06_02_witness.  In this example, two parts were destructively tested, with 6 X-direction, 2 Y-direction, and 4 Z-direction coupons excised from the parts.  In addition, 2 X-direction and 2-Z-direction tests were performed from the lot witness coupon.  In the case of this data set, it can be seen that the all of the tensile values are higher than the specification minimum, and the UTS and YS values are higher than the Design Value Population Mean.  While the number of tests are too small for a true statistical comparison, it is apparent that the part properties are consistent or better than the Design Value Population.  Finally, the values from the part are higher than those from the witness coupon, which indicates that the witness coupon will provide an early indicator if the process drifts out of control and the overall properties get lower.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Excising macrostructure (approximately 10x – 50x magnification) and microstructure (&gt;50x magnification) coupons to make sure the material in the part matches what would be expected.  For all materials, this would be looking for porosity, lack of fusion, laps, inclusions, etc. that are too small to be detected with NDT or visual methods.  In the case of metals, this would include grain size, orientation, and the presence of strengthening or deleterious phases).  In the case of composites, it would be reinforcement content, size, orientation, and distribution.</li>
    <li>Perform dimensional inspection of features that cannot be accessed in normal production or with nondestructive first article testing, such as the roughness of internal cavities or the dimensions and straightness of micro-trusses.  These can be compared with engineering assumptions.</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm230547552">If multiple parts are made in the same build or lot, a decision needs to be made to perform first article testing of one, some, or all parts, and the extent of the testing.  A common approach would be to perform the additional dimensional and NDT tests on all the parts, but only perform destructive testing on either one or two of the parts, or parts in the extremes of the build volume.  </p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm244801808">Part or System Component Qualification Testing – The most involved, and often most expensive form of first article testing is performing a component qualification test on the entire part.  This can consist of testing the part individually or as part of a subsystem or system.  They type of testing can be static, fatigue or even impact/fracture testing.  In the case of a subsystem or system test, the part is installed in a test system, is usually highly instrumented, and the entire subsystem or system is subjected to qualification testing.  An example of that could be the testing of an AM manifold for a hydraulic system.  </p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm248852576">In the case of an individual component test, an elaborate fixture for introducing the loads into the part is designed and built.  The part is highly instrumented and installed into the fixture, like that shown in Figure 2, and the part is subjected to the load or loads that the design authority has determined is appropriate for the qualification test.  Because of the time and expense of such testing, it is often done either for the initial qualification of a material/process combination or design concept, with the results of the test used to support qualification of future parts without component testing.</p>

  <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm222754784">The previous paragraphs described a qualification structure where machines are qualified, and then each individual part is qualified.  While this approach is appropriate in many cases, it can be quite costly and time-consuming, especially when a machine or cell of identical machines is making a large number of similar parts.  An alternate approach, commonly known in the medical industry as Process Qualification (PQ) or Process Validation (PV), and referred to in other industries as a Part Family approach.</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm237342816">This will be illustrated using HIP Implant Stems.  While those shown in Figure F06_02_hipimplant were probably not made using AM, it can be seen that they are very related in geometry and function, with the difference being their sizes and the ribbing.  As a medical replacement part, it can be imagined that a manufacturer would need multiple machines to meet the production rate on most of the parts, which will be discussed later.  The desirability of performing PQ on this family parts is apparent.  Instead of qualifying each part individually, the manufacturer could develop a common process (location and orientation in the build chamber, build parameters, post-build thermal processing, finishing), and qualify by testing the extremes and the middle of the process windows.  As new variants are added, a lower level of qualification (potentially just NDT, dimensional, and a single destruct article) may be needed.</p>

  <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm227746992">The challenge of digital connectivity may start with the data that one might be trying to capture but increasingly there is a disconnect between how long it takes to acquire the data and the window of time that the information is relevant or actionable. We will get into this in more detail throughout the discussions within Additive Manufacturing with examples on how individual errors in a build layer may disqualify an entire 20 hour build. In conventional manufacturing similar gaps persists, especially as it refers to quality assurance. Presumably most organizations have some quality metrics in place to ensure that the parts that are being produced fulfill the customer requirements. Most of these metric systems are able to pick out an individual part or batch of parts that are out of spec once the full part is built. Digital tools based on the machine can now identify problems earlier on in the part manufacturing process. Signal irregularities or even electrical disturbances can be gleaned from mundane machine sensors and relayed back to computer systems that aim to keep a long term cumulative view of the machine performance. </p>

  <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm216073600">As manufacturing trends towards further digital approaches there will be many more opportunities to combine traditional forming, joining, and subtractive technologies with the digital thread of 3D Printing. In fact, unlocking the data that will help critical operations optimizing will be a competitive advantage that cannot be overlooked. </p>

<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm249296560">
    <li>Apprentice – Able to operate equipment under supervision of a Journeyman or Master.  Generally, not qualified for critical parts.</li>
    <li>Journeyman – Able to operate equipment without supervision.  May supervise apprentices.  Could be qualified for critical parts.</li>
    <li>Master – Able to operate equipment without supervision and supervise apprentices.  Qualified for critical parts.  Responsible for other aspects of an AM facility, such as approving build files, signing off on maintenance, administering qualification of Apprentices and Journeymen.</li>
  </ul>

  <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm233693776">Without feedstock that reliably meets specification, any manufacturing process will be hard-pressed to repeatably produce hardware that meets requirements, hence the need to qualify feedstock.  The use of a qualified feedstock is almost always a requirement for OQ, Part Qualification, or PQ.  The specification the covers printing and processing the AM parts will generally require the use of feedstock qualified to a specification.  ASTM and SAE (AMS Series) are issuing a series of feedstock specifications for many of the commonly used powders, wires, and filaments.  Where a public specification does not exist, or where different controls are needed, organization will issue their own proprietary specifications.  Feedstock specifications contain requirements for items such as:</p>
<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm218257184">
    <li>Classifications – Sub-categories</li>
    <li>Chemistry – Intentional Constituents</li>
    <li>Chemistry – Unintentional Constituents or Contaminants</li>
    <li>Method of Manufacture</li>
    <li>Product Form and Size – Powder size distribution, wire/filament diameter, foil thickness</li>
    <li>Physical Properties – Density, Flow Rate, etc</li>
    <li>Types and Frequency of Testing</li>
    <li>Packaging, Safety, Handling, Labeling, etc.</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm248234576">Many of these specifications also contain qualification requirements or call out another specification that covers qualification.  Qualifying a feedstock to a specification generally requires sampling a certain number of feedstock lots (often 3 or more) and testing them against the requirements in the specification.  If all of the lots pass, then a feedstock supplier will be considered qualified.  Additionally, each lot of material that is produced will be individually qualified to meet the specification.  A powder lot that passes the qualification tests, can then be certified to meet the specification, as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm237481040">Each company and industry has its own approach to who can be qualified against a feedstock specification.  Industries that produce more critical hardware (aerospace, medical) will often only qualify the factory/plant where the feedstock is made from a precursor (monomer for polymers, bar stock for wire or powder, etc.).  For critical parts, the facility that produces the precursor and its precursors (e.g. ingot or sponge for titanium powder) may need to be qualified.  In other industries and applications, a distributor (facility that procures feedstock and re-sells to users) may be qualified.</p>

  <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm249363904">Common practice in manufacturing is to develop and stabilize a process on a single machine or cell, and then to transition the process to additional machines or facilities as the production rate increases.  Similarly, process or product development may be done using the feedstock from a single supplier, and then qualify additional sources as they are needed.  While the qualification of additional facilities and personnel are often identical to that for an initial facility or operator, a range of options for machines and feedstock sources exists.</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm235758512">The simplest and lowest-cost method of qualifying an additional feedstock source is to perform the same qualification tests (3 lots, etc) that were done for the original source.  In some cases, however, the engineering authority may want to expand upon that qualification, which would include the building and testing of hardware.  This may be driven by the criticality of the part.  Another reason, especially in an emerging industry like AM, is to ensure that what is nominally the same feedstock from a different source also performs the same in processing.  The extent of this additional qualification can range from building and testing and IQ test part, to one or more OQ builds and testing, to repeating the qualification testing for each part.</p>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm250777952">Like additional feedstock sources, there is a broad range for qualification of additional machines.  This range is also highly influenced by the similarity of the additional machines to the initial machines, which can range from:</p>
<ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm225958320">
    <li>Identical – Same model number with exact same hardware, firmware, and software</li>
    <li>Very Similar – Same model number but slight differences in hardware, firmware, or software that do not influence the operation of the machine.  Examples of this would be a larger spool for filament, or different software for uploading the build log file to memory.</li>
    <li>Similar – Same model number but differences in hardware, firmware, or software that could influence the operation of the machine.  Examples of this would be a larger heater tip for improved thermal stability, or a redesigned galvanometer that has higher reliability.</li>
    <li>Not Similar – Same model number but differences in hardware, firmware, or software that will influence the operation of the machine.  Examples of this would be a different laser, process control software, etc.</li>
    <li>Different Machine – Different model number and design.</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm237584096">While all of the machines would receive a full IQ, OQ or PQ could range from a full repeat of the OQ for the first machine (definite for a different machine, with a demonstration of equivalent material property values and scatter), to something abbreviated, such as a single build and a check of the material properties against the specification (Identical or Very Similar).  Likewise, part qualification could range from full component and/or destructive testing (different machine) to first article testing without a destruct (similar or very similar) to part acceptance testing only (identical).  Additionally, the criticality of the part will play a role, with more critical parts requiring more intensive qualification. </p></section>

<p id="auto_b30bc42d-6683-4001-bd19-14c97c172200_fs-idm229906000">Everything thus far addressed in this chapter has gotten the AM part to the verge of production.  Once a part has been qualified, and the system on which part is installed is certified, production may now begin.  It should be noted that in some instances where certification can take a year or more, such as aircraft, parts may go into production before the aircraft is fully certified for delivery and use.   While parts are in production, they will undergo both lot and part acceptance tests to not only ensure that the parts meet requirements, but often that the feedstock and processes used to make them are in control.</p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_b30bc42d-6683-4001-bd19-14c97c172200_fs-idm205895696"><h3 data-type="title"> Lot Acceptance Testing</h3>
  <p id="auto_b30bc42d-6683-4001-bd19-14c97c172200_fs-idm249273584"><span data-type="term">Lot acceptance testing</span> refers to testing that is performed on a group (or lot) of parts to show that the processing the parts received meets specification.  There is a range of definitions for a lot in AM, such as:</p><ul id="auto_b30bc42d-6683-4001-bd19-14c97c172200_fs-idm229688624">
    <li>All of the parts in a single build in any process that go through key post-processing operations, such as thermal treatment, together.</li>
    <li>A series of parts in DED that use the same lot of feedstock, the chamber atmosphere is never broken, and go through key post-processing operations together.</li>
    <li>A series of parts in BJP that made in multiple consecutive builds, and undergo de-binding, sintering, and key post-processing operations together</li>
    <li>A series of parts in VP that use the same lot of resin and are made consecutively</li>
  </ul>
  <p id="auto_b30bc42d-6683-4001-bd19-14c97c172200_fs-idm210514048">Note that a lot could theoretically consist of identical, opposite-hand, similar, or even different parts.  What is being checked in lot acceptance is that the process met requirements.  Examples of what is tested for lot acceptance are:</p>
<ul id="auto_b30bc42d-6683-4001-bd19-14c97c172200_fs-idm205720304">
    <li>A check of the build file and process monitoring that there were no unacceptable process events, such as energy source failure, recoater failure, contaminated atmosphere, etc.</li>
    <li>A check of witness material in the build to verify that nominally acceptable material was produced.  These types of tests consist of mechanical (mainly tensile) tests, micrographic (mainly in metals) chemistry tests, etc.  Since AM builds parts in layers, careful thought must be put to the location of the witness coupons to ensure they are representative of the build process.</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_b30bc42d-6683-4001-bd19-14c97c172200_fs-idm217688752">As occasionally practiced in other industries, destructive lot acceptance testing is sometimes performed in AM.  This would be driven by a combination of part criticality, and overall maturity of the process.  Destructive lot acceptance testing would generally consist of selecting one or more parts from the lot and performing destructive testing on it, in a similar or less extensive manner than destructive part testing for qualification.  Different schemes may be used to select the part to be tested, with some requiring the same location in the lot, and others requiring a random location. </p>
<p id="auto_b30bc42d-6683-4001-bd19-14c97c172200_fs-idm225656288">Failure of one or more of these tests can result in the entire lot being rejected, require the need for additional testing to demonstrate lot or part acceptability, or being analyzed by engineering authority to determine if any of the parts are acceptable either as-is or with rework.</p>

<ul id="auto_b30bc42d-6683-4001-bd19-14c97c172200_fs-idm231624672">
    <li>Tensile properties of the witness coupons</li>
    <li>Key dimensions of the part</li>
    <li>Atmosphere gas consumption during build</li>
    <li>Laser output power</li>
    <li>Peak tip temperature in ME or peak current in an arc DED process</li>
  </ul>
<p id="auto_b30bc42d-6683-4001-bd19-14c97c172200_fs-idm218525040">Having an in-depth understanding of the key variables in the process can help a product team decide what inputs and outputs to monitor, with the default option being to monitor all and let advanced data analytics software to make that determination.  The former is preferred, as the latter can generate numerous false warnings (crying wolf) that distract the product team from other tasks.</p>

<p id="auto_4bf36fae-68bd-4816-b257-b13c3af4e5f3_fs-idm225735136">By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
<ul id="auto_4bf36fae-68bd-4816-b257-b13c3af4e5f3_fs-idm238800928">    <li>Understand the importance of a fixed process</li>
    <li>Understand the importance of having a disciplined change management process in AM</li>
  </ul></section>

<p id="auto_4bf36fae-68bd-4816-b257-b13c3af4e5f3_fs-idm235423856">The design, manufacture, and use of AM parts should follow fixed design, fixed (also known as locked down) process and change management protocols used in modern industrial practice.  This is in spite of the fact that by being a digital process that rarely requires tooling, it can be very easy from a practical standpoint to changes to either the design or the process.  In essence, once a design or process is fixed (or locked down), any changes to said design or process needs to be approved the cognizant engineering authority to ensure that the previously attained part qualification and system certifications are invalidated.</p>

<p id="auto_4bf36fae-68bd-4816-b257-b13c3af4e5f3_fs-idm229730160">The approach for change management is much like that used for qualification of additional machines.  Depending on the type of change, the amount of re-qualification can range from a minimal amount (first article testing without a destruct) to a full repeat of part qualification (design or process change) to repeat of machine and part qualification (process change).  Standard practice in organizations using AM is to initially require that all changes be brought to a change control board (CCB) to decide what requalification is necessary.  As the organization develops a history of change management, standard practices are then developed to more quickly determine and plan the re-qualification steps.  A good indication of the need for some form of requalification can be gained from reviewing the key process variables.  AMS 7003 (Laser Powder Bed Fusion Process) lists 34 key process variables.  A change in any of these could potentially trigger a requalification.</p>

<p id="auto_4bf36fae-68bd-4816-b257-b13c3af4e5f3_fs-idm235523648">Another type of change that can happen is maintenance or movement of the AM or post-processing machines.  In the case of a minor maintenance action machine could be nearly identical to itself before the maintenance, which would often just require a simple IQ.  In the case of a major maintenance action, the machine could be considered not similar, which would require IQ, OQ/PQ and part requalification.  This would be similar if the machine is moved to a different location.  In most cases, an IQ would be all that is required, unless the IQ fails, and a maintenance action is required.  Like design or product change management, the initial requalification requirements for maintenance actions have a high level of oversight until history and standard practices are developed.  In the case of intermittent production, or if a machine is idle for a period of time, some industries will require an IQ prior to resuming production, with a reduced OQ/PQ or part requalification potentially required as well.</p>

  </ul></section>

<p id="auto_0de6bd08-e881-4881-9bc6-1173a57460e1_fs-idm225948752">As a rapidly evolving technology, AM will continue to develop and mature.  Along with the general maturation of the technology, certification and qualification will continue to mature to evolve as well.  At this time, most organizations qualifying AM parts on systems that require certification are being very careful in their approaches.  The primary changes in the future for certification and qualification will be to streamline those processes.<a href="#auto_0de6bd08-e881-4881-9bc6-1173a57460e1_eip-idm378498480" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a></p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_0de6bd08-e881-4881-9bc6-1173a57460e1_eip-idm378498480">This is a footnote to test footnote functionality in this template, since there are neither footnotes nor references in the test manuscript.

<ul id="auto_0de6bd08-e881-4881-9bc6-1173a57460e1_fs-idm235577024">
    <li>A better understanding of material/process/property relationships that will enable a transition of design values from part-specific to part-family to feature-based.  Advances in Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) combined with advancements in process simulation and part design/analysis codes will give designers and analysts the ability to predict properties based on the part design.  While the design value tables may be multi-dimensional, versus the 2-dimensional format shown in Figure F06_01_7050, it can be imagined that these could be simplified if the potential performance impact of lower design values is minimal.</li>
    <li>Exploiting the same ICME advancements, develop the ability to more quickly generate design values as faster or more precise AM technologies are introduced.</li>
    <li>Transition NDT from post-build to in-situ and followed with the ability to repair during the build.  This capability, along with the ability to predict maximum undetectable defect size will enable better analysis of critical components.</li>
    <li>Improved knowledge of the performance of AM-unique geometries to reduce the amount of full-scale component and system testing.</li>
  </ul>

<p id="auto_0de6bd08-e881-4881-9bc6-1173a57460e1_fs-idm223082416">Changes in qualification will be based on obtaining a better understanding of the key process variables and the impact on part performance.  These changes will exhibit themselves as: </p>

<ul id="auto_0de6bd08-e881-4881-9bc6-1173a57460e1_fs-idm229680208">
    <li>A more extensive, but more automated IQ, that will be able to make a better determination of the status and health of a machine than is currently possible.</li>
    <li>A reduction in the number of builds and tests needed for OP or PQ, particularly due to improved IQ.</li>
    <li>Improved characterization and better definition of feedstock requirements to eliminate the need for any feedstock qualification save acceptance testing.</li>
    <li>Advances in process monitoring, process control, and in-situ NDT to eliminate the need for destructive testing for part qualification.</li>
    <li>Lot and part acceptance based on process monitoring and in-situ NDT of the build, along with process monitoring of key post-processes, such as thermal treatments.</li>
    <li>Integration of process monitoring with post-build evaluations as part of an integrated SPC program.</li>
