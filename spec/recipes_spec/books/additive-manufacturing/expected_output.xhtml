After an introductory chapter on computer science, the text introduces the essentials of computational thinking and builds on those in each unit. Students move through a thorough coverage of problem solving and algorithms into a unit on how algorithms are realized in the key areas of languages, computer systems, networks, and operating systems. The third unit focuses on designing and developing software solutions through programming, software applications and engineering, and data management. Unit IV explores various ways computer science technologies are used to solve business and social problems in today&#x2019;s world, including web-based, cloud-based, and hybrid solution models. The text closes with a chapter on society and information technology, including social media, cybersecurity and privacy, green computing, ethics, and careers in information technology. Brief appendixes provide historical context on computer science and data management, an overview of research methodology, and supporting instruction for using the text&#x2019;s companion playground environment for those instructors and students who would like supplemental content in these areas.

The <em data-effect="italics">Introduction to Computer Science</em> textbook will realize its vision through a practical approach that focuses on the conceptual capabilities computer science provides to help build technical solutions to business problems. Manual business or social solutions typically involve processes that are applied by people at one or more locations. For example, the selling of insurance policies used to be delegated solely to insurance agents who met with customers in order to issue quotes and bind policies. Computer science has helped automate and replace manual solutions to business problems via information systems composed of applications that create or manipulate data and operate on top of technical infrastructures. Most insurance companies today have sophisticated websites that act as insurance portals where customers can obtain quotes and insurance policies on their own. When teaching intricate technical topics (such as Computer Systems Organization) that students are approaching for the first time, being able to relate to practical solutions is important to ensure that students remain engaged in the classroom and are able to identify real-world opportunities where this knowledge can be applied.

          <p id="auto_5c1f0124-75ae-40e3-bd36-ff2bd10bbb6d_eip-448">Many introductory texts in this discipline do not provide a straightforward path across the various underlying areas that make up the field. <em data-effect="italics">Introduction to Computer Science</em> will stand out by looking at the various areas as conceptual capabilities or building blocks and assembling them as a sequence that empowers students with a clear vision of computer science at the start of their academic studies. This foundation will be paired with the practical and solution-based approach highlighted across the book via chapter scenarios, features showcasing real-world examples and issues, and assessments that ask students to apply computational thinking to relevant and relatable problems.
</p>
          <p id="auto_5c1f0124-75ae-40e3-bd36-ff2bd10bbb6d_eip-1000">It is also essential that the text integrate with other courses in computer science that students will take. These courses include (at the very least) Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Systems Organization, Operating Systems, Data Communications and Networks, Programming Languages, Database Systems, Software Engineering, Web Applications Development, Cloud Computing, and Society and Computer Science. Introduction to Computer Science will cover the material at a preliminary level so that students can gain additional knowledge as they take these more advanced courses. For non-majors, the resource will set the pace for a practical introduction to computer science that provides them with examples of how computational thinking can help them solve daily practical problems to prepare them for workforce experience. A goal of the book is that students&#x2014;both majors and non-majors&#x2014;will engage in activities and assessments that enable them to create artifacts of value that can be used to build career confidence. For example, learned skills should be relatable and translatable to opportunities with prospective employers and internship providers.</p>

Many of the core topics of an introductory computer science course will not change drastically over the next several years, but it is important that the resource be designed to evolve as technology progresses. For example, a transition to neuromorphic computing or quantum computing in the future could drastically affect topics such as Computer Systems Organization, Operating Systems, Data Communications, and Networks. However, progress in these upcoming areas is fairly slow and can be addressed through incremental changes via maintenance or mini updates. With faster evolution, the use of Machine Learning at various levels will keep growing and the material will need to address this evolution. It is likely that the material will be best taught in the future via a flipped classroom environment due to the growing variety of topics being covered and the need to work on practical problems with students to maximize their learning. A textbook structure that allows for regular mini updates, plus companion tools such as a playground environment, will facilitate a resource that is adaptable to evolving technologies as well as resulting shifts in how the material is taught.

        <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm371381904">The Systems Engineering V starts in the upper-left corner, where the user/customer/regulator states the requirements that the system must meet. &#xA0;In the case of a military aircraft, the user, customer, and regulator are the same, that being a country&#x2019;s air force. &#xA0;In the case of a civilian aircraft, they are different, where the user and customer are the same (airline) but the regulator is an airworthiness authority (FAA, EASA, etc.). &#xA0;In the case of a medical device, such as a hip implant, the user is the patient, the customer is the hospital, and the regulator is a medical agency (Food and Drug Administration, Public Health Division). &#xA0;In non-regulated industries, it can be even more complicated.</p>
        <ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm376953616">
          <li>In the offshore oil and gas industry has the oil company as the user, an oilfield equipment company as the customer, and a third-party reviewer, such as Lloyd&#x2019;s of London.</li>
          <li>In the case of an automobile company, while various government agencies have regulations regarding emissions, safety, and other aspects that provide basic requirements, the customer is the person who buys the car, and the head of marketing for the auto company essentially sets the system requirements to be something they can sell at sufficient profit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm371017232">It is typically the job of the Chief Engineer to integrate the different requirements into a successful design. &#xA0;In the case of civilian aircraft, it needs to be safe to meet the regulator&#x2019;s requirements, while also being efficient, reliable, and comfortable, to meet the airline&#x2019;s requirements. &#xA0;In the case of automotive, it needs to be efficient, comfortable, safe, and reliable, especially when one considers the cost of recalling and repairing a million vehicles.</p>
        <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm367407872">Once the overall system requirements are defined, it is then necessary to determine the requirements for the subsystem, followed by the individual components. &#xA0;This includes criticality (impact if the part fails), envelope, and reliability. &#xA0;With requirements established, components are then designed and analyzed. &#xA0;This marks the end of product definition and is followed by construction (building of parts and assemblies). &#xA0;The final phase is testing to verify that the part/subsystem/system meets requirements. &#xA0;This begins with part qualification, followed by sub-system testing, and finally system certification. &#xA0;In the case of system certification for civilian aircraft, this can include hundreds of flight tests, full-scale static and fatigue testing of the airframe, stand testing of the engine, along with analyses and simulations.</p>
        <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm378095968">Another aspect of certification that is especially applicable to a new manufacturing technology such as AM is known as but building block approach (Figure F06_01_bblock). &#xA0;When introducing a new material, manufacturing process, or both for either a new or existing system, development and certification proceeds in a series of building blocks, starting at the bottom in the following order:</p>
        <ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm378818928">
          <li>Selecting the material and process combinations that have the most promise to meet requirements</li>
          <li>Developing those materials and/or processes to lock them down and stabilize them</li>
          <li>Determining the design values</li>
          <li>Performing structural tests starting with small elements and joints, and moving to subcomponents</li>
          <li>Performing final component and system tests for qualification and certification</li>

          <h3 data-type="title">System-level Certification</h3>
          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm375308864">As the highest level of certification, system certification is the farthest removed from the manufacture of an AM part. &#xA0;As mentioned above, a large part of certification has to do with system tests (flight tests in the case of an aircraft, crash tests for automobiles), full-scale structural tests, subsystem tests, simulations, and software testing. &#xA0;When the AM part is either carrying load or necessary to operate, a test of the system or subsystem is necessary for system level certification. &#xA0;However, many parts in a system may not be fully loaded in a certification test. &#xA0;</p>
          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm370718352">Example: &#xA0;A bracket that attaches the overhead bins in an aircraft </p>
          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm372615968">The brackets are required to not fail and drop luggage on the passengers if the aircraft crash-lands. &#xA0;Mechanically, the bracket is expected to only be fully loaded once. &#xA0;Because of the difficulty and risk entailed to correctly perform such a test, that part of the certification is done by analysis. &#xA0;That is to say, the calculations related to the design, loads, and material properties are analyzed to show compliance with the requirements.</p>
          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm379596528">In the case of an AM part used in the overhead bins, we are concerned with analyzing two aspects: &#xA0;1) the design of the part itself and how it attaches to the surrounding structure, and 2) the strength of the AM material comprising the part. &#xA0;Because one of the benefits of AM is the ability to design parts of new, and more efficient geometries, additional structural analysis and verification may be necessary. &#xA0;This may require subsystem tests in a lab on the part of the overhead bin attachment hardware that includes the AM part. &#xA0;An example of a subsystem structural test for pipeline welds is shown in Figure F06_01_subsystem. &#xA0;The part would be tested to a load greater than would be encountered in such a crash landing. &#xA0;The other way in which the use of AM is involved in certification is the determination of the strength of the actual material of which the AM part is made, and how consistent those properties are. &#xA0;This will be discussed in a later section.</p>

          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm383106048">Unlike system certification, that may only happen a few times in the lifecycle of a product family (airplane type in the example above), part certifications happen hundreds, or even thousands of times, in a single year for a product. &#xA0;This certification, which is common across many industries and manufacturing processes, entails the manufacturer of a part or a subsystem certifying that the part or subsystem being delivered meets its technical requirements. &#xA0;In the case of an AM part shipped from the part maker to the system builder, a document known as a Certificate of Conformance is either provided with the hardware or delivered electronically to the system builder. &#xA0;This Certificate of Conformance states that the manufacture is not only certifying that the part meets dimensional requirements, but that it was manufactured in accordance with the appropriate process, using the appropriate feedstock, and has passed all other inspections, such as metallurgical, mechanical property, nondestructive testing, hardness, and any other requirements. &#xA0;An example of a part certification is shown in Figure F06_01_certific.</p>

          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm379593440">Another type of certification that takes place in AM is the certification of the operators of equipment. &#xA0;This is also not unique to AM, as many critical processes, such as welding, heat treatment, and composite part fabrication require certified operators. &#xA0;Operator certification usually requires a certain amount of classroom and on-the-job training, along with demonstrations of proficiency, such as written and practical (on-machine) examinations. &#xA0;Once an operator has demonstrated the necessary level of proficiency, they are then certified as operators, and allowed to produce production hardware on their own. &#xA0;These certifications are often tracked in a company&#x2019;s manufacturing resource planning (MRP) systems, that will only allow a certified operator to either initiate or electronically sign off a manufacturing operation.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Development of Design Values</h3>
          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm382048192">Key to certifying a system made from engineered materials is knowing the properties of those materials. &#xA0;If the stiffnesses of the materials are not known, then one cannot be confident of the load paths or the stresses in the parts. &#xA0;If the strength properties of the materials are not known, one cannot be confident that the parts will be able to withstand the loads or stresses they are subjected to. &#xA0;If the thermal properties of the materials are not known, one cannot be confident of the operating temperature of that part and the surrounding parts, and their ability to withstand the temperatures without static, fatigue, creep, or excessive oxidation failure. &#xA0;Thus, in order certify a system, it is necessary to know with confidence the properties of the materials that the parts are made from. &#xA0;This includes:</p>
          <ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm379735712">
            <li>Knowing the strength that a significant amount of the population of a material will have</li>
            <li>Knowing the physical properties of a material</li>
            <li>Understanding the relationships between material composition, processing, and strength</li>
            <li>Knowing the impact of environmental conditions on the material properties</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm370875888">The first of these often requires the development of what might be called &#x201C;minimum&#x201D; properties. &#xA0;They are minimum properties because it is a statistical characterization describing what can be expected to be achieve a very high percentage of the time, so therefore the process should always be able to deliver higher properties ensuring the part&#x2019;s success. &#xA0;One can imagine that if a design used median properties, it could be expected that as much as half of the parts used would have insufficient strength to meet service needs. &#xA0;In most industries, that would be considered a deficient design, and the system would not be certified. &#xA0;Therefore, many industries use minimum material properties in determining a design. &#xA0;Because knowing the true minimum properties of a material would require testing all of it, industries have developed methodologies for determining the minimum properties used for design. &#xA0;</p>
          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm378152752">One of the most widely used methods is the aerospace industry standard known as Metallic Materials Properties Development and Standardization (MMPDS), currently in its 14th version. &#xA0;The methods used in this standard have been developed over several decades with participation by the global aerospace industry and its regulators. &#xA0;It contains a chapter of over 200 pages that lays out the methodology, requirements, and the means of presenting the data. &#xA0;The types of Design Mechanical and Physical properties published in this are:</p>
          <ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm372365808">
            <li>A-Basis Values &#x2013; This is the value that 99% of the material will be stronger than with 95% confidence</li>
            <li>B-Basis Values &#x2013; This is the value that 90% of the material will be stronger than with 90% confidence</li>
            <li>S-Basis Values &#x2013; This is the minimum value that a specification will allow but does not have the statistical basis of A-Basis or B-Basis values.</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm381368608">The criticality of the part will often determine the need for A-Basis, B-Basis, or S-Basis values. &#xA0;Because there are no published design properties for AM metals in MMPDS, we will use examples from wrought metals to illustrate these properties. &#xA0;Figure F06_01_7050 contains the table of properties for 7050-T7451 aluminum alloy plate, made to the Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE) Aerospace Material Specification (AMS) 4050, while Figure F06_01_ti6al4v contains the table of properties for Annealed Ti-6Al-4V bar made to specification AMS 4911).</p>

          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm379603680">Note that the properties are different for different directions, illustrating that 7050-T7451, like most engineered materials, is anisotropic. &#xA0;It also has S-basis values for elongation. &#xA0;Finally note that the physical properties (moduli, Poisson&#x2019;s ratio, density, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and thermal expansion) provided are not minimum properties, but averages. &#xA0;This is because unlike strength properties, where bigger is better, and having a statistically derived minimum value provides design confidence; higher or lower physical properties may not be any better, hence the use of average properties. &#xA0;Note that in some very specialized applications, it may be necessary to have statistically based physical properties.</p>
          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm372523040">What is interesting in <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm379392672">Figure 1.8</a>, is that while A-Basis and B-Basis values are provided for most of the values, footnote b indicates that the A-Basis properties are actually a S-Basis values. &#xA0;This is because the specification minimum is 130ksi, and 120ksi for ultimate and yield tensile strength. &#xA0;Even though statistically the material has higher properties, it would be unwise to use those higher properties for design if the material is being accepted to a specification that allows lower-strength material.</p>
          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm382410272">What can also be seen in looking at <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm379392672">Figure 1.8</a> are that there are different sets of columns for different thicknesses. &#xA0;This partially addresses item 3) above, which is understanding material, processing, and property relationships. &#xA0;In the case of wrought aluminum alloy plate made to industry standards (which AMS 7050 requires), there is an inverse relationship between strength and thickness. &#xA0;Additionally, the temper designation of T7451, means that these properties are achieved in material that has received this specific thermo-mechanical treatment (solution annealed, quenched, stretched, and overaged). &#xA0;In the case of a developing technology like AM, the understanding of these variables is a work in progress.</p>
          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm369057088">While the over 200 pages in MMPDS lays out the methodology, requirements, and the means of presenting the data is well established for wrought materials, the methods for AM materials still being developed. &#xA0;One of the primary questions for AM is establishing the range of part geometries and processing parameters to include in a data set for determining the design values. &#xA0;Until such methods are standardized and validated, design authorities are independently developing methods. &#xA0;Depending on the circumstances, different approaches are being used, examples of which are:</p>
          <ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm370759840">
            <li>Part Specific Design Values &#x2013; This entails building a large number of the same part, excising test coupons from them, and deriving the properties based on the test results and applying the proper statistics</li>
            <li>Part Family Design Values &#x2013; This can be developed from the start or can be an extension of Part Specific Design Values. &#xA0;This entails building replicates of a number of parts that are closely related in terms of geometry and processing parameters, and deriving the properties based on the test results and statistics. &#xA0;If done as an extension of Part Specific Design Values, it would usually involve building and testing parts similar to the original one and verifying consistency of properties.</li>

          <p id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm372608032">While most of the properties of interest are mechanical and physical properties, in some cases, product-specific properties are required. &#xA0;Examples of these are:</p>
          <ul id="auto_e5fb88f2-d10b-4e32-9cb0-bf7363c3dda6_fs-idm380360592">

        <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm220611584">While more detailed definitions exist, for the purposes of this book, a defect is a discontinuity that may compromise the ability of a part to meet design intent. &#xA0;While it can be expected that the above industries will continue to use NDT for AM parts, the lack of long-term service history may cause other industries, such as automotive, to consider the use of NDT until manufacturing and service history provides the data needed to eliminate it. &#xA0;One unique aspect of AM is that since the parts are built in layers, the opportunity presents itself to inspect the part as it is built, known as In-Situ AM. &#xA0;Related to this is the ability to gather and analyze significant amounts of data while a part is being built, which provides unprecedented ability to perform Process Monitoring or Process Control while the part is being built.</p>
        <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm218554496">Post-build NDT, often referred to as conventional NDT, is divided into volumetric and surface methods. &#xA0;Volumetric methods look for discontinuities in the interior of a part or material, while surface methods look for discontinuities on the surface of a part. &#xA0;Each of these methods have their own attributes, with surface methods generally considered more critical. &#xA0;Surface discontinuities tend to have a greater impact on performance than subsurface ones due to higher stress concentrations and the potential for crevice corrosion. &#xA0;It can be imagined one day, that in-situ NDT of AM may address both volumetric and surface inspections. &#xA0;In the following paragraphs, each of the inspection technologies will be briefly described with relation to AM, followed by an example.</p>
        <section data-depth="1" id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm223616000">

          <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm234347056">While photographic film was the preferred detector until the 1980s, more and more industries are now using digital detectors to capture the image. &#xA0;These offer significant benefits in terms of time, sensitivity, and ability to analyze the image. &#xA0;The most sophisticated, and expensive, radiographic method is known as computed tomography (CT). &#xA0;In this method, the part is rotated while being continually exposed to the X-rays and the detector continually collects the data. &#xA0;The data is then processed to generate a 3D reconstruction of the part. &#xA0;In addition to being used to detect and characterize discontinuities, CT can also generate a solid model for comparison with the actual design. &#xA0;This extra capability can be quite useful in AM to determine if a complex part with internal passages meets dimensional requirements where conventional metrology would not be able to inspect.</p>

For the purposes of this book, we will say the discontinuities of interest are pores, inclusions, and cracks.  Additionally, it is necessary to know that the cooling passages are the correct distance from the surface of the part.  A series of radiographic shots, as shown below, could be used to look for pores and cracks, with a typical sensitivity being 2% of material thickness (thus if the part is 50mm thick, pores above 1mm across could be detected), and to provide some information on the cooling channels.  The use of CT, however, would provide the ability to determine the actual geometry of the cooling channels and allow a digital comparison with the original model the part was built to.  One aspect of AM where complexity can a hindrance is in performing radiographic inspections.  While the part in Figure F06_02_conform is relatively simple, parts with large number for small features can have lots of noise around the edges of the features, making it difficult to interpret the radiographic results.</span>

          <ul id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm249481328">
            <li>In the most common mode, called pulse-echo, the transducer, then listens for the pulse. &#xA0;If it reflects off an internal discontinuity, the size and location can then be inferred by looking at the signal. &#xA0;</li>
            <li>Another approach, called pitch-catch, uses a second transducer that listens for the signal reflecting off of the discontinuity. &#xA0;This can be a benefit over the first for some geometries. &#xA0;</li>

          <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm248184480"><a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_preform">Figure 1.15</a> shows a picture of a part that could potentially be ultrasonically inspected. &#xA0;In this case, it would be desirable to perform ultrasonic inspection to find a lack of fusion between the layers. &#xA0;This requires transmitting the sound in the directions shown by the red arrows. &#xA0;While the sound could be introduced into most of the part through the flat plate on the bottom, the angled geometry of the flange on the right, along it not being attached to the plate means that sound must be introduced at the top. &#xA0;Additionally, the rounded top of the features (called a crown) could prevent getting a good reflection when inspecting the majority of the part through the flat plate. &#xA0;Thus, it may be necessary to machine the crowns off of the top of the part to perform ultrasonic inspection.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title"> Eddy-Current Inspection</h3>
          <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm234930272">Eddy-current inspection is primarily a surface inspection method, although discontinuities within 1mm of the surface can be detected with the correct set-up. &#xA0;Eddy-current uses an electromagnetic coil (generally between 10Hz and 4Mhz, depending on material and application) to induce eddy-currents in the part. &#xA0;Thus, only conductive materials can be inspected. &#xA0;The presence of a physical discontinuity will disturb the eddy-currents, which is picked up the test equipment. &#xA0;Eddy-current testing requires a reasonably smooth surface, so the rough surfaces of AM parts can be a significant hinderance. &#xA0;It can also be very labor-intensive. &#xA0;As a result, it is often relegated to inspecting small areas, where a production discontinuity or fatigue crack is suspected.</p>
          <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm242540480">A good example of an eddy-current inspection is the bicycle frame shown in Figure 7. &#xA0;Because of the bionic design, there are few, if any, single load path areas. &#xA0;The exception is where it attaches to the rear wheels or the front wheel/handlebar area. &#xA0;It could be imagined that fatigue cracks could originate in these areas as a result of extensive mountain biking, or regular commuting in Amsterdam. &#xA0;An application of eddy-current would be to inspect in those areas after the completion of a race, or once a month in the commuter&#x2019;s case.</p>

          <ul id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm236538656">
            <li>Process Monitoring &#x2013; Monitoring the inputs and responses of a process while it is being performed to see that it is operating within limits.</li>
            <li>Process Control &#x2013; Using data from process monitoring to change the inputs to a process to keep it within desired limits.</li>
            <li>In-Situ NDT - Inspections performed while a part is being made using AM.</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm247513072">Because AM is an inherently digital process, and because the machines produce large amounts of data, Process Monitoring is the most widely applied of the three. &#xA0;Ideally, Process Monitoring is performed while the process is active, although it can be applied post-built as part of an accept/evaluate/reject decision tree. &#xA0;A wide range of process parameters can be monitored. &#xA0;These include input parameters (laser input power, recoater voltage, arc current, gas flow rate, etc.) or output parameters (melt puddle size, bed surface temperature, laser energy, etc.). &#xA0;The key is reliably determining how the parameters correlate with either an acceptable part, a rejectable part, or a suspect part that requires further evaluation, which is made more challenging in that the definition may be geometry dependent. &#xA0;Making this determination is being helped by the use of a range of data analytics and machine learning tools that are now available.</p>
          <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm240240560">Process Control will often use the same sensors and data as Process Monitoring. &#xA0;The difference is that the AM machine uses the results of the sensing and analysis to determine if a process is going out of the desired limits and makes changes to the input parameters to keep it within its desired limits. &#xA0;Needless to say, this must be done while the process is active so the changes can be made as part of a closed loop. &#xA0;While not as widely used as Process Monitoring, Process Control is beginning to appear on newer-generation AM machines with increasingly sophisticated sensors and analysis methods.</p>
          <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm222668944">Making parts without discontinuities is always the goal. &#xA0;Depending on the industry and the part requirements such as, the criticality of the part and the level of confidence in the process, NDT may still be required. &#xA0;In AM, the best time to perform this may be while the part is being built, either to achieve desired level of sensitivity and reliability, minimize NDT cost, or to avoid continuing to add value to a part that is not acceptable. &#xA0;In-Situ NDT may look very much like Process Monitoring and use the same sensors and analysis methods. &#xA0;The difference, however, is that the output of the analysis is a determination that a region of a part contains or does not contain an unacceptable discontinuity and its approximate size.</p>
          <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm234912720">The decision to use Process Monitoring, Process Control, In-Situ NDT, or Post-Build NDT or some combination of the four, and the methods to be used requires the input of a combination of disciplines and needs to be integrated into the overall design and build of the system as part of the overall certification of that system.</p>

          <p id="auto_b921573a-7c02-4d28-bf58-560195c9d4d8_fs-idm235716688">The final stage in integrating NDT with design and analysis is determining the effects of defects (EoD). &#xA0;That is, how do different discontinuities of different sizes impact the performance of a material. &#xA0;This type of testing is often done when a new material or process is introduced, or it is used for the first time in a new application, especially one that is loaded in fatigue or where damage tolerance is needed. &#xA0;EoD testing often requires:</p>

            <li>Building test parts with intentional discontinuities</li>
            <li>Performing NDT on the parts to see if the discontinuities are detectable and to characterize their apparent size</li>
            <li>Testing the parts to failure to see the impact on either the static strength, fatigue life, or fracture stress</li>
            <li>Correlating the size estimated by NDT, actual size, and impact on performance</li>
          </ul>

        <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm231503088">Like certification, qualification can apply to a wide variety of activities, ranging from a very high level (a factory is qualified to make AM hardware) to a very low level (a part is qualified for production). &#xA0;While each of these qualifications apply to different aspects of the producing of AM hardware, in the end, each of them points to the ability to repeatably make hardware that meets the engineering requirements and will perform as expected in service.</p>
        <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm232691408">A simple example of the relationship between certification and qualification would be the design of a rope swing, and the rope has to withstand a 10,000 N load. &#xA0;The engineer specifies a 10mm diameter nylon rope and hangs a 15,000 N weight from it (10,000 N x a safety factor of 1.5) from the rope as part of the certification process. &#xA0;Needing a reliable supply of rope, the rope swing company goes to a variety of rope manufacturers with a specification requiring 10mm diameter nylon rope that can withstand 15,000 N without failing. &#xA0;The rope manufacturers submit to the swing maker the results of tests on their 10mm ropes showing that their rope can withstand 15,000 N without failing. &#xA0;At this point, the swing maker qualifies several rope manufacturers as suppliers, and adds them to a qualified producer list (QPL). &#xA0;In brief terms:</p>
        <ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm215735424">
          <li>The swing maker certifies that their rope swing design is fit for service. &#xA0;The design that is certified specifies the kind of rope that can be used</li>
          <li>The swing maker qualifies rope manufacturers as suppliers of conforming rope</li>
          <li>A further take on this is that the rope manufacturers qualify suppliers of nylon strand that conforms to the rope manufacturer&#x2019;s specification to be used for making 10mm diameter rope.</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm219338112">The comparison with the AM industry is the system (airplane) builder is the swing maker, the rope manufacturer is the AM part maker, and the strand supplier is the powder production facility.</p>

            <li>Testing the optical train on a L-PBF machine by scanning the laser over the build area that has a series of detectors installed to measure beam profile, placement accuracy, consistency, and power.</li>
            <li>Translating the deposition head on a DED or ME machine over the full build volume to verify accuracy and repeatability over that volume.</li>
            <li>Measuring the protective gas flow on a machine to verify the lack of dead spots in coverage</li>

IQ, sometimes known as Site Acceptance Testing (SAT), almost always takes place at the user&#x2019;s facility, after the machine has been received, installed, and re-assembled. &#xA0;In the case of machines that are only assembled at the user&#x2019;s facility, IQ and FAT may be performed simultaneously to reduce time and cost. &#xA0; In many cases, the first stage of IQ is repeating all of the FAT testing to ensure that the newly re-assembled machine performs the same as it did at the factory. &#xA0;A SAT may include the FAT initially but then increase in scope to the user&#x2019;s definition if they possess or add capability to the standard machine and thus becomes the default condition for the user which is then different than the original factory.</p>

          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm249545200">The requirements for OQ are generally found in the specification used by the part customer to procure production hardware. &#xA0;While in most cases, the specification used for OQ are proprietary to the part customer, the general push is to move to industry-standard specifications. &#xA0;Examples of this are AWS D20.1 (Specification for Fabrication of Metal Components using Additive Manufacturing) and AMS 7032 (Additive Manufacturing Machine Qualification). &#xA0;The specification will either include or reference a specification that contains the full range of qualification tests, along with the relevant pass/fail criteria.</p>
          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm227671136">OQ will use the feedstock intended for production, as the end result is the approval to use the machine to make production hardware to a specification that includes the feedstock and final part material. &#xA0;Feedstock from a qualified source (covered in 6.2.5) is also generally required. &#xA0;Full post-processing may need to be performed to properly perform certain tests like chemistry, microstructure, and mechanical properties. &#xA0;These will also need to be performed by post-processors who have the necessary approvals from the part customer or 3rd party.</p>
          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm248223248">Because the objective of OQ is to demonstrate that the machine and feedstock combination are capable of repeatably making hardware that conforms to specification, the following are often part of an OQ:</p>

Qualification Volume is the portion of the build volume qualified to make the specified hardware. </p>

          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm205595520">While prototyping, risk reduction, and pre-production development for a part may be performed prior to machine qualification, part qualification may only take place on a machine that has been qualified, except in instances where the engineering authority allows simultaneous machine and part qualification. &#xA0;In part qualification, the user is demonstrating that the combination of the feedstock, machine, general build process (as documented in the PCD), and the part-unique processes produces a part that not only conforms to the general part specification, but also to the Engineering requirements for the part. &#xA0;This part qualification can consist of 3 to 5 activities:</p>
          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm246505648">Build File and Build &#x2013; After the qualification part or parts are built, the log file for that build, like the builds for OQ, are reviewed and analyzed for any anomalies that would normally have caused the build to be halted or the parts rejected.</p>
          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm230058336">Engineering Lot and Part Acceptance &#x2013; Once the build has been deemed to be acceptable, the qualification part or parts are subjected to the post-processing, lot acceptance testing (chemistry, witness tensile coupons, etc.) and part acceptance testing (dimensional and NDT). &#xA0;In the case where final part machining would prevent destructive coupon testing, that post-processing may be omitted.</p>
          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm219545840">First Article Testing &#x2013; In the general case, first article testing refers to any testing that is performed on a first article or articles that would not be performed on production articles. &#xA0;For the purposes of this, it will refer to additional dimensional and NDT. &#xA0;Examples of first article testing are:</p>
          <ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm243685184">
            <li>While part acceptance testing may require dimensional inspection of key interface and other critical dimensions, first article testing may consist of making a 3-D point cloud of the whole part and comparing it to the model. &#xA0;This could also include detailed surface roughness measurements.</li>
            <li>While part acceptance may require film radiographic inspection of the part, first article testing may also include CT scanning the part. &#xA0;This can also be used to generate a part model to compare to the Engineering model.</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm214813168">Destructive Testing &#x2013; As has been practiced in the forging and casting industries for decades, or even centuries, one or more of the first articles may be destructively tested. &#xA0;Examples of this type of testing are:</p>
          <ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm236603840">
            <li>Excising mechanical test coupons from the part to verify that the mechanical properties of the material in the part meets specification requirements. &#xA0;In most cases, the only requirement is to meet specification minimums, but for parts that are critical or have low design margins, it may be required that sufficient coupons may be tested to compare the mean values and property scatter. &#xA0;Depending on the part and the number of coupons needed, it may be necessary to destructively test multiple parts. &#xA0;Additionally, the properties of the coupons excised from the part should be compared with any witness mechanical test coupons used for lot acceptance. &#xA0;This is shown in Figure F06_02_witness. &#xA0;In this example, two parts were destructively tested, with 6 X-direction, 2 Y-direction, and 4 Z-direction coupons excised from the parts. &#xA0;In addition, 2 X-direction and 2-Z-direction tests were performed from the lot witness coupon. &#xA0;In the case of this data set, it can be seen that the all of the tensile values are higher than the specification minimum, and the UTS and YS values are higher than the Design Value Population Mean. &#xA0;While the number of tests are too small for a true statistical comparison, it is apparent that the part properties are consistent or better than the Design Value Population. &#xA0;Finally, the values from the part are higher than those from the witness coupon, which indicates that the witness coupon will provide an early indicator if the process drifts out of control and the overall properties get lower.</li>

              <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm227746992">The challenge of digital connectivity may start with the data that one might be trying to capture but increasingly there is a disconnect between how long it takes to acquire the data and the window of time that the information is relevant or actionable. We will get into this in more detail throughout the discussions within Additive Manufacturing with examples on how individual errors in a build layer may disqualify an entire 20 hour build. In conventional manufacturing similar gaps persists, especially as it refers to quality assurance. Presumably most organizations have some quality metrics in place to ensure that the parts that are being produced fulfill the customer requirements. Most of these metric systems are able to pick out an individual part or batch of parts that are out of spec once the full part is built. Digital tools based on the machine can now identify problems earlier on in the part manufacturing process. Signal irregularities or even electrical disturbances can be gleaned from mundane machine sensors and relayed back to computer systems that aim to keep a long term cumulative view of the machine performance. </p>

In fact, unlocking the data that will help critical operations optimizing will be a competitive advantage that cannot be overlooked. </p>

            <li>Apprentice &#x2013; Able to operate equipment under supervision of a Journeyman or Master. &#xA0;Generally, not qualified for critical parts.</li>
            <li>Journeyman &#x2013; Able to operate equipment without supervision. &#xA0;May supervise apprentices. &#xA0;Could be qualified for critical parts.</li>
            <li>Master &#x2013; Able to operate equipment without supervision and supervise apprentices. &#xA0;Qualified for critical parts. &#xA0;Responsible for other aspects of an AM facility, such as approving build files, signing off on maintenance, administering qualification of Apprentices and Journeymen.</li>

          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm233693776">Without feedstock that reliably meets specification, any manufacturing process will be hard-pressed to repeatably produce hardware that meets requirements, hence the need to qualify feedstock. &#xA0;The use of a qualified feedstock is almost always a requirement for OQ, Part Qualification, or PQ. &#xA0;The specification the covers printing and processing the AM parts will generally require the use of feedstock qualified to a specification. &#xA0;ASTM and SAE (AMS Series) are issuing a series of feedstock specifications for many of the commonly used powders, wires, and filaments. &#xA0;Where a public specification does not exist, or where different controls are needed, organization will issue their own proprietary specifications. &#xA0;Feedstock specifications contain requirements for items such as:</p>
          <ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm218257184">

          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm237481040">Each company and industry has its own approach to who can be qualified against a feedstock specification. &#xA0;Industries that produce more critical hardware (aerospace, medical) will often only qualify the factory/plant where the feedstock is made from a precursor (monomer for polymers, bar stock for wire or powder, etc.). &#xA0;For critical parts, the facility that produces the precursor and its precursors (e.g. ingot or sponge for titanium powder) may need to be qualified. &#xA0;In other industries and applications, a distributor (facility that procures feedstock and re-sells to users) may be qualified.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title"> Qualification of Additional Facilities, Machines, Personnel, and Feedstock Sources</h3>
          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm249363904">Common practice in manufacturing is to develop and stabilize a process on a single machine or cell, and then to transition the process to additional machines or facilities as the production rate increases. &#xA0;Similarly, process or product development may be done using the feedstock from a single supplier, and then qualify additional sources as they are needed. &#xA0;While the qualification of additional facilities and personnel are often identical to that for an initial facility or operator, a range of options for machines and feedstock sources exists.</p>
          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm235758512">The simplest and lowest-cost method of qualifying an additional feedstock source is to perform the same qualification tests (3 lots, etc) that were done for the original source. &#xA0;In some cases, however, the engineering authority may want to expand upon that qualification, which would include the building and testing of hardware. &#xA0;This may be driven by the criticality of the part. &#xA0;Another reason, especially in an emerging industry like AM, is to ensure that what is nominally the same feedstock from a different source also performs the same in processing. &#xA0;The extent of this additional qualification can range from building and testing and IQ test part, to one or more OQ builds and testing, to repeating the qualification testing for each part.</p>
          <p id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm250777952">Like additional feedstock sources, there is a broad range for qualification of additional machines. &#xA0;This range is also highly influenced by the similarity of the additional machines to the initial machines, which can range from:</p>
          <ul id="auto_0a69d485-1d16-44d5-a25f-ac48f0148106_fs-idm225958320">
            <li>Identical &#x2013; Same model number with exact same hardware, firmware, and software</li>
            <li>Very Similar &#x2013; Same model number but slight differences in hardware, firmware, or software that do not influence the operation of the machine. &#xA0;Examples of this would be a larger spool for filament, or different software for uploading the build log file to memory.</li>
            <li>Similar &#x2013; Same model number but differences in hardware, firmware, or software that could influence the operation of the machine. &#xA0;Examples of this would be a larger heater tip for improved thermal stability, or a redesigned galvanometer that has higher reliability.</li>
            <li>Not Similar &#x2013; Same model number but differences in hardware, firmware, or software that will influence the operation of the machine. &#xA0;Examples of this would be a different laser, process control software, etc.</li>
            <li>Different Machine &#x2013; Different model number and design.</li>

            <li>A check of witness material in the build to verify that nominally acceptable material was produced. &#xA0;These types of tests consist of mechanical (mainly tensile) tests, micrographic (mainly in metals) chemistry tests, etc. &#xA0;Since AM builds parts in layers, careful thought must be put to the location of the witness coupons to ensure they are representative of the build process.</li>

          <p id="auto_b30bc42d-6683-4001-bd19-14c97c172200_fs-idm232961184">Modern quality management systems will often utilize statistical process control (SPC), sometimes referred to as statistical quality control (SQC). &#xA0;SPC consist of recording data from either the process or the product and checking it against limits to determine if a process is in control. &#xA0;The goal is to use this tracking to get advance warning that a process is getting out of control before it happens and begins making unacceptable hardware. &#xA0;As a digital and data-rich technology, AM is ideally suited for this. &#xA0;Examples of process variables and outputs that could be tracked are:</p>
          <ul id="auto_b30bc42d-6683-4001-bd19-14c97c172200_fs-idm231624672">

        <p id="auto_4bf36fae-68bd-4816-b257-b13c3af4e5f3_fs-idm235423856">The design, manufacture, and use of AM parts should follow fixed design, fixed (also known as locked down) process and change management protocols used in modern industrial practice. &#xA0;This is in spite of the fact that by being a digital process that rarely requires tooling, it can be very easy from a practical standpoint to changes to either the design or the process. &#xA0;In essence, once a design or process is fixed (or locked down), any changes to said design or process needs to be approved the cognizant engineering authority to ensure that the previously attained part qualification and system certifications are invalidated.</p>
        <p id="auto_4bf36fae-68bd-4816-b257-b13c3af4e5f3_fs-idm229730160">The approach for change management is much like that used for qualification of additional machines. &#xA0;Depending on the type of change, the amount of re-qualification can range from a minimal amount (first article testing without a destruct) to a full repeat of part qualification (design or process change) to repeat of machine and part qualification (process change). &#xA0;Standard practice in organizations using AM is to initially require that all changes be brought to a change control board (CCB) to decide what requalification is necessary. &#xA0;As the organization develops a history of change management, standard practices are then developed to more quickly determine and plan the re-qualification steps. &#xA0;A good indication of the need for some form of requalification can be gained from reviewing the key process variables. &#xA0;AMS 7003 (Laser Powder Bed Fusion Process) lists 34 key process variables. &#xA0;A change in any of these could potentially trigger a requalification.</p>
        <p id="auto_4bf36fae-68bd-4816-b257-b13c3af4e5f3_fs-idm235523648">Another type of change that can happen is maintenance or movement of the AM or post-processing machines. &#xA0;In the case of a minor maintenance action machine could be nearly identical to itself before the maintenance, which would often just require a simple IQ. &#xA0;In the case of a major maintenance action, the machine could be considered not similar, which would require IQ, OQ/PQ and part requalification. &#xA0;This would be similar if the machine is moved to a different location. &#xA0;In most cases, an IQ would be all that is required, unless the IQ fails, and a maintenance action is required. &#xA0;Like design or product change management, the initial requalification requirements for maintenance actions have a high level of oversight until history and standard practices are developed. &#xA0;In the case of intermittent production, or if a machine is idle for a period of time, some industries will require an IQ prior to resuming production, with a reduced OQ/PQ or part requalification potentially required as well.</p>
