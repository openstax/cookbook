        <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00045/index.cnxml:71:9">Preparing for College Success</em> is designed to meet the needs of college preparation courses for high school students. Because a college preparation course may vary greatly from school to school or district to district, this high school edition has
        been developed to provide the most flexibility possible for course coordinators and teachers. The open license and multiple formats provide many
        opportunities to tailor the material to meet classroom or program-specific needs.</p>

        Success Concise</em>, addresses the evolving challenges and opportunities of today's
        diverse students. The intensive development work leveraged expertise from hundreds of FYE
        coordinators and faculty across the country. In particular, this high school version was crafted
        with the input of high school teachers who have offered a course on preparing students to apply and go to college after graduation. The topics
        have been carefully chosen to prioritize the most critical topics in helping students prepare for the expectations and opportunities of college, and the authors have organized them to create a logical and reinforcing flow.
        While the content mirrors the <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00045/index.cnxml:81:39">College Success Concise</em> book, this version includes a chapter on researching the best options after high school and applying to college.
        Users will see distinctive additions in certain areas, such as a new
        section on group work and greatly expanded coverage of stress, social media, and wellbeing. All of this content provides high school teachers the opportunity to prepare their students to research postsecondary pathways and make an informed decision about where to attend. This high school edition also gives students an introduction to the mindsets, behaviors, habits, and strategies they need to be successful throughout their entire college career.</p>

JT had no idea that he would be looking at almost $20,000 a year, or over $80,000 for the entire degree. He had not saved anywhere near enough to cover the costs of his degree.</p>

The grants and scholarships will be based on qualifications and need, so they are not guaranteed.</p>

You will experience so many new things when you get there. As a freshman in college, my best advice is to put yourself out there. When you are finally on your own, you will feel homesick, but please explore campus clubs, go to sporting events, attend guest appearances, etc. Also, talk to your professors and advisors. They are incredibly helpful and want the best for you. It’s okay if you don’t have a major chosen yet because many freshmen don’t know either. Go to class and study as much as you can. Remember this is not high school; therefore, the rules are different, but it’s better because you are now an adult and can do whatever you want! The most important thing to remember is that you are responsible for your grades now, and you no longer have your parents to tell you to stay on top of things. That’s your job now, so please stay on top of yourself because it’s very easy to slip up and start failing a class. Enjoy your first year and have fun!"</p>

Will you be able to balance your high school work and activities with the process of applying to college? Will you find a school that you want to go to? Will you be able to afford it? Will you make new friends and feel comfortable there? How far away from home will you be and will a new community feel welcoming? All of the thoughts and the accompanying emotions will come and go as you move through high school and towards making a decision as to what you want to do after earning a diploma.

However, there are more rewards for going to college than just these long-term gains. In fact, you may have already identified a few that are motivating you to consider college: You get to study topics and develop skills that interest you; you get to live on your own (or with a roommate); and you get to have more control over what you do and when you do it. These are all good reasons to go to college, but there are other ways that college can benefit you.</p>

Its purpose, instead, is to help you “become a learner.” Sanders points out that learning to learn while taking a variety of required courses will help you develop the very skills that will help you reach your long-term goals and adapt to the changing world of work after you graduate.</p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_640660d4-d0c2-409a-b5e0-61fb2f5ff9fb_foot-00001" data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:34:96">Sanders, M.

In other words, college will give you the chance to challenge and ultimately strengthen your values and beliefs, develop an awareness of who you are and what you want, embrace and learn from adversity, and demonstrate integrity and work ethic. College is not the only place for you to grow in these ways, but it is specially designed to allow you to do so with minimal repercussions.</p>

Experts in student development theory believe that your early adult years (ages 18-23) are the optimal time to determine your values, beliefs, and goals–or at least work through the options and learn more about what you like and don’t like. Two researchers developed a theory about the ways in which students in college develop. Arthur W. Chickering and Linda Reisser (1993) published their theory of identity development<a href="#auto_640660d4-d0c2-409a-b5e0-61fb2f5ff9fb_foot-00002" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a> for young adults. While it sounds mysterious, plainly stated, it is a theory about how and in what capacity you will grow and change while in college. The following seven components, or “vectors,” of the theory can provide you with a preview of what you will experience:</p><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_640660d4-d0c2-409a-b5e0-61fb2f5ff9fb_foot-00002" data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:117:564"> Chickering, A.

In some cases, you may have to take 10 or more courses in a variety of areas (or disciplines). These courses are often referred to as “general education courses,” but other names include “core courses,” or “liberal arts courses.” Each higher education institution is different in how many and what courses they require. You may have to take courses in writing, mathematics, sciences, arts, humanities, and social and behavioral sciences such as psychology or sociology. These courses may seem to stand in your way of learning about topics that directly relate to a major, but they are important to helping you develop yourself as a learner and build competence in your skills. When you register for classes once you are admitted to college, view your first academic terms as an opportunity to explore different topics and push yourself outside your comfort zone. You don’t know why taking a biology class will help you if you are a business major? Recall the section above about becoming a learner: adopting a “learner” mindset can help you frame the experience productively. Instead of feeling disconnected from such a course when your major is something different, think about how scientists, and their ways of thinking, provide us with ways in which to improve our health and environment. Or think of taking these courses that are not aligned with your major as opportunities to develop a broad range of learning and thinking skills that you will rely on for the rest of your life. At the very least, you will be a stronger learner and at the most, you may discover that what you really love to learn is something you had never considered studying before.</p>

These reasons don’t change much when you go to college. Most institutions offer a wide variety of clubs, organizations, societies, and Greek fraternities and sororities for the same reasons: to help students develop socially, personally, and professionally. Once you determine where you are going and what you will be studying, you will also want to take the time to decide how, what, where, and when you want to get involved. There is a balance, of course, and you don’t want to be so involved socially that you forget to go to class! Instead, look for organizations that fit your interests and find out what the commitment level is. Some will be very casual, meeting only once a semester or only for social interaction. Others will be more involved and may even cost a considerable amount of money each term (e.g., fraternities and sororities). Even before you choose an institution to attend, check out their list of opportunities to get involved. Then, when you make your choice, make a goal of exploring your options further. Here are some things to consider:</p>

You will most likely find many clubs and organizations that serve as social gatherings, usually organized around an interest or hobby. A film appreciation club, for example, could be a great way to meet people and enjoy something you like to do, like watching movies.</li>
      <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:138:7"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:138:13">Exploring your values and beliefs</strong>. Most college campuses have faith-based or politically-affiliated groups that give you the chance to connect with others who share your values. Consider pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone, however, and look for groups that also provide a different perspective.</li>
      <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:139:7"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:139:13">Developing leadership skills</strong>. One of the benefits of participating in clubs and organizations is that you can have the chance to develop key leadership skills. Most groups need a leader or several to carry out their missions. Student government associations or councils or advisory boards are great ways to get involved in significant ways.</li>
      <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:140:7"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:140:13">Staying physically active</strong>.

You may have already had some experiences with stumbling academically or personally up to this point. While it seems cruel to suggest that there will be more of these negative experiences in your future, being prepared for disappointments can help you prepare for them. The first setback you may experience with college is not getting into your dream school or getting in, but not being able to afford it, is too far for you to go, or it does not have the major you want. One way to handle these obstacles successfully is to consider the following:</p>

      <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:149:7">How you handle yourself–your attitude, your emotions, and your reaction–is key in staying focused on bouncing back. You can’t always control what happens to you, but you can control how you react when it does.</li>
      <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:150:7">Sometimes you may need to ask for help. Some setbacks, such as a failing grade on a test in college, may indicate that you need someone to show you how to study more effectively. Use the experience to assess what kind of help you need and then ask for it.</li>
      <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:151:7">View the failure as a learning experience. If you don’t get what you want, then ask yourself “What can I learn from this?”</li>

It is clear that what you do (or don’t do) in high school can affect your ability to get into the colleges of your choice, but there is more to preparing yourself than just earning a high GPA or class rank. Your high school education can provide you with ample opportunity to help you hone your academic skills.</p>

Why? Because those classes can help lay a foundation of high expectations and hard work <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00047/index.cnxml:30:237">and</em> they are often highly regarded by college admissions counselors. These classes are sometimes called Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), or honors/advanced classes. If you are considering taking such courses, talk to your guidance counselor or current teachers. They may be able to offer suggestions for how to get selected (if there is an application process) and give you a realistic picture of what will be expected. There is no need to take all AP, IB, or advanced classes to prove you are ready for college, but taking a few can provide a college admissions committee evidence that you are open to challenge.</p>

If you already use a planner to track what you need to <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00047/index.cnxml:34:242">do</em> and when it is <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00047/index.cnxml:34:298">due</em>, then you are on the right track. You can enhance these skills by setting reminders for yourself–and not relying on teachers or parents to tell you when to complete or submit an assignment. The most important part of managing your time and tasks effectively is to build in time well before something is due to complete the work and to overestimate (at least initially) how long you need, which can provide time “buffers” that will keep you from rushing through work to finish it.</p>

You don’t have to wait until college, though, to figure out how best to learn different subject matters. This is one reason you should consider taking challenging classes–they require that you put more time and effort in them to learn the material. And those skills will make transitioning to college <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00047/index.cnxml:38:429">much</em> easier. How can you “learn to learn”? You may have little control over what you are learning and how you are tested, but you can control how you approach the learning. One way to learn how to learn is to space out your learning over time (as best as you can–sometimes teachers like to give you a pop quiz when you least expect it!). Reviewing a bit of material for a short amount of time over several days (as opposed to cramming it in right before a test) produces better results. Another way to learn how to learn is to monitor how well your learning strategies work. Did you do well on a test? Take some time to reflect on what you did that resulted in a good grade. Did you space out your studying? Did you look for connections in the material? Likewise, if you do poorly on a test, determine what led to the result. The more you can identify what works and doesn’t for you, the easier it is to make improvements in your learning strategies.</p>

It can be easy to put off homework and studying, not do it at all, or cut corners to complete the work. While you may be able to get away with some stumbles like forgetting to turn in an assignment, other behaviors, such as getting someone (including Artificial Intelligence software) to do your homework or write a paper for you can get you into trouble. Now is the time to build the skills you will need later in college. Taking full responsibility for your learning as well as demonstrating integrity <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00047/index.cnxml:42:603">in all assignments no matter how big or small</em> are the foundation of those skills. How do you do this? For one, you acknowledge that every action or inaction will produce a result. If you put in the work to write the paper, you will earn the grade you receive. If you do not put in the work or find a way to shortcut the process by using someone else’s writing, then you have missed an opportunity to improve your writing, your thinking, and your project management skills. Plus, you may get into trouble for academic dishonesty, which could mean failing an assignment or a course, or getting a more substantial punishment, such as expulsion. The stakes only get higher when you are in college. </p>

Definitely do all you can to raise your test scores through practicing, prepping, and doing your best on the day of the test. But do not assume that a low test score will be the end of your long-term goals or educational journey. They are just one piece of information by which an institution may evaluate your potential, but it shouldn’t be the only thing that tells who you are.</p>

To that end, you may want to draw upon those unique characteristics as you begin to shape the story that you will share with college admissions staff and scholarship committees. Will you be the first in your family to go to college? Do you live on a working farm and feed the goats, cows, and horses every morning before school? Can you ride a unicycle or juggle or both? There may be both personal characteristics as well as experiences that make you stand out from others, and if there are, consider weaving these details into the tapestry of your story. Start by making a list of your characteristics–no trait is too small or typical at this point. You can eliminate items later when you start building your story, but for now, create the list and add to it as you think of new things that you are or can do.</p>

For some students, this prompt is difficult for they have either not experienced a life-changing setback or not considered themselves challenged. It is important to remember that <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00047/index.cnxml:58:335">any</em> setback or disappointment–no matter how inconsequential it may seem to you–can be the basis for an essay that responds to such a prompt. There is no need to embellish the circumstance if it is truly not harrowing, but it is acceptable to frame the experience as something that was difficult for you. Most readers of essays are less looking for a made-for-Hollywood story and more wanting to see someone who has demonstrated tenacity, resilience, and reflection no matter how big or small the adversity is. Even if you are not required to write an essay on a time in your life in which you failed or experienced disappointment, having a story handy for interviews (for scholarships, internships, or jobs) can help you share insight into your personality and strengths in a succinct way.</p>

Each institution is unique because of its mission, its student population, programs of study, and opportunities for getting involved. Some students want to go to a college with a high-profile sports team while others want to live and study in a specific city or area of the country. To help you determine your best fit for a college or university, you will want to spend some time creating questions to ask yourself, your family, your guidance counselor, and campus representatives. With these questions in hand, you can start gathering more detailed information about the schools that you may want to attend. Here are just a few additional areas or characteristics that you will want to consider as you do your research.</p>

For example, if it is important for you to attend a religiously-affiliated or religiously-focused institution, reviewing the mission of the university will help you determine if the institution is a good fit for you. Some mission statements reflect a teaching focus, which means that faculty value teaching and learning and may offer a rich in-class experience for students; some mission statements reflect a research focus, which means that faculty place a greater value on their research projects, which may offer a unique experience for students who are interested in participating in the development of knowledge. Questions to ask: <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:107:803">What is the mission of the institutions that you are considering? How do you think the mission will affect your experience at the institution?</em></p>

Therefore, it is important to know how well a school does when it comes to graduation rates. There are many reasons that students may not graduate–some decide college is not the path they want to take, some transfer to another school, and others find that putting a pause on their studies makes more sense for them. A high graduation rate (60% or higher) usually indicates that there are many opportunities to stay on track and graduate within four or five years. More and more institutions are providing additional support to students so that they can graduate, so it is worth asking what measures they have in place to help. Questions to ask: <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:111:782">What are the institution’s four-year and six-year graduation rates? What support systems does the institution have in place to help students who struggle to graduate on time?</em></p>

Each institution’s costs of attendance will differ based on tuition, fees, room, and board (also known as “meals”), but many also estimate the costs of transportation and books and supplies. For public institutions, be sure to look at the in-state costs versus the out-of-state costs. If you attend a public school within your state, the tuition and fees should be lower than if someone from out of state were to attend. Tuition, fees, room, and board are institutional costs and will be paid directly to the school you attend. The personal costs are ones that you will be responsible for are variable, which means they will depend on your circumstances. For example, you may not have substantial transportation costs if you are going to a school in your hometown.</p>

However, it does provide you with a realistic starting point as you do more research on where you may want to attend. The table below shows an example of the cost of attendance at an in-state university for an undergraduate student living on campus. </p>

For example, if you want to be a cybersecurity expert, you will want to look for programs that provide a major if not specific coursework that would prepare you for this career. Not all institutions will have a direct pathway to certain, specialized careers, so doing your homework by reviewing their list of majors will help you narrow down your options.

A student who goes to an urban, diverse, and large high school that attracts students from different countries may find a small, rural liberal arts college in the middle of the country less diverse while another student with a different high school experience may find the same school much more diverse. There is more to diversity than race and ethnicity although that is one measure. If you are looking to live and learn amongst a wide variety of people, review the demographic data (usually on the college’s website), but also look at the faculty and staff demographic data as well as the types of clubs, events, and organizations that are available to students.

Larger institutions located in metropolitan areas don’t always have more opportunities. Instead of assuming that size matters when it comes to student involvement, consider how the colleges and universities that you are researching address the student need to develop leadership, work within the community, network with alumni, and offer partner programs with other institutions. You may, for example, choose a college that has a strong internship program that can place you directly into the field or company where you want to work after graduation. Questions to ask: <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:185:845">What unique opportunities to get involved or connected does your institution offer? How can a student make the most of the involvement opportunities that are available?</em></p>

The same may be said about colleges and universities. For some students, the where is as important as the what. You want to eventually work in government and politics? An institution close to Washington, D.C., may be a good choice for you. You want to work in the film industry? An institution with ties to Hollywood may be the best fit. Want to enjoy outdoor activities such as snow skiing, hiking, and rock climbing? An institution in Colorado or Utah may address your needs. For some students, moving to a different part of the country or even a different country–far away from friends and family–is exciting. For others, they want or need to choose a college that is close to home or within commuting distance. Thus, when you start to research your college options, make location an explicit part of the discussion. There could be added costs to moving across the country or it may affect your ability to come back home over holiday breaks as well as out-of-state tuition and fees. Factor in the logistics of getting there (and back) and the costs before you make your final decision. Questions to ask: <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:189:1333">How many of your students are at least 50 miles away from home? Do students stay on campus over the weekends and during breaks or do they head home?</em></p>

      <p id="auto_0a10f321-762f-4b9d-b2b5-5ef9c8a7dbd9_para-00019" data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:206:7">Once you make a list of what is important to you and you start exploring the many options you have, it is time to consider a campus visit. The institution may offer a student preview day in which they invite high school juniors and seniors on campus to take tours and learn more about their programs and amenities, or you may be part of a group or a class that takes a field trip to local institutions to explore what they have to offer. Regardless of the occasion, there are some things to consider that will help you make the most of the visit. The more you can plan ahead–if you have the ability–for the visit, the more likely you will come away with valuable information. Consider the following when visiting:</p>
      <ul id="auto_0a10f321-762f-4b9d-b2b5-5ef9c8a7dbd9_list-00004" data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:207:7">
        <li data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:208:9"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:208:15">Time of year.</strong> When you visit is important. If you visit on a holiday break or during the summer, you may not get an accurate feel for the campus community. Try to visit during a fall, winter, or spring term to get a sense of how busy the college is.</li>
        <li data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:209:9"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:209:15">First impressions.</strong> What you feel when you first arrive–for good or bad–can influence how you feel about the entire visit. First impressions go a long way.</li>
        <li data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:210:9"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:210:15">Are people friendly and helpful?</strong> Is it easy to navigate the campus? Can you see yourself living and learning there?</li>
        <li data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:211:9"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:211:15">Class atmosphere.</strong> If there is an option to sit in a class, consider doing it. You will get a feel for how students interact with faculty and what kinds of learning they are involved in. Don’t be intimidated if the content or discussion seems complicated. By the time you are sitting in the same seat, you will be prepared.</li>
        <li data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:212:9"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:212:15">Faculty/student viewpoints.</strong> Some campus visits include talks from faculty and students. Colleges often choose well-spoken and positive representatives who can provide you with a sense of what it is like to be a student. Be sure to ask about challenges that students often face and what supports are available for those in need of help.</li>
        <li data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:213:9"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:213:15">Amenities.</strong> Chances are good that you will visit a typical residential hall room and eat a meal in the dining hall. These experiences are designed to give you a good idea of what it feels like to live on campus. You may also get a chance to tour other special amenities such as fitness facilities, grassy lawns, or hiking pathways. Take it all in as part of the atmosphere of the campus.</li>
        <li data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:214:9"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:214:15">Campus resources.</strong> Any good tour of campus should include visits to key campus resources. Does the institution have a health center, tutoring lab, library facility, office of accessibility resources? All of these support sources will be essential to your success in and out of the classroom, so be sure to check them out.</li>
        <li data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:215:9"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:215:15">Neighborhood.</strong> After you take a walk around campus, circle the block. Where is the campus located? Is it easy to access public transportation or friendly to walkers and cyclists? Do you feel safe and comfortable? If you have questions about navigating the area around the school, talk to students and staff about your concerns and ask for advice.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="auto_0a10f321-762f-4b9d-b2b5-5ef9c8a7dbd9_para-00020" data-sm="./modules/m00048/index.cnxml:217:7">If you are unable to visit a campus in person, you may be able to do a “virtual” visit by scheduling a conference call with admissions counselors, financial aid staff, faculty, and students. Some institutions provide webinars in which you can learn more about the campus culture and ask questions of the speakers. Even if you have to check out video, interactive maps, and social media, you may be able to get a good idea of what the experience and opportunities can be for you. You have so many ways to explore colleges and universities without having to set foot on the lawn, so be sure to take advantage of all that you can do to learn more.</p>

You may even consider creating a resume that lists your personal information along with your activities, leadership positions, and awards. While not all applications require a formal resume, creating one can help you capture what you have been doing over the past four years and help you stay organized. Because you may be applying for scholarships, grants, college admissions, and even internships or other selective programs, it will be important to maintain a list of not only what you have accomplished, but also what you have gained from those experiences. Consider creating a table, such as <a href="#auto_41f39aed-2ea4-457c-8269-a273518ed7cd_table-00002" data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:37:738" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> below, to help you capture your achievements as well as the effect they have had on you.</p>

They also include your high school GPA (at the time) as well as your class rank. Colleges will need your official transcript prior to admitting you. Oftentimes, your high school guidance counselor submits your transcripts on your behalf and usually before your final semester in high school is complete. Thus, colleges will be judging you for admissions and scholarships based on your 9th, 10th, 11th, and part of 12th grade work. When you request that your transcripts be sent to colleges and universities be sure to build in enough time for the transcript to get there, double check the correct address of the registrar’s office at the campus, and be sure you are requesting an official transcript, which may be sealed or stamped to guarantee its authenticity. Even though you will likely be admitted to college based on an incomplete high school transcript, your ability to enroll in classes will depend on your final, official transcript that will be sent after you graduate. Those last few weeks of the semester matter!</p>

This can be good news for students who feel that standardized test scores are not a true reflection on their abilities or potential. Taking the SAT or ACT may still provide you with an advantage when applying for college. Be sure, though, to read each institution’s policies and deadlines for submitting scores should you want them as part of your application package. In some cases, institutions that were test score optional for a few years may decide to return to requiring test scores.</p>

Even if the essay is considered optional, you are better off submitting one. A well-written, authentic essay can help the reader get to know you in ways that your list of accomplishments cannot. Think of the essay as the color and shape to a picture of who you are. There are many ways that you can approach the college essay, but here are some simple rules to follow to ensure that, at the very least, the essay is easy to read, clearly written, and a true representation of who you are:</p>
        <ul id="auto_41f39aed-2ea4-457c-8269-a273518ed7cd_list-00004" data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:70:9">
          <li data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:71:11"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:71:17">Read the prompt.</strong> And then probably read it again. Make sure you understand what the instructions are and you follow them completely.</li>
          <li data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:72:11"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:72:17">Note the word count.</strong> All essay prompts will include a maximum (and some cases a minimum) word count. The word count is used to help you focus and the fewer the words, the more you need to make each word count.</li>
          <li data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:73:11"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:73:17">Open with a hook.</strong> Your first few sentences should entice, or hook, the reader to continue reading. The reader of your essay will no doubt have read tens if not hundreds of essays and won’t spend much time on yours if it doesn’t grab them within the first few seconds of reading.</li>
          <li data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:74:11"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:74:17">Be specific.</strong> As writing professors often tell their students: Show, don’t tell. This means that you should provide vivid details. If you were disappointed that you didn’t make the soccer team, then write about the knot in your stomach and the red splotches on your cheeks when you realized you lost a chance to play your senior year.</li>

Most of the time, you can ask high school teachers if they would be willing to write you a good letter of recommendation. You may also consider asking adults who lead organizations that you have participated in. For example, a coach, youth group leader, or community service coordinator may be willing to write you a detailed letter that attests to your attitude and work ethic. When you ask for a recommendation, consider the following as ways to ensure that the letters are high quality and completed on time:</p>

This means that they know who you are and have observed your best characteristics. This will allow them to write a specific, detailed and positive letter.</li>
          <li data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:84:11"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:84:17">Ask someone you can rely on.</strong> Be sure that if you ask someone to write a letter of recommendation that you can rely on them to do so in a timely manner.</li>

Is it academic ability or leadership qualities? Be sure to give them specific guidelines especially if the application requires them to.</li>
          <li data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:87:11"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:87:17">Share all the details.</strong> Your letter writer will need to know what, when, where, and how to submit the letter. The more details, the more likely you will get the letter you need. For example, your letter writer may need to submit the recommendation on school letterhead and postmark it by a certain date. Or they may be required to submit an electronic evaluation of you that will be sent to their email address.</li>

Don’t ask to read the letter or keep a copy unless it is required as part of the application process. Some letter writers may want to share the recommendations with you or allow you to save a copy in case you need it for something else; of course, if the recommender suggests it and it does not violate a rule of the application process, you can do so.</li>
          <li data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:89:11"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:89:17">Show gratitude.</strong> Last but not least, when someone writes a letter of recommendation for you, provide a statement of thanks.

Applying to several schools can add up quickly. Some institutions offer fee waivers for low-income or first-generation college students, for example, or provide an “admission fee waiver” day when you can apply for no charge on a designated date. Talk to your guidance counselor or speak to an admissions officer at the institution to see if the schools you are applying to offer free or reduced fees.</p>

My freshman year I received some money in Pell-grants and financial aid, I didn't have scholarships because I hadn't applied because I thought that my grades in high school weren't good enough (NEWSFLASH: there are scholarships for more than just good grades). About 2 weeks before the start of the school year, I realized that I would have to pay $800 my first day and nearly $1,000 per month. And I sure did pay about $7,000 my freshman year of college, all earned from my two jobs. It was extremely hard, but I did it! I also learned about financial help that you could receive through the university without federal or private loans. My advice is before applying to a college consider the price and reach out to the university to see what more financial help you're eligible to receive. When making a decision whether to go to college, decide the primary area you want to go into career wise. College is beneficial but not for everyone. However, if you're considering going to college, but the stress of money or the amount of work is keeping you from applying, there are tons of things to help with those things on college campuses. I'm not going to lie, college is challenging but the experiences and knowledge that you could gain is worth it. If I can do it, anyone can!"</p>

      <p id="auto_41f39aed-2ea4-457c-8269-a273518ed7cd_para-00018" data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:103:7">You may feel relieved when you submit all your application materials and ready to wait for the offers to roll in. But the process has just started. You will soon need to review your acceptances (in addition to waitlists and rejections) to determine what the institution requires you to do to move forward. Typically, May 1 is considered “National Decision Day,” so you may find that you have only a few weeks to determine your next steps. This section provides an overview of the multiple considerations you will need to make before you can start classes as a college student.</p>
      <section data-depth="2" id="auto_41f39aed-2ea4-457c-8269-a273518ed7cd_sect-00013" data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:104:7"><h4 data-type="title" data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:105:9">Determining Next Steps</h4>

Because of the exponential increase in the number of students applying to multiple colleges, more and more institutions are placing qualified applicants on waitlists, or a list of applicants that may be admitted if students who have been accepted decline their spot in the next college class. In some cases, applicants are not waitlisted exactly, but are granted admission that is contingent on their first attending another school such as a community college and transferring in.</p>
        <ul id="auto_41f39aed-2ea4-457c-8269-a273518ed7cd_list-00006" data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:107:9">
          <li data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:108:11"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:108:17">Accepted.</strong> Review all the information regarding deadlines for accepting admission, financial aid, and housing (if you are living on campus). You will need to formally accept the offer of admission and may need to pay a deposit to secure residential housing.</li>
          <li data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:109:11"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:109:17">Waitlisted.</strong> Determine where you are on the waitlist (some institutions provide you with your number on the list) and how likely you would be to accept admission should you get off the waitlist. If you don’t want to attend the school, be sure to let the institution know to take you off the waitlist. There are no hard and fast rules about being waitlisted and it is nearly impossible to predict if you will get a chance to be admitted eventually. Your chances may increase after May 1 and the closer you get to the start of classes. At some point, however, you may want to move on.</li>
          <li data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:110:11"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:110:17">Offered Delayed Enrollment.</strong> This option is becoming more common as a way for institutions to increase student enrollment at times, usually the second and third years, when students often leave. Review the length of the delay as it could be one semester, one year, or two years as well as the requirements that will guarantee that you are eventually accepted. Do you need to enroll at any other institution or a satellite campus? Do you need to earn a certain number of credit hours and GPA? </li>
          <li data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:111:11"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00049/index.cnxml:111:17">Rejected.</strong> Even if you are rejected, you will want to ensure that you have read all the information about what you may be able to do should you want to reapply. Some institutions allow prospective students to appeal their rejection, but require them to complete the appeal by a certain date. The student may also have to write a statement as to why they are appealing the rejection as well as specific documentation such as a letter of recommendation.</li>

Once you get an acceptance letter, you will also be given a financial aid package to review. This will contain the information about scholarships, grants, loans, and other methods of paying your bill and provide you with a more realistic picture of what you will owe. The table below shows the net price, or the price you will likely pay, after you calculate the financial aid that you will receive. Institutions that may seem out of reach because of high tuition and fees may actually be your most affordable option because of the amount of scholarship and grant aid that they offer. Before you make any decisions, carefully review both the total estimated costs as well as the total estimated financial aid that you are offered.</p>

Do they have the major that you are most interested in? Or do they have enough options that you feel you can find something that will fit your long-term plans? If you have been accepted to multiple institutions, you will want to review your notes and impressions on many different aspects of the experience, but subjects you can study will most likely be an important part of your decision. Reach back out to professors, advisors, or students to ask for clarification if you have any lingering questions.</p>

For sure, you will need to submit a final transcript after you graduate; you may also need to provide test scores or updated test scores if you need them before registering for courses; you may need to register for advising and orientation; and you may also need to choose a housing option, select a roommate, and pay a deposit for housing or a fee for summer events. You will most likely not have to pay your bill until you get much closer to the beginning of the semester. Nonetheless, be sure you are aware of the upcoming deadlines for completing important tasks including paying for college.</p>

If you had hoped to attend a specific school and are not able to, take some time to reflect on the experience, talk with friends and family about how you feel, and focus on the pathways that are open to you. You will find a way forward and it may be better than you could have imagined.</p>

You still have the opportunity to make a change up until classes start. This is not to say that there may not be consequences when you change your mind at the last minute, but you do have the power to go in a different direction. In the few months between graduation and starting your first year of college, you may experience a change of heart or your family situation may change drastically. If something influences your decision in this way, always reach out to the institution first to talk through your options as soon as possible. In some cases, you may need to drop classes and officially unenroll or cancel housing. You can then use the steps outlined above to start the process anew.</p>

They all live in a small community and help each other out when needed. They don’t see why JT wants to go to college even if it means he could get a job that he really enjoys and makes him money. They are afraid he will change, maybe even not want to maintain a relationship with them, and they have been very vocal about their lack of support.</p>

He then asks his family if he could move in with them while he goes to college so he can save some of the money he earns to pay for his expenses. They, too, refuse to help him because they think he would be burdening them.</p>
