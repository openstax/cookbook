The grants and scholarships will be based on qualifications and need, so they are not guaranteed.</p>

You will experience so many new things when you get there. As a freshman in college, my best advice is to put yourself out there. When you are finally on your own, you will feel homesick, but please explore campus clubs, go to sporting events, attend guest appearances, etc. Also, talk to your professors and advisors. They are incredibly helpful and want the best for you. It&#x2019;s okay if you don&#x2019;t have a major chosen yet because many freshmen don&#x2019;t know either. Go to class and study as much as you can. Remember this is not high school; therefore, the rules are different, but it&#x2019;s better because you are now an adult and can do whatever you want! The most important thing to remember is that you are responsible for your grades now, and you no longer have your parents to tell you to stay on top of things. That&#x2019;s your job now, so please stay on top of yourself because it&#x2019;s very easy to slip up and start failing a class. Enjoy your first year and have fun!"</p>

Will you be able to balance your high school work and activities with the process of applying to college? Will you find a school that you want to go to? Will you be able to afford it? Will you make new friends and feel comfortable there? How far away from home will you be and will a new community feel welcoming? All of the thoughts and the accompanying emotions will come and go as you move through high school and towards making a decision as to what you want to do after earning a diploma. Be assured that you can complete the requirements for getting through high school and plan for setting yourself on the pathway to what we can &#x201C;postsecondary&#x201D; education, or the training program or college that you attend after you complete the 12th grade or earn a general education diploma (GED).</p>

However, there are more rewards for going to college than just these long-term gains. In fact, you may have already identified a few that are motivating you to consider college: You get to study topics and develop skills that interest you; you get to live on your own (or with a roommate); and you get to have more control over what you do and when you do it. These are all good reasons to go to college, but there are other ways that college can benefit you.</p>

Its purpose, instead, is to help you &#x201C;become a learner.&#x201D; Sanders points out that learning to learn while taking a variety of required courses will help you develop the very skills that will help you reach your long-term goals and adapt to the changing world of work after you graduate.</p>

In other words, college will give you the chance to challenge and ultimately strengthen your values and beliefs, develop an awareness of who you are and what you want, embrace and learn from adversity, and demonstrate integrity and work ethic. College is not the only place for you to grow in these ways, but it is specially designed to allow you to do so with minimal repercussions.</p>

Two researchers developed a theory about the ways in which students in college develop. Arthur W. Chickering and Linda Reisser (1993) published their theory of identity development for young adults. While it sounds mysterious, plainly stated, it is a theory about how and in what capacity you will grow and change while in college.

In some cases, you may have to take 10 or more courses in a variety of areas (or disciplines). These courses are often referred to as &#x201C;general education courses,&#x201D; but other names include &#x201C;core courses,&#x201D; or &#x201C;liberal arts courses.&#x201D; Each higher education institution is different in how many and what courses they require. You may have to take courses in writing, mathematics, sciences, arts, humanities, and social and behavioral sciences such as psychology or sociology. These courses may seem to stand in your way of learning about topics that directly relate to a major, but they are important to helping you develop yourself as a learner and build competence in your skills. When you register for classes once you are admitted to college, view your first academic terms as an opportunity to explore different topics and push yourself outside your comfort zone. You don&#x2019;t know why taking a biology class will help you if you are a business major? Recall the section above about becoming a learner: adopting a &#x201C;learner&#x201D; mindset can help you frame the experience productively. Instead of feeling disconnected from such a course when your major is something different, think about how scientists, and their ways of thinking, provide us with ways in which to improve our health and environment. Or think of taking these courses that are not aligned with your major as opportunities to develop a broad range of learning and thinking skills that you will rely on for the rest of your life. At the very least, you will be a stronger learner and at the most, you may discover that what you really love to learn is something you had never considered studying before.</p>

          <p id="auto_640660d4-d0c2-409a-b5e0-61fb2f5ff9fb_para-00010" data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:135:5">During high school, you may have participated in school activities and organizations for the social aspect, for the opportunity to effect a chance and serve the community, or for the ability to develop important skills. These reasons don&#x2019;t change much when you go to college. Most institutions offer a wide variety of clubs, organizations, societies, and Greek fraternities and sororities for the same reasons: to help students develop socially, personally, and professionally. Once you determine where you are going and what you will be studying, you will also want to take the time to decide how, what, where, and when you want to get involved. There is a balance, of course, and you don&#x2019;t want to be so involved socially that you forget to go to class! Instead, look for organizations that fit your interests and find out what the commitment level is. Some will be very casual, meeting only once a semester or only for social interaction. Others will be more involved and may even cost a considerable amount of money each term (e.g., fraternities and sororities). Even before you choose an institution to attend, check out their list of opportunities to get involved. Then, when you make your choice, make a goal of exploring your options further. Here are some things to consider:</p>

            <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:137:7"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:137:13">Making friends</strong>. You will most likely find many clubs and organizations that serve as social gatherings, usually organized around an interest or hobby. A film appreciation club, for example, could be a great way to meet people and enjoy something you like to do, like watching movies.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:138:7"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:138:13">Exploring your values and beliefs</strong>. Most college campuses have faith-based or politically-affiliated groups that give you the chance to connect with others who share your values. Consider pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone, however, and look for groups that also provide a different perspective.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:139:7"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:139:13">Developing leadership skills</strong>. One of the benefits of participating in clubs and organizations is that you can have the chance to develop key leadership skills. Most groups need a leader or several to carry out their missions. Student government associations or councils or advisory boards are great ways to get involved in significant ways.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:140:7"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:140:13">Staying physically active</strong>. A climbing or hiking club or intramural sports are great ways to incorporate physical activity into your life. If you want to learn a new skill or sport (pickleball, anyone?), these are good ways to try them out. </li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:141:7"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:141:13">Improving communication and project management skills</strong>. Any group you join will most likely have an event they put on or participate in, and your involvement will allow you to grow as a person in meaningful ways and help you develop career skills.</li>

          <p id="auto_640660d4-d0c2-409a-b5e0-61fb2f5ff9fb_para-00011" data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:146:5">You will read more about how to deal with adversity throughout the rest of the chapters of this book, but it is worth mentioning here how setbacks and failures can help you to learn and grow. You may have already had some experiences with stumbling academically or personally up to this point. While it seems cruel to suggest that there will be more of these negative experiences in your future, being prepared for disappointments can help you prepare for them. The first setback you may experience with college is not getting into your dream school or getting in, but not being able to afford it, is too far for you to go, or it does not have the major you want. One way to handle these obstacles successfully is to consider the following:</p>
          <ul id="auto_640660d4-d0c2-409a-b5e0-61fb2f5ff9fb_list-00004" data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:147:5">
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:148:7">Recognize that everyone slips up, makes mistakes, and fails before, during, and after college. It is normal and not fatal. You can and will recover.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:149:7">How you handle yourself&#x2013;your attitude, your emotions, and your reaction&#x2013;is key in staying focused on bouncing back. You can&#x2019;t always control what happens to you, but you can control how you react when it does.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:150:7">Sometimes you may need to ask for help. Some setbacks, such as a failing grade on a test in college, may indicate that you need someone to show you how to study more effectively. Use the experience to assess what kind of help you need and then ask for it.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:151:7">View the failure as a learning experience. If you don&#x2019;t get what you want, then ask yourself &#x201C;What can I learn from this?&#x201D;</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_640660d4-d0c2-409a-b5e0-61fb2f5ff9fb_para-00012" data-sm="./modules/m00046/index.cnxml:153:5">Experiencing a failure, setback, obstacle, or disappointment should not derail you from your goal, but it can help you rethink your approach and give you information about what is not working or what you can do differently the next time.</p>

      I wish I had known the reality of how much college costs and the resources needed to meet those demands. My freshman year I received some money in Pell-grants and financial aid, I didn't have scholarships because I hadn't applied because I thought that my grades in high school weren't good enough (NEWSFLASH: there are scholarships for more than just good grades). About 2 weeks before the start of the school year, I realized that I would have to pay $800 my first day and nearly $1,000 per month. And I sure did pay about $7,000 my freshman year of college, all earned from my two jobs. It was extremely hard, but I did it! I also learned about financial help that you could receive through the university without federal or private loans. My advice is before applying to a college consider the price and reach out to the university to see what more financial help you're eligible to receive. When making a decision whether to go to college, decide the primary area you want to go into career wise. College is beneficial but not for everyone. However, if you're considering going to college, but the stress of money or the amount of work is keeping you from applying, there are tons of things to help with those things on college campuses. I'm not going to lie, college is challenging but the experiences and knowledge that you could gain is worth it. If I can do it, anyone can! &#x2013;Lulu Leon, sophomore

He then asks his family if he could move in with them while he goes to college so he can save some of the money he earns to pay for his expenses.

As someone accepted on full funding to a 4-year university, but whose life&#x2019;s circumstances disallowed attending college until years later, I used to dream of a stress-free college life. The reality is, college can be a meaningful place, but it can also be challenging and unpredictable. The key is to <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00001/index.cnxml:41:421">be your own best advocate</em>, because no one else is obliged to advocate on your behalf.</p>

Cybersecurity was my passion, but I had no understanding of how credits transfer over to a 4-year university. This came to haunt me later, after I navigated the complex processes of transferring between two different colleges. Not everyone involved volunteers information. It is up to you, the student, to be the squeaky wheel so you can get the grease. Visit office hours, make appointments, and schedule meetings with stakeholders so that you are not just buried under the sheaf of papers on someone&#x2019;s desk.&#x201D;</p>

It has been a dream in the making, as he was unable to attend immediately after high school graduation. Instead, he worked several years in his family&#x2019;s business, got married, had a son, and then decided that he didn&#x2019;t want to spend the rest of his life regretting that he didn&#x2019;t get a chance to follow his dreams of becoming a teacher. Because it has been almost a decade since he sat in a classroom, he is worried about how he will fit in as an adult learner returning to college. Will his classmates think he is too old? Will his professors think he is not ready for the challenges of college work? Will his family get tired of his long nights at the library and his new priorities? There is so much Reginald is unsure of, yet he knows it&#x2019;s a step in the right direction.</p>

She graduated in the top 10 percent of her class, and she earned college credit while in high school. She feels academically prepared, and she has a good sense of what degree she wants to earn. Since Madison was 5 years old, she&#x2019;s wanted to be an engineer because she loved building things in the backyard with her father&#x2019;s tools. He always encouraged her to follow her dreams, and her whole family has been supportive of her hobbies and interests. However, Madison is concerned that her choice of major will keep her from dance, creative writing, and other passions. Furthermore, Madison is heading to a distant college with no other people she knows. Will she be able to find new friends quickly? Will her engineering classes crush her or motivate her to complete college? Will she be able to explore other interests? Madison has a lot on her mind, but she aims to face these challenges head-on.</p>

They are both committed to this new chapter in their lives, and they are both connected to their families in ways that can influence their commitment to this pursuit. What they don&#x2019;t know just yet&#x2014;because they haven&#x2019;t started their classes&#x2014;is that they will have even more in common as they move through each term, focus on a major, and plan for life after graduation. And they have a lot in common with you as well because you are in a similar position&#x2014;starting the next chapter of the rest of your life.</p>

This is an important first step because knowing your <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00001/index.cnxml:70:172">why</em> will keep you motivated. Next, the chapter will cover the transitions that you may experience as a new college student. Then, the chapter will focus on how you can acclimate to the culture and meet the expectations&#x2014;all of which will make the transition to a full-fledged college student easier. Adopting a learning mindset is covered next and will provide you with research-based information that can help you develop the beliefs and habits that will result in success. Finally, the chapter will provide you with strategies for overcoming the challenges that you may face by providing information about how to find and access resources.</p>

You are making a <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00002/index.cnxml:31:142">choice</em> to commit several years of hard work to earn a degree or credential. In some cases, you may have had to work really hard to get to this point by getting good grades and test scores in high school and earning money to pay for tuition and fees and other expenses. Now you have more at stake and a clearer path to achieving your goals, but you still need to be able to answer the question.</p>
          <p id="auto_97af6b57-0004-4218-99c1-f2cfedea8f30_para-00004" data-sm="./modules/m00002/index.cnxml:32:5">To help answer this question, consider the following questioning technique called &#x201C;The Five Whys&#x201D; that was originally created by Sakichi Toyoda, a Japanese inventor, whose strategy was used by the Toyota Motor Company to find the underlying cause of a problem. While your decision to go to college is not a problem, the exercise is helpful to uncover your underlying purpose for enrolling in college.</p>
          <p id="auto_97af6b57-0004-4218-99c1-f2cfedea8f30_para-00005" data-sm="./modules/m00002/index.cnxml:33:5">The process starts with a &#x201C;Why&#x201D; question that you want to know the answer to. Then, the next four &#x201C;Why&#x201D; questions use a portion of the previous answer to help you dig further into the answer to the original question. Here is an example of &#x201C;The Five Whys,&#x201D; with the first question as &#x201C;Why are you in college?&#x201D; The answers and their connection to the next &#x201C;Why&#x201D; questions have been underlined so you can see how the process works.</p>

In fact, if you are undecided, then you can explore the &#x201C;why&#x201D; of your indecision. For example, you may consider the following &#x201C;Why&#x201D; questions: Is it because you have lots of choices, or is it because you are not sure what you really want out of college?</p>

Had she not been instructed to delve a little deeper with each answer, it is likely that she would not have so quickly articulated that deeper purpose. And that understanding of &#x201C;why&#x201D; you are in college&#x2014;beyond the degree you want or the job you envision after graduation&#x2014;is key to staying motivated through what will most likely be some challenging times.</p>

There is no doubt you know people who have succeeded in a career without going to college. Famous examples of college dropouts include Bill Gates (the cofounder and CEO of Microsoft) and Ellen DeGeneres (comedian, actor, and television producer, among her many other roles).</p>
          <p id="auto_97af6b57-0004-4218-99c1-f2cfedea8f30_para-00011" data-sm="./modules/m00002/index.cnxml:94:5">These are two well-known, smart, talented people who have had tremendous success on a global scale. They are also not the typical profile of a student who doesn&#x2019;t finish a degree. For many students, especially those who are first-generation college students, a college degree helps them follow a career pathway and create a life that would not have been possible without the credential. Even in this time of rapid change in all kinds of fields, including technology and education, a college degree is still worth it for many people.</p>

As you can see, the more education you receive, the greater the increase in your average lifetime earnings. Even though a degree costs a considerable amount of money on the front end, if you think about it as an investment in your future, you can see that college graduates receive a substantial return on their investment. To put it into more concrete terms, let&#x2019;s say you spend $100,000 for a four-year degree (<em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00002/index.cnxml:95:536">Don&#x2019;t faint! That is the average sticker cost of a four-year degree at a public university if you include tuition, fees, room, and board</em>). The return on investment (ROI) over a lifetime, according to the information in the figure below, is 1,500%! You don&#x2019;t have to be a financial wizard to recognize that a 1,500% return is fantastic.</p>

Even if you have all your expenses covered, there is still an adjustment to a new way of thinking about what college costs and how to pay for it. You may find that you think twice about spending money on entertainment or that you have improved your skills in finding discounted textbooks.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00003/index.cnxml:33:5"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00003/index.cnxml:33:11">Intellectual adjustment</strong>. Experiencing an intellectual &#x201C;a-ha!&#x201D; moment is one of the most rewarding parts of college, right up there with moving across the graduation stage with a degree in hand. Prepare to be surprised when you stumble across a fascinating subject or find that a class discussion changes your life. At the very least, through your academic work, you will learn to think differently about the world around you and your place in it.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00003/index.cnxml:34:5"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00003/index.cnxml:34:11">Social adjustment</strong>. A new place often equals new people. But in college, those new relationships can have even more meaning. Getting to know professors not only can help you learn more in your classes, but it can also help you figure out what career pathway you want to take and how to get desired internships and jobs. Learning to reduce conflicts during group work or when living with others helps build essential workplace and life skills.</li>

It comes with its own language and customs, some of which can be confusing or confounding at first. Just like traveling to a foreign country, it is best if you prepare by learning what words mean and what you are expected to say and do in certain situations.</p>
          <p id="auto_2f839849-945b-4c12-bb67-645b1dc7f0c0_para-00003" data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:31:5">Let&#x2019;s first start with the language you may encounter. In most cases, there will be words that you have heard before, but they may have different meanings in a college setting. Take, for instance, &#x201C;office hours.&#x201D; If you are not in college, you would think that it means the hours of a day that an office is open. If it is your dentist&#x2019;s office, it may mean Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. In college, &#x201C;office hours&#x201D; can refer to the specific hours a professor is in her office to meet with students, and those hours may be only a few each day: for example, Mondays and Wednesdays from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m.</p>

A syllabus is often called the &#x201C;contract of the course&#x201D; because it contains information about what to expect&#x2014;from the professor and the student. It is meant to be a roadmap for succeeding in the class. Understanding that office hours are for you to ask your professor questions and the syllabus is the guide for what you will be doing in the class can make a big difference in your transition to college.

Terms such as &#x201C;quad&#x201D; or &#x201C;union&#x201D; can denote a location or space for students. Then there may be terms such as &#x201C;TLC&#x201D; (The Learning Center, in this example) that designate a specific building or office. Describe a few of the new terms you have encountered so far and what they mean. If you are not sure, ask your professor or a fellow student to define it for you.</p>

For example, you may be familiar with what a high school teacher does, but do you know what a professor does? It certainly seems like they fulfill a very similar role as teachers in high school, but in college, professors&#x2019; roles are often much more diverse. In addition to teaching, they may also conduct research, mentor graduate students, write and review research articles, serve on and lead campus committees, serve in regional and national organizations in their disciplines, apply for and administer grants, advise students in their major, and serve as sponsors for student organizations. You can be assured that their days are far from routine. See the table below for just a few differences between high school teachers and college professors.</p>

You will rely on them to help you find internships, write letters of recommendation, nominate you for honors or awards, and serve as references for jobs. You can develop those relationships by participating in class, visiting during office hours, asking for assistance with coursework, requesting recommendations for courses and majors, and getting to know the professor&#x2019;s own academic interests. One way to think about the change in how your professors will relate to you is to think about the nature of relationships you have had growing up.

These relationships are important because they will allow you to expand your network, especially as it relates to your career. As stated earlier, developing relationships with faculty can provide you with more than just the benefits of a mentor. Faculty often review applications for on-campus jobs or university scholarships and awards; they also have connections with graduate programs, companies, and organizations. They may recommend you to colleagues or former classmates for internships and even jobs.</p>

Nonetheless, some students struggle at first because they don&#x2019;t know about these habits, behaviors, and strategies. But once they learn them, they are able to meet them with ease.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title" data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:163:5">Working Within the Hidden Curriculum</h3>
          <p id="auto_2f839849-945b-4c12-bb67-645b1dc7f0c0_para-00019" data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:164:5">The first step in dealing with the hidden curriculum is to recognize it and understand how it can influence your learning. After any specific situation has been identified, the next step is to figure out how to work around the circumstances to either take advantage of any benefits or to remove any roadblocks. Let&#x2019;s review some other ways that you may encounter the hidden curriculum.</p>
          <p id="auto_2f839849-945b-4c12-bb67-645b1dc7f0c0_para-00020" data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:165:5"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:165:27">Prevailing Opinions</strong>. Simply put, you are going to encounter instructors and learning activities that you sometimes agree with and sometimes do not. The key is to learn from them regardless. In either case, take ownership of your learning and even make an effort to learn about other perspectives, even if it is only for your own education on the matter. There is no better time to expose yourself to other opinions and philosophies than in college. In fact, many would say that this is a significant part of the college experience. With the right mindset, it is easy to view everything as a learning opportunity.</p>
          <p id="auto_2f839849-945b-4c12-bb67-645b1dc7f0c0_para-00021" data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:166:5"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:166:27">Classroom Circumstances.</strong> These kinds of circumstances often require a more structured approach to turn the situation to your advantage, but they also usually have the most obvious solutions. In a large class, you might find yourself limited in the ability to participate in classroom discussions because of so many other students. The way around that would be to speak to several classmates and create your own discussion group. You could set up a time to meet, or you could take a different route by using technology such as an online discussion board, a Zoom session, or even a group text. Several of the technologically-based solutions might even be better than an in-class discussion since you do not all have to be present at the same time. The discussion can be something that occurs all week long, giving everyone the time to think through their ideas and responses.</p>
          <p id="auto_2f839849-945b-4c12-bb67-645b1dc7f0c0_para-00022" data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:167:5">Again, the main point is to first spot those things in the hidden curriculum that might put your learning at a disadvantage and devise a solution that either reduces the negative impact or even becomes a learning advantage.</p>

You will meet new people, including classmates, college staff, and professors. You may also be living in a different environment, which may mean that a roommate is another new person to get to know. Overall, you will most likely feel both excited and nervous. You can be assured that even if the beginning of the semester goes smoothly, your classes will get more challenging each week. You will be making friends, learning who in your classes seem to know what is going on, and figuring your way around campus. You may even walk into the wrong building, go to the wrong class, or have trouble finding what you need during this time. But those first-week jitters will end soon. Students who are living away from home for the first time can feel homesick in the first few weeks, and others can feel what is called &#x201C;imposter syndrome,&#x201D; which is a fear some students have that they don&#x2019;t belong in college because they don&#x2019;t have the necessary skills for success. Those first few weeks sound pretty stressful, but the stress is temporary.</p>
          <p id="auto_2f839849-945b-4c12-bb67-645b1dc7f0c0_para-00042" data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:228:5">After the newness of college wears off, reality will set in. You may find that the courses and assignments do not seem much different than they did in high school (more on that later), but you may be in for a shock when you get your graded tests and papers. Many new college students find that their first grades are lower than they expected. For some students, this may mean they have earned a B when they are used to earning As, but for many students, it means they may experience their first <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:228:522">failing or almost-failing grades</em> in college because they have not used active, effective study strategies; instead, they studied how they did in high school, which is often insufficient. This can be a shock if you are not prepared, but it doesn&#x2019;t have to devastate you if you are willing to use it as a wake-up call to do something different.</p>
          <p id="auto_2f839849-945b-4c12-bb67-645b1dc7f0c0_para-00043" data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:229:5">By the middle of the semester, you&#x2019;ll likely feel much more confident and a little more relaxed. Your grades are improving because you started tutoring and using better study strategies. You are looking ahead, even beyond the first semester, to start planning your courses for the next term. If you are working while in college, you may also find that you have a rhythm down for balancing it all; additionally, your time management skills have likely improved.</p>
          <p id="auto_2f839849-945b-4c12-bb67-645b1dc7f0c0_para-00044" data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:230:5">By the last few weeks of the semester, you will be focused on the increasing importance of your assignments and upcoming finals and trying to figure out how to juggle that with the family obligations of the impending holidays. You may feel a little more pressure to prepare for finals, as this time is often viewed as the most stressful period of the semester. All of this additional workload and need to plan for the next semester can seem overwhelming, but if you plan ahead and use what you learn from this chapter and the rest of the course, you will be able to get through it more easily.</p>

Your time in college is meant for exploration. Being open to things like meeting new people, having new ideas, and seeking new activities helps make the transition into college a little easier. Do not be afraid of stepping out of your comfort zone and just embrace the opportunities that come your way. If you are struggling with transitioning to college, do not hesitate to reach out for help. Most colleges have resources, such as counseling services, that can help you with your needs. Everyone experiences the transition to college differently, and it is okay to take a longer time than others to adjust to the new lifestyle. If you put in effort towards having a good transition to college by doing things like getting involved in campus organizations, finding friends, and asking for help when needed, then your time at college will be a more eventful and memorable experience. &#x2013;William Kyle, junior</p>

What if they found that the first few weeks were a little harder than they had anticipated? Should they have given up and dropped out? Or should they have talked to someone about their struggles? Here is a secret about college success that not many people know: successful students seek help. They use resources. And they do that as often as necessary to get what they need. Your professors and advisors will expect the same from you, and your college will have all kinds of offices, staff, and programs that are designed to help. This bears calling out again: <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00004/index.cnxml:238:664">you need to use those resources</em>. These are called &#x201C;help-seeking behaviors,&#x201D; and along with self-advocacy, which is speaking up for your needs, they are essential to your success. As you get more comfortable adjusting to life in college, you will find that asking for help is easier. In fact, you may become really good at it by the time you graduate, just in time for you to ask for help finding a job! Review the table on Issues, Campus Resources, and Potential Outcomes for a few examples of times you may need to ask for help. See if you can identify where on campus you can find the same or a similar resource.</p>

If you experience any&#x2014;or even all&#x2014;of these, the important point here is that you are not alone and that you can overcome them by using your resources. Many college students have felt like this before, and they have survived&#x2014;even thrived&#x2014;despite them because they were able to identify a strategy or resource that they could use to help themselves. At some point in your academic career, you may do one or more of the following:</p>

There is one more element of the experience that will improve your ability to meet the expectations and new challenges: Your belief in your abilities to learn, grow, and change. No doubt that you have enrolled in college because you want to do those very things, but it is easy to get discouraged and revert to old ways of thinking about your abilities if you are not mindful of what kinds of thoughts you have about yourself. This section covers the concept of a fixed mindset, or the belief that you are born with certain unchangeable talents, and growth mindset, or the belief that with effort you can improve in any area. Understanding the role that your beliefs play in the eventual outcomes of your learning can help you get through those challenges that you may encounter.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:30:5">Performance vs. Learning Goals</h3>
          <p id="auto_1cb8f4be-4435-4b31-a574-1c4262ce7a05_para-00003" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:31:5">Much of our ability to learn is governed by our motivations and goals. Sometimes hidden goals or mindsets can impact the learning process. In truth, we all have goals that we might not be fully aware of, or if we are aware of them, we might not understand how they help or restrict our ability to learn. An illustration of this can be seen in a comparison of a student that has <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:31:405">performance</em>-based goals with a student that has <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:31:491">learning</em>-based goals.</p>
          <p id="auto_1cb8f4be-4435-4b31-a574-1c4262ce7a05_para-00004" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:32:5">If you are a student with strict performance goals, your primary psychological concern might be to appear intelligent to others. At first, this might not seem to be a bad thing for college, but it can truly limit your ability to move forward in your own learning. Instead, you would tend to play it safe without even realizing it. For example, a student who is strictly performance-goal-oriented will often only say things in a classroom discussion when they think it will make them look knowledgeable to the instructor or their classmates. Likewise, a performance-oriented student might ask a question that they know is beyond the topic being covered (e.g., asking about the economics of Japanese whaling while discussing the book <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:32:759">Moby Dick</em> in an American literature course). Rarely will they ask a question in class because they actually do not understand a concept. Instead they will ask questions that make them look intelligent to others or in an effort to &#x201C;stump the teacher.&#x201D; When they do finally ask an honest question, it may be because they are more afraid that their lack of understanding will result in a poor performance on an exam rather than simply wanting to learn.</p>
          <p id="auto_1cb8f4be-4435-4b31-a574-1c4262ce7a05_para-00005" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:33:5">If you are a student who is driven by learning goals, your interactions in classroom discussions are usually quite different. You see the opportunity to share ideas and ask questions as a way to gain knowledge quickly. In a classroom discussion you can ask for clarification immediately if you don&#x2019;t quite understand what is being discussed. If you are a person guided by learning goals, you are less worried about what others think since you are there to learn and you see that as the most important goal.</p>
          <p id="auto_1cb8f4be-4435-4b31-a574-1c4262ce7a05_para-00006" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:34:5">Another example where the difference between the two mindsets is clear can be found in assignments and other coursework. If you are a student who is more concerned about performance, you may avoid work that is challenging. You will take the &#x201C;easy A&#x201D; route by relying on what you already know. You will not step out of your comfort zone because your psychological goals are based on approval of your performance instead of being motivated by learning.</p>
          <p id="auto_1cb8f4be-4435-4b31-a574-1c4262ce7a05_para-00007" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:35:5">This is very different from a student with a learning-based psychology. If you are a student who is motivated by learning goals, you may actively seek challenging assignments, and you will put a great deal of effort into using the assignment to expand on what you already know. While getting a good grade is important to you, what is even more important is the learning itself.</p>
          <p id="auto_1cb8f4be-4435-4b31-a574-1c4262ce7a05_para-00008" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:36:5">If you find that you sometimes lean toward performance-based goals, do not feel discouraged. Many of the best students tend to initially focus on performance until they begin to see the ways it can restrict their learning. The key to switching to learning-based goals is often simply a matter of first recognizing the difference and seeing how making a change can positively impact your own learning.</p>
          <p id="auto_1cb8f4be-4435-4b31-a574-1c4262ce7a05_para-00009" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:37:5">What follows in this section is a more in-depth look at the difference between performance- and learning- based goals. This is followed by an exercise that will give you the opportunity to identify, analyze, and determine a positive course of action in a situation where you believe you could improve in this area.</p>

In Dweck&#x2019;s work, she determined that a student&#x2019;s perception about their own learning accompanied by a broader goal of learning had a significant influence on their ability to overcome challenges and grow in knowledge and ability. This has become known as the Fixed vs. Growth Mindset model. In this model, the <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:41:454">performance</em>-goal-oriented student is represented by the <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:41:548">fixed</em> mindset, while the <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:41:611">learning</em>-goal- oriented student is represented by the <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:41:703">growth</em> mindset.</p>

If you had learning as your major goal, you would normally keep trying to attain that goal even if it took you multiple attempts. Not only that, but if you learned a little bit more with each try you would see each attempt as a success, even if you had not achieved complete mastery of whatever it was you were working to learn.</p>

At first, this may seem like the sort of feel-good advice we often encounter in social media posts or quotes that are intended to inspire or motivate us (e.g., <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:54:355">believe in yourself!</em>), but in looking at the differences outlined between a fixed and a growth mindset, you can see how each part of the growth mindset path can increase your probability of success when it comes to learning.</p>

Often we tend to lean one way or another in certain situations. For example, a person trying to improve their ability in a sport they enjoy may exhibit all of the growth mindset traits and characteristics, but they find themselves blocked in a fixed mindset when they try to learn something in another area like computer programming or arithmetic.</p>

Using the outline presented below, in the far right column, write down how you can change your own behavior for each of the parts of the learning process. What will you do to move from a fixed to a growth mindset? For example, say you were trying to learn to play a musical instrument. In the <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:58:445">Challenges</em> row, you might pursue a growth path by trying to play increasingly more difficult songs rather than sticking to the easy ones you have already mastered. In the <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:58:654">Criticism</em> row, you might take someone&#x2019;s comment about a weakness in timing as a motivation for you to practice with a metronome. For <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00005/index.cnxml:58:825">Success of Others</em> you could take inspiration from a famous musician that is considered a master and study their techniques.</p>

She enjoys texting and calling them almost every day, and they like hearing what she is doing. She especially likes video-chatting with her younger brother. He had a hard time when she left, because he relied on her to help him with his homework.</p>

At first her parents encouraged her to stay and join an organization to meet other people. &#x201C;It will take some time to get used to being away, but it will get better,&#x201D; they assured her. After some time, Ana began to feel better about being away and started making friends in her classes.</p>

Her mother has not been able to care for him and her little brother at the same time as her father needs daily treatments and weekly doctor&#x2019;s appointments. Between his being off work and the mounting costs of his treatment, the family is concerned about being able to pay for Ana&#x2019;s college expenses. They ask Ana if she can come home for a few weeks to take her brother to school and help around the house, and want to talk to her about what to do next semester.</p>

That was true, but after being in college for a couple of weeks, I felt that people made it seem scarier than it actually was. I had some homework assignments here, some essays, some hard classes, but it wasn't that bad...until midterms and finals came knocking. I had so much to study and so little time. The pressure was unimaginable. And since there was so much material to learn, I kept procrastinating. The nights before the exams were a disaster.</p>
                  <p id="auto_8de21c59-9c76-46df-8e84-12ef0d4d8ec2_para-00004" data-sm="./modules/m00006/index.cnxml:45:5">After the semester, I realized that I needed to do something differently. Instead of crashing before midterms and finals, I would study throughout the semester. I would review notes after class, do a few practice problems in the book even if homework wasn't assigned, and try to ask professors questions during their office hours if I was confused. This continual effort helped me do better on exams because I built up my understanding and was able to get a good night&#x2019;s sleep before the big test. I still studied hard, but the material was in reach and understanding it became a reasonable goal, not an impossibility. I also felt more confident going into the exams, because I knew that I had a deeper knowledge &#x2014; I could recall things more easily. Most importantly, I now had peace of mind throughout the day and during the tests themselves, since I knew that I was better prepared.&#x201D;</p>

For high school students, almost all school time is managed by educators and parents. In many cases, even after-school time may be set by scheduled activities (such as athletics) and by nightly homework that is due the next day.</p>
        <p id="auto_8885a816-9ac2-4e11-92a5-62a49335887c_para-00003" data-sm="./modules/m00007/index.cnxml:26:5">In the workplace, the situation is not very different, with activities and time on task being monitored by the company and its management. An employee may also not have much say in what needs to be done and when. This is so much a part of the working environment that many companies research how much time each task should take, and they hold employees accountable for the time spent on these job functions. In fact, having good time and task management skills will help you stand out on the job and in job interviews. See the table below for a comparison of high school students and college students with regard to time and task management.</p>

While it is true that there are assignment due dates and organized classroom activities, learning at the college level requires more than just the simple completion of work. It involves decision-making and the ability to evaluate information. This is best accomplished when you are an active partner in your own learning activities.</p>

To complete the assignment, you are given time to research and reflect on the information found. As a part of the assignment, you must reach your own conclusions and determine which information that you have found is best suited for the presentation. While the date of the actual presentation and how long it will last are usually determined by the instructor, how much time you spend gathering information, the sources you use, and how you use them are left to you.</p>

          <p id="auto_8885a816-9ac2-4e11-92a5-62a49335887c_para-00006" data-sm="./modules/m00007/index.cnxml:61:5">For college-level learning, this approach is important enough that you can expect to spend much more time on learning activities outside the classroom than you will in the classroom. In fact, the estimated time you should spend will be at least two hours of outside learning for every one hour of lecture. Some weeks may be more intense, depending on the time of the semester and the courses you are taking. If those hours are multiplied over several courses in a given session, you can see how there is a significant amount of time to manage. Unfortunately, many students do not always take this into consideration, and they spend far less time than is needed to be successful. The results of poor time management are often a shock to them.</p>

          <p id="auto_8885a816-9ac2-4e11-92a5-62a49335887c_para-00008" data-sm="./modules/m00007/index.cnxml:68:5" class="has-noteref">Returning to our example of the classroom-presentation assignment, you can see that the types of learning activities in college can be very different from what you have experienced previously. While there may have been similar assignments in high school, such as presentations or written papers, the level of expectation with length and depth is significantly different in college. This point is made very clear when comparing facts about the requirements of high school work to the type of work students produce in college. A study conducted by the Pew Research Center, found that 82 percent of teens report that their typical high school writing assignments were only a single paragraph to one page in length.<a href="#auto_8885a816-9ac2-4e11-92a5-62a49335887c_ch02rfin-1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">1</a> This is in stark contrast to a number of sources that say that writing assignments in lower-level college courses are usually 5&#x2013;7 pages in length, while writing assignments in upper-level courses increase to 15&#x2013;20 pages.</p>

The table below indicates the estimated average amount of writing assigned in several disciplines. To estimate the number of pages of assigned writing, the average number of writing assignments of a given page length was multiplied by an approximate number of pages for the assignment type (see <a href="#auto_8885a816-9ac2-4e11-92a5-62a49335887c_ch02tab03" data-sm="./modules/m00007/index.cnxml:69:454" class="autogenerated-content">Table 3.2</a> for time on task estimates.)</p>

In other words, all the students are doing the same tasks, at relatively the same time, as directed by their teachers.</p>
          <p id="auto_8885a816-9ac2-4e11-92a5-62a49335887c_para-00011" data-sm="./modules/m00007/index.cnxml:129:5">Using the earlier example of the presentation assignment, not only will what you do be larger in scale, but the depth of understanding and knowledge you will put into it will be significantly more than you may have encountered in previous assignments. This is because there are greater expectations required of college graduates in the workplace. Nearly any profession that requires a college degree has with it a level of responsibility that demands higher-level thinking and therefore higher learning. An often-cited example of this is the healthcare professional. The learning requirements for that profession are strict because we depend on those graduates for our health and, in some cases, our lives. While not every profession may require the same level of study needed for healthcare, most do require that colleges maintain a certain level of academic rigor to produce graduates who are competent in their fields.</p>

For most people, a little procrastination is not a cause for great concern. But there are situations where procrastination can become a serious problem with a lot of risk. These include when it becomes a chronic habit, when there are a number of tasks to complete and little time, or when the task being avoided is very important. In college, students who procrastinate often report that they feel more stress and are more likely to do poorly than those who have learned to manage their time and their projects effectively.</p>

Ironically, many of the psychological reasons for why we avoid a given task also keep us from using critical thinking to understand why procrastination can be extremely detrimental, and in some cases difficult to overcome.</p>

Procrastination is often one of the biggest. What follows is an overview of procrastination with a few suggestions on how to avoid it.</p>

On the surface we often tell ourselves it is because the task is something we do not want to do, or we make excuses that there are other things more important to do first. In some cases this may be true, but there can be other contributors to procrastination that have their roots in our physical well-being or our own psychological motivations.</p>

It might be due to discomfort, an illness, or just a lack of energy. If this is the case, it is important to identify the cause and remedy the situation. It could be something as simple as a lack of sleep or improper diet. Regardless, if a lack of energy is continually causing you to procrastinate to the point where you are beginning to feel stress over not getting things done, you should definitely assess the situation and address it.</p>

This can be due to mental fatigue, being disorganized, or allowing yourself to be distracted by other things. Again, like low physical energy, this is something that may have farther-reaching effects in your life that go beyond the act of simply avoiding a task. If it is something that is recurring, you should properly assess the situation.</p>

To put it in simple words, it is a bit of trickery we play on ourselves by avoiding a situation that makes us psychologically uncomfortable. Even though they may not be consciously aware of it, the person facing the task is afraid that they cannot do it or will not be able to do it well. If they fail at the task, it will make them appear incompetent to others or even to themselves. Where the self-trickery comes in is by avoiding the task. In the person&#x2019;s mind, they can rationalize that the reason they failed at the task was because they ran out of time to complete it, not that they were incapable of doing it in the first place.</p>
            <p id="auto_b46b6309-0c97-422c-94f3-bee4f11a30fd_para-00009" data-sm="./modules/m00008/index.cnxml:46:5">It is important to note that a fear of failure may not have anything to do with the actual ability of the person suffering from it. They could be quite capable of doing the task and performing well, but it is the fear that holds them back.</p>

Procrastination can be thought of as using the time you have to complete a task in ways that do not accomplish what needs to be done.</p>

Completing a task leads to achieving a goal. These can be large or small (e.g., from doing well on an assignment to being hired for a good job). Without goals you might do more than delay work on a task&#x2014;you may not complete it at all. The risk for the loss of goals is something that is very impactful.</p>

If this continues to happen, we can begin to develop a low opinion of ourselves and our own abilities. We begin to suffer from low self-esteem and might even begin to feel like there is something wrong with us. This can lead to other increasingly negative mental factors such as anger and depression. As you can see, it is important for our own well-being to avoid this kind of procrastination effect.</p>

Anyone who has noticed that nagging feeling when they know there is something else they should be doing is familiar with this.</p>
            <p id="auto_b46b6309-0c97-422c-94f3-bee4f11a30fd_para-00016" data-sm="./modules/m00008/index.cnxml:70:5">On the other hand, some students see that kind of stress as a boost of mental urgency. They put off a task until they feel that surge of motivation. While this may have worked in the past, they quickly learn that procrastinating when it comes to college work almost always includes an underestimation of the tasks to be completed&#x2014; sometimes with disastrous results.</p>

Distractions are time-killers and are the primary way people procrastinate. It is too easy to just play a video game a little while longer, check out social media, or finish watching a movie when we are avoiding a task. Putting aside distractions is one of the primary functions of setting priorities.</p>

This may not seem like it would be very effective, but on a psychological level we feel more compelled to do something if we tell someone else. It may be related to our need for approval from others, or it might just serve to set a level of commitment. Either way, it can help us stay on task and avoid procrastination&#x2014;especially if we take our accountability to another person seriously enough to warrant contacting that person and apologizing for not doing what we said we were going to do.</p>

      First and foremost, whenever you begin your college career you need to understand the importance of time management. Without time management you have nothing. You will no longer have your mother or father banging on your door telling you to wake up, because the bus is gonna be at the house in 20 minutes to pick you up. That is all out the window and you now have to depend on yourself. With understanding time management and the importance of a routine that works for you: you will have to be at your classes on time, appointments, and remind yourself to study. You can set alarms, make a schedule, or even carry a journal around with you so you can document all the things you need to complete that day to keep everything organized and on track. I mean, I wish I knew how important time management was when I started college. Maybe I would&#x2019;ve saved myself from having multiple stressful situations, where I forgot something was due and took a zero, or missed a doctor&#x2019;s appointment that cost me $20 extra dollars I needed for gas to get home. Realizing how important your day to day life is and how you dedicate your time to your education, will certainly determine your outcome in college. Hint: It will also save you from a ton of unnecessary stress! &#x2013;Morgan Goodknight, sophomore

If you are a person that likes strict deadlines, what would you do if you took a course that only had one large paper due at the end? Can you set a series of mini deadlines that made you more comfortable and that kept things moving along for you? Or, if you have difficulty prioritizing tasks, does it help you to make a list of the tasks to do and order them, so you know which ones must be finished first?</p>

          <p id="auto_da232d94-d30e-4f2e-aedc-b94e1fe7e1fc_para-00006" data-sm="./modules/m00009/index.cnxml:114:5">The simplest way to manage your time is to accurately plan for how much time it will take to do each task, and then set aside that amount of time. How you divide the time is up to you. If it is going to take you five hours to study for a final exam, you can plan to spread it over five days, with an hour each night, or you can plan on two hours one night and three hours the next. What you would not want to do is plan on studying only a few hours the night before the exam and find that you fell very short on the time you estimated you would need. If that were to happen, you would have run out of time before finishing, with no way to go back and change your decision. In this kind of situation, you might even be tempted to &#x201C;pull an all-nighter,&#x201D; which is a phrase that has been used among college students for decades. In essence it means going without sleep for the entire night and using that time to finish an assignment. While this method of trying to make up for poor planning is common enough to have a name, rarely does it produce the best work.</p>

Part of the problem comes from the fact that most of us are not very accurate timekeepers, especially when we are busy applying ourselves to a task. The other issue that makes it so difficult to accurately estimate time on task is that our estimations must also account for things like interruptions or unforeseen problems that cause delays.</p>
          <p id="auto_da232d94-d30e-4f2e-aedc-b94e1fe7e1fc_para-00013" data-sm="./modules/m00009/index.cnxml:142:5">When it comes to academic activities, many tasks can be dependent upon the completion of other things first, or the time a task takes can vary from one instance to another, both of which add to the complexity and difficulty of estimating how much time and effort are required.</p>
          <p id="auto_da232d94-d30e-4f2e-aedc-b94e1fe7e1fc_para-00014" data-sm="./modules/m00009/index.cnxml:143:5">For example, if an instructor assigned three chapters of reading, you would not really have any idea how long each chapter might take to read until you looked at them. The first chapter might be 30 pages long while the second is 45. The third chapter could be only 20 pages but made up mostly of charts and graphs for you to compare. By page count, it might seem that the third chapter would take the least amount of time, but actually studying charts and graphs to gather information can take longer than regular reading.</p>
          <p id="auto_da232d94-d30e-4f2e-aedc-b94e1fe7e1fc_para-00015" data-sm="./modules/m00009/index.cnxml:144:5">To make matters even more difficult, when it comes to estimating time on task for something as common as reading, not all reading takes the same amount of time. Fiction, for example, is usually a faster read than a technical manual. But something like the novel <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00009/index.cnxml:144:289">Finnegan&#x2019;s Wake</em> by James Joyce is considered so difficult that most readers never finish it.</p>

Before you begin, estimate how long it will take you to read each, and predict which you think will take longer. When you do the reading, use a stopwatch function on a device such as a phone or some other timer to see how long it actually takes.</p>

Not only do these differences in time account for the different types of materials you might read (as you found in the comparative reading exercise earlier in this chapter), but also they also take into consideration the time needed to think about what you are reading to truly understand and comprehend what it is saying.</p>

It can be all too easy to immediately respond to a problem as soon as it pops up without thinking of the consequences of your reaction and how it might impact other priorities. It is very natural for us to want to remove a stressful situation as soon as we can. We want the adverse emotions out of the way as quickly as possible. But when it comes to juggling multiple problems or tasks to complete, prioritizing them first may mean the difference between completing everything satisfactorily and completing nothing at all.</p>

If you have multiple assignments to complete and you assume one of those assignments will only take an hour, you may decide to put it off until the others are finished. Your assumption could be disastrous if you find, once you begin the assignment, that there are several extra components that you did not account for and the time to complete will be four times as long as you estimated. Or, one of the assignments may be dependent on the results of another&#x2014;like participating in a study and then writing a report on the results. If you are not aware that one assignment depends upon the completion of the other before you begin, you could inadvertently do the assignments out of order and have to start over. Because of situations like this, it is critically important to understand exactly what needs to be done to complete a task before you determine its priority.</p>

When you have completed writing each of the tasks in its appropriate square, you will see a prioritization order of your tasks. Obviously, those listed in the Important and Urgent square will be the things you need to finish first. After that will come things that are &#x201C;important but not urgent,&#x201D; followed by &#x201C;not important, but urgent,&#x201D; and finally &#x201C;not urgent and not important.&#x201D;</p>

          <h3 data-type="title" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:55:5">Who Is Driving Your Tasks?</h3>
          <p id="auto_5fcadc5d-febb-4402-b898-e829fb1fb735_para-00010" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:56:5">Another thing to keep in mind when approaching time management is that while you may have greater autonomy in managing your own time, many of your tasks are being driven by a number of different individuals. These individuals are not only unaware of the other things you need to do, but they often also have goals that are in conflict with your other tasks. This means that different instructors, your manager at work, or even your friends may be trying to assert their needs into your priorities. An example of this might be a boss who would like for you to work a few hours of overtime, but you were planning on using that time to do research for a paper.</p>
          <p id="auto_5fcadc5d-febb-4402-b898-e829fb1fb735_para-00011" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:57:5">Just like assessing the requirements and needs for each priority, doing the same with how others may be influencing your available time can be an important part of time management. In some cases, keeping others informed about your priorities may help avert possible conflicts (e.g., letting your boss know you will need time on a certain evening to study, letting your friends know you plan to do a journal project on Saturday but can do something on Sunday, etc.).</p>
          <p id="auto_5fcadc5d-febb-4402-b898-e829fb1fb735_para-00012" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:58:5">It will be important to be aware of how others can drive your priorities and for you to listen to your own good judgment. In essence, time management in college is as much about managing all the elements of your life as it is about managing time for class and to complete assignments.</p>

          <p id="auto_5fcadc5d-febb-4402-b898-e829fb1fb735_para-00013" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:62:5">Occasionally, regardless of how much you have planned or how well you have managed your time, events arise where it becomes almost impossible to accomplish everything you need to by the time required. While this is very unfortunate, it simply cannot be helped. As the saying goes, &#x201C;things happen.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_5fcadc5d-febb-4402-b898-e829fb1fb735_para-00014" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:63:5">Finding yourself in this kind of situation is when prioritization becomes most important. You may find yourself in the uncomfortable position of only being able to complete one task or another in the time given. When this occurs with college assignments, the dilemma can be extremely stressful, but it is important to not feel overwhelmed by the anxiety of the situation so that you can make a carefully calculated decision based on the value and impact of your choice.</p>

This is when it becomes critical to understand all the factors involved. While it may seem that whichever assignment is worth the most points to your grade is how you make the choice, there are actually a number of other attributes that can influence your decision in order to make the most of a bad situation. For example, one of the assignments may only be worth a minimal number of points toward your total grade, but it may be foundational to the rest of the course. Not finishing it, or finishing it late, may put other future assignments in jeopardy as well. Or the instructor for one of the courses might have a &#x201C;late assignment&#x201D; policy that is more forgiving&#x2014;something that would allow you to turn in the work a little late without too much of a penalty.</p>

If that simply cannot happen, the next immediate step would be to communicate with your instructors to let them know about the situation. They may be able to help you decide on a course of action, or they may have options you had not thought of. Only then can you make the choices about prioritizing in a tough situation.</p>

Additionally, some elements may not only be dependent on the order they are completed, but can also be dependent on how they are completed. To illustrate this we will analyze a task that is usually considered to be a simple one: <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:76:406">attending a class session.</em> In this analysis we will look at not only what must be accomplished to get the most out of the experience, but also at how each element is dependent upon others and must be done in a specific order. The <a href="#auto_5fcadc5d-febb-4402-b898-e829fb1fb735_ch02fig07" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:76:674" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 3.7</a> below shows the interrelationship between the different activities, many of which might not initially seem significant enough to warrant mention, but it becomes obvious that other elements depend upon them when they are listed out this way.</p>

One example of this is preparing for the class lecture by reading materials ahead of time in order to make the lecture and any complex concepts easier to follow. If you did it the other way around, you might miss opportunities to ask questions or receive clarification on the information presented during the lecture.</p>

            <p id="auto_5fcadc5d-febb-4402-b898-e829fb1fb735_para-00024" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:86:5">This may not be as easy or as simple as declaring that you will finish part one, then move on to part two, and so on. Each component may need different resources or skills to complete, and it is in your best interest to identify those ahead of time and include them as part of your plan.</p>
            <p id="auto_5fcadc5d-febb-4402-b898-e829fb1fb735_para-00025" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:87:5">A good analogy for this sort of planning is to think about it in much the same way you would preparing for a lengthy trip. With a long journey you probably would not walk out the front door and then decide how you were going to get where you were going. There are too many other decisions to be made and tasks to be completed around each choice. If you decided you were going by plane, you would need to purchase tickets, and you would have to schedule your trip around flight times. If you decided to go by car, you would need gas money and possibly a map or GPS device. What about clothes? The clothes you will need are dependent on how long you will be gone and what the climate will be like. If it is far enough away that you will need to speak another language, you may need to either acquire that skill or at least come with something or someone to help you translate.</p>
            <p id="auto_5fcadc5d-febb-4402-b898-e829fb1fb735_para-00026" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:88:5">What follows is a planning list that can help you think about and prepare for the tasks you are about to begin.</p>

Have you ever planned a trip but forgotten your most comfortable pair of shoes or neglected to book a hotel room? If a missing resource is important, the entire project can come to a complete halt. Even if the missing resource is a minor component, it may still dramatically alter the end result.</p>
              <p id="auto_5fcadc5d-febb-4402-b898-e829fb1fb735_para-00028" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:92:5">Learning activities are much the same in this way, and it is also important to keep in mind that resources may not be limited to physical objects such as paper or ink. Information can be a critical resource as well. In fact, one of the most often overlooked aspects in planning by new college students is just how much research, reading, and information they will need to complete assignments.</p>

No matter how well you planned the other parts of the project, if there is some skill needed that you do not have and you have no idea how long it will take to learn, it can be a bad situation.</p>

It is your intent to use some kind of imaging software to produce professional-looking graphics and charts for the poster, but you have never used the software in that way before. It seems easy enough, but once you begin, you find the charts keep printing out in the wrong resolution. You search online for a solution, but the only thing you can find requires you to recreate them all over again in a different setting. Unfortunately, that part of the project will now take twice as long.</p>

Giving yourself two days to write a 20- page work of fiction is not very realistic when even many professional authors average only 6 pages per day. Your intentions may be well founded, but your use of unrealistic deadlines will not be very successful.</p>

The reason that <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:111:198">being flexible</em> has made this list is because even the best-laid plans and most accurate time management efforts can take an unexpected turn. The idea behind being flexible is to readjust your plans and deadlines when something does happen to throw things off. The worst thing you could do in such a situation is panic or just stop working because the next step in your careful planning has suddenly become a roadblock. The moment when you see that something in your plan may become an issue is when to begin readjusting your plan.</p>

In fact, many professional project managers have learned that it seems something <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:112:161">always</em> happens or there is always some delay, and they have developed an approach to deal with the inevitable need for some flexibility. In essence, you could say that they are even planning for problems, mistakes, or delays from the very beginning, and they will often add a little extra time for each task to help ensure an issue does not derail the entire project or that the completion of the project does not miss the final due date.</p>

Much of this has to do with the environment where you will do your work. This not only includes physical space such as a work area, but other conditions like being free from distractions and your physical well-being and mental attitude.</p>

One example of this might be typing on a laptop. While it might seem more comfortable to lie back on a couch and type a long paper, sitting up at a desk or table actually increases your typing speed and reduces the number of mistakes. Even the kind of mouse you use can impact how you work, and using one you are comfortable with can make a big difference.</p>
              <p id="auto_5fcadc5d-febb-4402-b898-e829fb1fb735_para-00040" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:127:5">There are a host of other factors that can come into play as well. Do you have enough space? Is the space cluttered, or do you have the room to keep reference materials and other things you might need within arm&#x2019;s reach? Are there other ways you could work that might be even more efficient? For example, buying an inexpensive second monitor&#x2014;even secondhand&#x2014;might be the key to decreasing the amount of time you spend when you can have more than one document displayed at a time.</p>

Before deciding that the television or talkative roommates do not bother you when you work, take an honest accounting of the work you produce with interruptions compared to work you do without.</p>

This may mean you have to go to a private room, use headphones, or go somewhere like a library to work. Regardless, the importance of a distraction-free environment cannot be emphasized enough.</p>

Some are alert and energetic in the mornings, while others are considered &#x201C;night owls&#x201D; and prefer to work after everyone else has gone to sleep. It can be important to be aware of your own cycles and to use them to your advantage. Rarely does anyone do their best work when they are exhausted, either physically or mentally. Just as it can be difficult to work when you are physically ill, it can also be a hindrance to try to learn or do mental work when you are tired or emotionally upset.</p>
              <p id="auto_5fcadc5d-febb-4402-b898-e829fb1fb735_para-00046" data-sm="./modules/m00010/index.cnxml:139:5">Your working environment definitely includes your own state of mind and physical well-being. Both have a significant influence on your learning and production ability. Because of this, it is not only important to be aware of your own condition and work preferences, but to actually try to create conditions that help you in these areas. One approach is to set aside a specific time to do certain kinds of work. You might find that you concentrate better after you have eaten a meal. If that is the case, make it a habit of doing homework every night after dinner. Or you might enjoy reading more after you are ready for bed, so you do your reading assignments just before you go to sleep at night. Some people find that they are more creative during a certain time of the day or that they are more comfortable writing with subtle lighting. It is worth taking the time to find the conditions that work best for you so that you can take advantage of them.</p>

But others, those which people find of value, do. What follows here are three unique strategies that have become staples of time management. While not everyone will find that all three work for them in every situation, enough people have found them beneficial to pass them along with high recommendations.</p>

One is the benefit that is derived from quick cycles of work and short breaks. This helps reduce mental fatigue and the lack of productivity caused by it. Another is that it tends to encourage practitioners to break tasks down to things that can be completed in about 25 minutes, which is something that is usually manageable from the perspective of time available. It is much easier to squeeze in three 25-minute sessions of work time during the day than it is to set aside a 75- minute block of time.</p>

          <p id="auto_8eac3e4c-6b08-48d2-98c6-7f29f7c26836_para-00011" data-sm="./modules/m00011/index.cnxml:61:5">Although stated in a humorous way, there is a good deal of truth in this. First, we greatly underestimate how much worry can impact our performance. If you are continually distracted by anxiety over a task you are dreading, it can affect the task you are working on at the time. Second, not only will you have a sense of accomplishment and relief when the task you are concerned with is finished and out of the way, but other tasks will seem lighter and not as difficult.</p>

Is there one you favor over the others? Might each of these three approaches serve you better in different situations or with different tasks? Do you have a creative alternative or possibly a way to use some combination of these techniques?</p>

For example, you could apply some of the strategies for avoiding procrastination or for setting appropriate priorities and see how they work in combination with these techniques or on their own.</p>

In this section you will read about two more creative techniques that combine elements from these other methods to handle tasks when time is scarce and long periods of time are a luxury you just do not have.</p>

As an illustration of how this might work, imagine that you are assigned a two-page paper that is to include references. You estimate that to complete the paper&#x2014;start to finish&#x2014;would take you between four and a half and five hours. You look at your calendar over the next week and see that there simply are no open five-hour blocks (unless you decided to only get three hours of sleep one night). Rightly so, you decide that going without sleep is not a good option. While looking at your calendar, you do see that you can squeeze in an hour or so every night. Instead of trying to write the entire paper in one sitting, you break it up into much smaller components and schedule them over the week as shown in the two tables below:</p>

In fact, if your time constraints were even more rigid, it would be possible to break these divided tasks down even further. You could use a variation of the Pomodoro Technique and write for three 25-minute segments each day at different times. The key is to look for ways to break down the entire task into smaller steps and spread them out to fit your schedule.</p>

His boss really values JT&#x2019;s work ethic and has started expecting that JT will fill in whenever his co-workers ask for time off or, in some cases, just don&#x2019;t show up. And JT feels that going the extra mile will help him get a promotion and raise, which would allow him to earn more without working more.</p>

Then, sections of the text covered how time management for college can be different from what students may have experienced before. Following this, the chapter contained several sections on how to effectively manage time (including predicting time on task), how to use technology to your advantage, and how to prioritize tasks. Other topics included specific strategies for time and task management and avoiding procrastination.</p>

The benefits of good time management skills are something that will apply to the rest of your life, and you will no doubt be working on improving those skills for years to come. Now that you have read and reflected on the main ideas of the chapter, consider developing a plan to help you achieve college success by considering what you want to know more about that could help you. Review the list below and commit to working on one or more of the concepts this term and beyond:</p>

I&#x2019;ve since learned that in most cases I should do what my teacher suggests. I have a course that requires me to read two textbook chapters each week. Taking notes on the chapters is optional, making it easy to brush off these assignments. But there are reasons that professors tell students to read and do other classwork. They believe it is valuable information for a student to learn. Note-taking in class may become tedious and, in some cases, feel redundant, but you can't recall a whole class from memory. There is not much time to learn the contents of a class in one semester, and it can feel overwhelming. It&#x2019;s important to take notes because writing them helps you remember.&#x201D;</p>

Reading helps us make sense of the world&#x2014;from simple reminders to pick up milk to complex treatises on global concerns, we read to comprehend, and in so doing, our brains expand. An interesting study from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, used MRI scans to track the brain conductivity while participants were reading. The researchers assert that a biological change to your brain actually happens when you read, and it lingers. If you want to read the study, published in the journal <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00012/index.cnxml:55:792">Brain Connectivity,</em> you can find it online at <a href="https://openstax.org/l/brainconnectivity" data-sm="./modules/m00012/index.cnxml:55:876" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://openstax.org/l/brainconnectivity</a>.</p>

Seems like a win-win. Take advantage of all the study aids you have at hand, including human, electronic, and physical resources, to increase your performance in these crucial skill sets.</p>
              <p id="auto_09c7a393-054f-453a-a5a0-acca1318b0cd_para-00009" data-sm="./modules/m00012/index.cnxml:57:5">Why? You need to read. It improves your thinking, your vocabulary, and your ability to make connections between disparate parts, which are all parts of critical thinking. Educational researchers Anne Cunningham and Keith Stanovich discovered after extensive study with college students that &#x201C;reading volume [how much you read] made a significant contribution to multiple measures of vocabulary, general knowledge, spelling, and verbal fluency.&#x201D;</p>
              <p id="auto_09c7a393-054f-453a-a5a0-acca1318b0cd_para-00010" data-sm="./modules/m00012/index.cnxml:58:5">Research continues to assess and support the fact that one of the most significant learning skills necessary for success in any field is reading. You may have performed this skill for decades already, but learning to do it more effectively and practicing the skill consistently is critical to how well you do in all subjects. If reading <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00012/index.cnxml:58:364">isn&#x2019;t your thing,</em> strive to make that your challenge. Your academic journey, your personal well-being, and your professional endeavors will all benefit from your reading. Put forth the effort and make it your thing. The long-term benefits will far outweigh the sacrifices you make now.</p>

When we go through <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_1c510076-b3eb-4343-9899-cfd7673fa718_term-00001" data-sm="./modules/m00013/index.cnxml:33:110" group-by="t">the learning process</span> outlined above, our brains actually change. This is called <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00013/index.cnxml:33:239">neuroplasticity</em>, or the brain&#x2019;s ability to form or reorganize neural pathways in reaction to the learning process. This means that when you learn something new, and especially if you practice it and fail at getting it right the first time, your brain is changing. When you get better at a skill such as throwing a curve ball or learning how to solve for X, your brain is actually reorganizing itself so that you can perform those tasks more quickly.</p>
        <p id="auto_1c510076-b3eb-4343-9899-cfd7673fa718_para-00010" data-sm="./modules/m00013/index.cnxml:34:5">So what does this have to do with reading and note-taking? Your learning process has to begin somewhere before you can claim mastery of a concept. Too many students try to move quickly through reading or take only partial notes because they think that just by scanning a text or listening to a lecture and jotting down a few key ideas, they have adequately learned something. True, your brain is changing during those initial processes, but it will take much more practice (also known as studying) to help you recall that information at a later date. Moreover, your goal in college classes is not just to remember the information for a test, but it is to build on that foundational knowledge to learn different levels of thinking, which we will talk about in the next section.</p>

Figuring out how you need to learn the material and how you will be tested on it is part of learning the (sometimes) hidden curriculum.</p>
          <p id="auto_1c510076-b3eb-4343-9899-cfd7673fa718_para-00012" data-sm="./modules/m00013/index.cnxml:38:5" class="has-noteref">If you want some insight into the types of learning you will do in college, you will want to get to know the work of Dr. Benjamin Bloom, an educational psychologist best known for his classification of different levels of learning, and the concept called Bloom's Taxonomy<a href="#auto_1c510076-b3eb-4343-9899-cfd7673fa718_foot-00002" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">2</a>.

The bottom two levels, Remember and Understand, are called "lower levels&#x201D; of Bloom's because they often take less effort than the others, and they are seen as foundational to the learning process.</p>

Not all of your learning in college and the workplace will be at the higher levels of Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy, but as you gain more knowledge and develop more sophisticated academic and workplace skills, you will move beyond merely remembering information.</p>
          <p id="auto_1c510076-b3eb-4343-9899-cfd7673fa718_para-00014" data-sm="./modules/m00013/index.cnxml:40:5">Let&#x2019;s break down the different levels so you have a better understanding of them. The first and lowest level is &#x201C;Remember.&#x201D; At this level, you are attempting to recall information, such as definitions of terms or steps in a process. You don&#x2019;t have to really understand (that will come next) the concepts at this level. For example, you may be able to memorize the steps of the Krebs Cycle by naming them in order, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean you truly understand the processes involved and the effects of each step.</p>
          <p id="auto_1c510076-b3eb-4343-9899-cfd7673fa718_para-00015" data-sm="./modules/m00013/index.cnxml:41:5">The second level is &#x201C;Understand.&#x201D; This is the stage in which you can explain or describe a concept in your own words. Usually, if you have restated a term, concept, or process in your own words, you have a basic understanding of it. Again, these are lower levels of Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy and are the fundamental first steps if you want to move higher up on the taxonomy. The next level is &#x201C;Apply,&#x201D; which indicates that you know the concept well enough to use it in a new context. Math classes often ask you to remember and understand the steps of a formula and the reason you would use it, but then ask that you use that formula in a new problem.</p>
          <p id="auto_1c510076-b3eb-4343-9899-cfd7673fa718_para-00016" data-sm="./modules/m00013/index.cnxml:42:5">The levels in which you &#x201C;Analyze&#x201D; and &#x201C;Evaluate&#x201D; require that you be able to examine the concepts in depth and be able to, for example, compare and contrast a concept with another concept (Analyze) or choose the best concept among others (Evaluate). The final level is &#x201C;Create,&#x201D; which, according to Bloom, is the pinnacle of learning: If you can create (or recreate) something new based on what you have learned, you have demonstrated understanding of a concept, idea, or skill.</p>
          <p id="auto_1c510076-b3eb-4343-9899-cfd7673fa718_para-00017" data-sm="./modules/m00013/index.cnxml:43:5">We will revisit Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy in the chapter on studying, but it is worth introducing in relation to reading and note-taking because students who read texts and take notes on their readings or the professor&#x2019;s lectures are often capturing information to remember it later. This is a good first step to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_1c510076-b3eb-4343-9899-cfd7673fa718_term-00002" data-sm="./modules/m00013/index.cnxml:43:331" group-by="t">the learning process</span>, but as you will see later, that is not the only or final step to learning.</p>

The myriad distractions we now face as well as the intense information overload we can suffer on a daily basis in all aspects of our lives can combine to make it difficult to slow down to read, an activity that demands at least a modicum of attention in a way that most television and music do not. You may need to adjust your schedule for more reading time, especially in college, because every class you take will expect you to read more pages than you probably have in the past.</p>
        <p id="auto_19e28fab-cb5d-4f9e-9901-4a1b5f13d6c9_para-00004" data-sm="./modules/m00014/index.cnxml:27:6">One last suggestion about reading: Many students report that they don&#x2019;t like to read unless they are already interested in the topic. This is understandable when considering that many assigned texts in college may be something students are not familiar with, don&#x2019;t immediately see the benefit of knowing, and are written in a less-than-engaging manner. Your goal when assigned reading that seems &#x201C;uninteresting&#x201D; is to develop your curiosity about the subject and approach your reading like a detective looking for clues to solve a larger mystery. Asking yourself &#x201C;What will I gain from reading this?&#x201D; and &#x201C;How will this reading help me develop skills that I will need now and in the future?&#x201D; are good places to start with developing curiosity. You may be surprised that you are interested in the topic and want to expand your knowledge by reading more about it.</p>

You can find all sorts of information online about how to fix a faucet or tie a secure knot. You won&#x2019;t have to spend too much time reading these sorts of texts because you have a specific goal in mind for them, and once you have accomplished that goal, you do not need to prolong the reading experience. These encounters with texts may not be memorable or stunning, but they don&#x2019;t need to be. When we consider why we read longer pieces&#x2014;outside of reading for pleasure&#x2014;we can usually categorize the reasons into about two categories: 1) reading to introduce ourselves to new content, and 2) reading to more fully comprehend familiar content.</p>

Of course he knew that it had something to do with buildings and construction sites, but the field was so different from his discipline of biology that he decided he needed to find out more so he could at least engage in friendly conversation with his roommates. Since he would likely not go into their field, he didn&#x2019;t need to go into full research mode. Glenn's purpose for reading was specific to his situation. When we read to discover new content, we can start off small and increase to better and more sophisticated sources. Much of our further study and reading depends on the sources we originally read, our purpose for finding out about this new topic, and our interest level.</p>

You may read reviews of a new restaurant or look at what people say about a movie you aren&#x2019;t sure you want to spend the money to see at the theater. This reading helps you decide. In academic settings, much of what you read in your courses may be relatively new content to you. You may have heard the word <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00014/index.cnxml:36:402">volcano</em> and have a general notion of what it means, but until you study geology and other sciences in depth, you may not have a full understanding of the environmental origins, ecological impacts, and societal and historic responses to volcanoes.</p>

When you are working with new content, you may need to schedule more time for reading and comprehending the information because you may need to look up unfamiliar terminology and you may have to stop more frequently to make sure you are truly grasping what the material means. When you have few ways to connect new material to your own prior knowledge, you have to work more diligently to comprehend it.</p>

Without looking on the Internet, try to brainstorm a list of 10 topics about which all of you may be interested but for which you know very little or nothing at all. Try to make the topics somewhat obscure rather than ordinary&#x2014;for example, the possibility of the non-planet Pluto being reclassified again as opposed to something like why we need to drink water.</p>

Our short answer is always: Google. But think of other ways as well. How else could you read about these topics if you don&#x2019;t know anything about them? You may well be in a similar circumstance in some of your college classes, so you should listen carefully to your classmates on this one. Think beyond pat answers such as &#x201C;I&#x2019;d go to the library,&#x201D; and press for what that researcher would do once at the library. What types of articles or books would you try to find? One reason that you should not always ignore the idea of doing research at the physical library is because once you are there and looking for information, you have a vast number of other sources readily available to you in a highly organized location. You also can tap into the human resources represented by the research librarians who likely can redirect you if you cannot find appropriate sources.</p>

Do you really still need to keep reading about it? Probably. For example, what if during the brainstorming activity in the activity above, you secretly felt rather smug because you know about the demotion of the one-time planet Pluto and that there is currently quite the scientific debate going on about that whole de-planet-ation thing. Of course, you didn&#x2019;t say anything during the study session, mostly to spare your classmates any embarrassment, but you are pretty familiar with Pluto-gate. So now what? Can you learn anything new?</p>
            <p id="auto_19e28fab-cb5d-4f9e-9901-4a1b5f13d6c9_para-00011" data-sm="./modules/m00014/index.cnxml:45:6">Again&#x2014;probably. When did Pluto&#x2019;s qualifications to be considered a planet come into question? What are the qualifications for being considered a planet? Why? Who even gets to decide these things? Why was it called <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00014/index.cnxml:45:242">Pluto</em> in the first place? On Amazon alone, you can find hundreds of books about the once-planet Pluto (not to be confused with the Disney dog also named Pluto). A Google search brings up over 34 million options for your reading pleasure. You&#x2019;ll have plenty to read, even if you do know something or quite a bit about a topic, but you&#x2019;ll approach reading about a familiar topic and an unfamiliar one differently.</p>
            <p id="auto_19e28fab-cb5d-4f9e-9901-4a1b5f13d6c9_para-00012" data-sm="./modules/m00014/index.cnxml:46:6">With familiar content, you can do some initial skimming to determine what you already know in the book or article, and mark what may be new information or a different perspective. You may not have to give your full attention to the information you know, but you will spend more time on the new viewpoints so you can determine how this new data meshes with what you already know. Is this writer claiming a radical new definition for the topic or an entirely opposite way to consider the subject matter, connecting it to other topics or disciplines in ways you have never considered?</p>
            <p id="auto_19e28fab-cb5d-4f9e-9901-4a1b5f13d6c9_para-00013" data-sm="./modules/m00014/index.cnxml:47:6">When college students encounter material in a discipline-specific context and have some familiarity with the topic, they sometimes can allow themselves to become a bit overconfident about their knowledge level. Just because a student may have read an article or two or may have seen a TV documentary on a subject such as the criminal mind, that does not make them an expert. What makes an expert is a person who thoroughly studies a subject, usually for years, and understands all the possible perspectives of a subject as well as the potential for misunderstanding due to personal biases and the availability of false information about the topic.</p>

Reading isn&#x2019;t a magic pill, but it may seem like it when you consider all the benefits people reap from this ordinary practice. Famous successful people throughout history have been voracious readers. In fact, former U.S. president Harry Truman once said, &#x201C;Not all readers are leaders, but all leaders are readers.&#x201D; Writer of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, inventor, and also former U.S. president Thomas Jefferson claimed &#x201C;I cannot live without books&#x201D; at a time when keeping and reading books was an expensive pastime. Knowing what it meant to be kept from the joys of reading, 19th-century abolitionist Frederick Douglass said, &#x201C;Once you learn to read, you will be forever free.&#x201D; And finally, George R. R. Martin, the prolific author of the wildly successful <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:33:901">Game of Thrones</em> empire, declared, &#x201C;A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.

Time yourself reading that material for exactly 5 minutes, and note how much reading you accomplished in those 5 minutes. Multiply the amount of reading you accomplished in 5 minutes by 12 to determine your average reading pace (5 times 12 equals the 60 minutes of an hour). Of course, your reading pace will be different and take longer if you are taking notes while you read, but this calculation of reading pace gives you a good way to estimate your reading speed that you can adapt to other forms of reading.</p>

So, for instance, if Marta was able to read 4 pages of a dense novel for her English class in 5 minutes, she should be able to read about 48 pages in one hour. Knowing this, Marta can accurately determine how much time she needs to devote to finishing the novel within a set amount of time, instead of just guessing. If the novel Marta is reading is 497 pages, then Marta would take the total page count (497) and divide that by her hourly reading rate (48 pages/hour) to determine that she needs about 10 to 11 hours overall. To finish the novel spread out over two weeks, Marta needs to read a little under an hour a day to accomplish this goal.</p>

And your reading rate will likely vary depending on how dense the content you&#x2019;re reading is (e.g., a complex textbook vs. a comic book). Your pace may slow down somewhat if you are not very interested in what the text is about. What this method <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:58:460">will</em> help you do is be realistic about your reading time as opposed to waging a guess based on nothing and then becoming worried when you have far more reading to finish than the time available.</p>

You may not need to read your latest sci-fi series actively while you&#x2019;re lounging on the beach, but many other reading situations demand more attention from you. Active reading is particularly important for college courses. You are a scholar actively engaging with the text by posing questions, seeking answers, and clarifying any confusing elements. Plan to spend at least twice as long to read actively than to read passages without taking notes or otherwise marking select elements of the text.</p>

For all the reading you do, you end up doing even more rereading. It may be the same content, but you may be reading the passage more than once to detect the emphasis the writer places on one aspect of the topic or how frequently the writer dismisses a significant counterargument. This rereading is called recursive reading.</p>

You need your full attention to decipher everything that&#x2019;s going on in complex reading material&#x2014;and you even need to be considering what the writer of the piece may <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:88:361">not</em> be including and why. This is why reading for comprehension is recursive.</p>

You may read a selection from beginning to end, which is an excellent starting point, but for comprehension, you&#x2019;ll need to go back and reread passages to determine meaning and make connections between the reading and the bigger learning environment that led you to the selection&#x2014;that may be a single course or a program in your college, or it may be the larger discipline, such as all biologists or the community of scholars studying beach erosion.</p>

Take the steps above on how to evaluate a text, and apply the steps to the article. When you accomplish the task in each step, ask yourself and take notes to answer the question: Why is this important? For example, when you read the title, does that give you any additional information that will help you comprehend the text? If the text were written for a different audience, what might the author need to change to accommodate that group? How does an author&#x2019;s bias distort an argument? This deep evaluation allows you to fully understand the main ideas and place the text in context with other material on the same subject, with current events, and within the discipline.</p>

One challenge we have is applying new information. It may be interesting to know the distance to the moon, but how do we apply it to something we need to do? If your biology instructor asked you to list several challenges of colonizing Mars and you do not know much about that planet&#x2019;s exploration, you may be able to use your knowledge of how far Earth is from the moon to apply it to the new task. You may have to read several other texts in addition to reading graphs and charts to find this information.</p>

They had to take what they already knew and could study and read about and apply it to an unknown situation. These explorers wrote down their challenges, failures, and successes, and now scientists read those texts as a part of the ever-growing body of text about space travel. Application is a sophisticated level of thinking that helps turn theory into practice and challenges into successes.</p>

In this college reading requirement, you can succeed by learning to read actively, researching the topic and author, and recognizing how your own preconceived notions affect your reading. Reading for college isn&#x2019;t the same as reading for pleasure or even just reading to learn something on your own because you are casually interested.</p>

Your instructor may want you to have a general background on a topic before you dive into that subject in class, so that you know the history of a topic, can start thinking about it, and can engage in a class discussion with more than a passing knowledge of the issue.</p>

As you can imagine, a great deal has been written about the Constitution by scholars and citizens since the late 1700s when it was first put to paper (that&#x2019;s how they did it then). While the actual document isn&#x2019;t that long (about 12&#x2013;15 pages depending on how it is presented), learning the details on how it came about, who was involved, and why it was and still is a significant document would take a considerable amount of time to read and digest. So, how do you do it all? Especially when you may have an instructor who drops hints that you may also <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:149:833">love</em> to read a historic novel covering the same time period&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. in your <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:149:945">spare time</em>, not required, of course! It can be daunting, especially if you are taking more than one course that has time-consuming reading lists.

That doesn&#x2019;t mean you give up or decide to only read for your favorite classes or concoct a scheme to read 17 percent for each class and see how that works for you. You need to learn to skim, annotate, and take notes. All of these techniques will help you comprehend more of what you read, which is why we read in the first place. We&#x2019;ll talk more later about annotating and note-taking, but for now consider what you know about skimming as opposed to active reading.</p>

Effective skimming allows you to take in the major points of a passage without the need for a time-consuming reading session that involves your active use of notations and annotations. Often you will need to engage in that painstaking level of active reading, but skimming is the first step&#x2014;not an alternative to deep reading. The fact remains that neither do you need to read everything nor could you possibly accomplish that given your limited time. So learn this valuable skill of skimming as an accompaniment to your overall study tool kit, and with practice and experience, you will fully understand how valuable it is.</p>
            <p id="auto_a98de810-7051-4819-bc34-ed1ac1dfff06_para-00038" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:157:6">When you skim, look for guides to your understanding: headings, definitions, pull quotes, tables, and context clues. Textbooks are often helpful for skimming&#x2014;they may already have made some of these skimming guides in bold or a different color, and chapters often follow a predictable outline. Some even provide an overview and summary for sections or chapters. Use whatever you can get, but don&#x2019;t stop there. In textbooks that have some reading guides, or especially in texts that do not, look for introductory words such as <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:157:554">First</em> or <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:157:601">The purpose of this article</em>&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. or summary words such as <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:157:698">In conclusion</em>&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. or <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:157:759">Finally</em>. These guides will help you read only those sentences or paragraphs that will give you the overall meaning or gist of a passage or book.</p>
            <p id="auto_a98de810-7051-4819-bc34-ed1ac1dfff06_para-00039" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:158:6">Now move to the meat of the passage. You want to take in the reading as a whole. For a book, look at the titles of each chapter if available. Read each chapter&#x2019;s introductory paragraph and determine why the writer chose this particular order. Depending on what you&#x2019;re reading, the chapters may be only informational, but often you&#x2019;re looking for a specific argument. What position is the writer claiming? What support, counterarguments, and conclusions is the writer presenting?</p>

It is a skill you should master so you can engage, at various levels, with all the reading you need to accomplish in college. End your skimming session with a few notes&#x2014;terms to look up, questions you still have, and an overall summary. And recognize that you likely will return to that book or article for a more thorough reading if the material is useful.</p>

      One thing I wish I would have known before going to college is about how getting to know your classmates can be really beneficial, because you have someone to ask questions, form study groups, as well as talking about stress you may be experiencing in that class. Reading and notetaking was a big adjustment for me when I got to college, but being here I learned that reading the material is the thing that helps me the most. Obviously, reading textbooks isn't fun, but it&#x2019;s a must especially for your classes like biology and chemistry. For example, in my biology class, the chapters I need to read I take notes on the whole chapter then after taking my lecture notes I rewrite my notes combining the things that my professor put emphasis on. For notetaking it can be difficult to keep up with lectures so I record the lecture and after class I listen to my recording and write the things that I missed in lecture, and highlight the things that my professor said could be test material. If you are having trouble with reading and notetaking, ask your professor what you should do, don&#x2019;t be afraid to ask questions with your professor. I would also ask classmates around you, because you might learn a new way to write notes for your class. Lastly, don&#x2019;t be afraid to have different note taking techniques for each class, because sometimes it's needed. &#x2013;Alexys Shankle, sophomore

You can think of active reading as a sort of conversation between you and the text (maybe between you and the author, but you don&#x2019;t want to get the author&#x2019;s personality too involved in this metaphor because that may skew your engagement with the text).</p>

You should read textbook chapters and other reading assignments <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:168:376">before</em> you go into a lecture about that information. Don&#x2019;t wait to see how the lecture goes before you read the material, or you may not understand the information in the lecture. Reading before class helps you put ideas together between your reading and the information you hear and discuss in class.</p>

For example, you may look at a poem for your world literature class and assume that it will not take you long to read because it is relatively short compared to the dense textbook you have for your economics class. But reading and understanding a poem can take a considerable amount of time when you realize you may need to stop numerous times to review the separate word meanings and how the words form images and connections throughout the poem.</p>

You look for clues to meaning by reading the titles, headings, introductions, summary, captions for graphics, and keywords.

Ask yourself these questions separately. Try to create valid questions about what you are about to read that have come into your mind as you engaged in the Survey step.

You aren&#x2019;t likely to remember what these cryptic marks mean later when you come back to use this active reading session to study. The text is the source of information&#x2014;your marks and notes are just a way to organize and make sense of that information.</p>

            <p id="auto_a98de810-7051-4819-bc34-ed1ac1dfff06_para-00054" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:184:6">For example, if you were to read a secondary source that is examining the U.S. Declaration of Independence (the primary source), you would have a much clearer idea of how the secondary source scholar presented the information from the primary source if you also read the Declaration for yourself instead of trusting the other writer&#x2019;s interpretation. Most scholars are honest in writing secondary sources, but you as a reader of the source are trusting the writer to present a balanced perspective of the primary source. When possible, you should attempt to read a primary source in conjunction with the secondary source. The Internet helps immensely with this practice.</p>

If your selection is a book, flip it over or turn to the back pages and look for an author&#x2019;s biography or note from the author. See if the book itself contains any other information about the author or the subject matter.</p>

You can find these parts throughout the textbook chapter in the form of headings in larger and bold font, summary lists, and important quotations pulled out of the narrative. Use these features as you read to help you determine what the most important ideas are.</p>

Sometimes you can find a list of other books the author has written near the front of a book. Do you recognize any of the other titles? Can you do an Internet search for the name of the book or author? Go beyond the search results that want you to buy the book and see if you can glean any other relevant information about the author or the reading selection. Beyond a standard Internet search, try the library article database. These are more relevant to academic disciplines and contain resources you typically will not find in a standard search engine. If you are unfamiliar with how to use the library database, ask a reference librarian on campus. They are often underused resources that can point you in the right direction.</p>

She has read many books and watched numerous televised documentaries on this topic and actively seeks out additional information on the environment. While Laura&#x2019;s interest can help her understand a new reading encounter about the environment, Laura also has to be aware that with this interest, she brings forward her preset ideas and biases about the topic. Sometimes these prejudices against other ideas relate to religion or nationality or even just tradition. Without evidence, thinking the way we always have is not a good enough reason; evidence can change, and at the very least it needs honest review and assessment to determine its validity. Ironically, we may not want to learn new ideas because that may mean we would have to give up old ideas we have already mastered, which can be a daunting prospect.</p>
            <p id="auto_a98de810-7051-4819-bc34-ed1ac1dfff06_para-00059" data-sm="./modules/m00015/index.cnxml:197:6">With every reading situation about the environment, Laura needs to remain open-minded about what she is about to read and pay careful attention if she begins to ignore certain parts of the text because of her preconceived notions. Learning new information can be very difficult if you balk at ideas that are different from what you&#x2019;ve always thought. You may have to force yourself to listen to a different viewpoint multiple times to make sure you are not closing your mind to a viable solution your mindset does not currently allow.</p>

Taking notes also helps you stay focused on the question at hand. Taking notes during presentations or class lectures may allow you to follow the speaker&#x2019;s main points and condense the material into a more readily usable format. Strong notes build on your prior knowledge of a subject, help you discuss trends or patterns present in the information, and direct you toward areas needing further research or reading.</p>

Most of us don&#x2019;t have that court-reporter-esque skill level anyway, and if we try, we would end up missing valuable information. Learn to listen for main ideas and distinguish between these main ideas and details that typically support the ideas. Include examples that explain the main ideas, but do so using understandable abbreviations.</p>

In fact, if you only take notes without actively working on them after the initial note-taking session, the likelihood of the notes helping you is slim. Research on this topic concludes that without active engagement after taking notes, most students forget 60&#x2013;75 percent of material over which they took the notes&#x2014;within two days! That sort of defeats the purpose, don&#x2019;t you think? This information about memory loss was first brought to light by 19th-century German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus. Fortunately, you do have the power to thwart what is sometimes called the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve by reinforcing what you learned through review at intervals shortly after you take in the material and frequently thereafter.</p>

When you first attempt a difficult piece of music, you may not remember the chords and notes well at all, but after frequent practice and review, you generate a certain muscle memory and cognitive recall that allows you to play the music more easily.</p>
        <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00006" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:34:6">Note-taking may not be the most glamorous aspect of your higher-education journey, but it is a study practice you will carry throughout college and into your professional life. Setting yourself up for successful note-taking is almost as important as the actual taking of notes, and what you do after your note-taking session is equally significant. Well-written notes help you organize your thoughts, enhance your memory, and participate in class discussion, and they prepare you to respond successfully on exams. With all that riding on your notes, it would behoove you to learn how to take notes properly and continue to improve your note-taking skills.</p>

These understandably and reasonably vary from one situation to the next, but you can only improve your skills by learning more about ways to take effective notes and trying different methods to find a good fit.</p>
          <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00010" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:41:6">The very best notes are the ones you take in an organized manner that encourages frequent review and use as you progress through a topic or course of study. For this reason, you need to develop a way to organize all your notes for each class so they remain together and organized. As old-fashioned as it sounds, a clunky three-ring binder is an excellent organizational container for class notes. You can easily add to previous notes, insert handouts you may receive in class, and maintain a running collection of materials for each separate course. If the idea of carrying around a heavy binder has you rolling your eyes, then transfer that same structure into your computer files. If you don&#x2019;t organize your many documents into some semblance of order on your computer, you will waste significant time searching for improperly named or saved files.</p>

While individuals have strong personal opinions on this subject, most researchers agree that the format of student notes is less important than what students do with the notes they take afterwards. Both handwriting notes and using a computer for note-taking have pros and cons.</p>

The skill and art of note-taking is not automatic for anyone; it takes a great deal of practice, patience, and continuous attention to detail. Add to that the fact that you may need to master multiple note-taking techniques for different classes, and you have some work to do. Unless you are specifically directed by your instructor, you are free to combine the best parts of different systems if you are most comfortable with that hybrid system.</p>

Additional, optional information may be the number of note-taking sessions about this topic or reminders to cross-reference class handouts, textbook pages, or other course materials. It&#x2019;s also always a good idea to leave some blank space in your notes so you can insert additions and questions you may have as you review the material later.</p>

When you were in high school, this one-size-fits-all approach may have worked. Now that you&#x2019;re in college, reading and studying more advanced topics, your general method may still work some of the time, but you should have some different strategies in place if you find that your method isn&#x2019;t working as well with college content. You probably will need to adopt different note-taking strategies for different subjects. The strategies in this section represent various ways to take notes in such a way that you are able to study after the initial note-taking session.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:59:31">Cornell Method</h4>
            <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00015" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:60:6">One of the most recognizable note-taking systems is called the <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:60:91">Cornell Method</em>, a relatively simple way to take effective notes devised by Cornell University education professor Dr. Walter Pauk in the 1940s. In this system, you take a standard piece of note paper and divide it into three sections by drawing a horizontal line across your paper about one to two inches from the bottom of the page (the summary area) and then drawing a vertical line to separate the rest of the page above this bottom area, making the left side about two inches (the recall column) and leaving the biggest area to the right of your vertical line (the notes column). You may want to make one page and then copy as many pages as you think you&#x2019;ll need for any particular class, but one advantage of this system is that you can generate the sections quickly. Because you have divided up your page, you may end up using more paper than you would if you were writing on the entire page, but the point is not to keep your notes to as few pages as possible. The Cornell Method provides you with a well-organized set of notes that will help you study and review your notes as you move through the course. If you are taking notes on your computer, you can still use the Cornell Method in Word or Excel on your own or by using a template someone else created.</p>

Just write on one side of the page (the right-hand notes column)&#x2014;this will help later when you are reviewing and revising your notes. During your note-taking session, use the notes column to record information over the main points and concepts of the lecture; try to put the ideas into your own words, which will help you to not transcribe the speaker&#x2019;s words verbatim. Skip lines between each idea in this column.</p>
            <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00016a" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:66:6">Practice the shortcut abbreviations covered in the next section and avoid writing in complete sentences. Don&#x2019;t make your notes too cryptic, but you can use bullet points or phrases equally well to convey meaning&#x2014;we do it all the time in conversation. If you know you will need to expand the notes you are taking in class but don&#x2019;t have time, you can put reminders directly in the notes by adding and underlining the word <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:66:450">expand</em> by the ideas you need to develop more fully.</p>
            <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00017" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:67:6">As soon as possible after your note-taking session, preferably within eight hours but no more than twenty-four hours, read over your notes column and fill in any details you missed in class, including the places where you indicated you wanted to expand your notes. Then in the recall column, write any key ideas from the corresponding notes column&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t stuff this smaller recall column as if you&#x2019;re explaining or defining key ideas. Just add the one- or two-word main ideas; these words in the recall column serve as cues to help you remember the detailed information you recorded in the notes column.</p>
            <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00018" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:68:6">Once you are satisfied with your notes and recall columns, summarize this page of notes in two or three sentences using the summary area at the bottom of the sheet. This is an excellent time to get with another classmate or a group of students who all heard the same lecture to make sure you all understood the key points. Now, before you move onto something else, cover the large notes column, and quiz yourself over the key ideas you recorded in the recall column. Repeat this step often as you go along, not just immediately before an exam, and you will help your memory make the connections between your notes, your textbook reading, your in-class work, and assignments that you need to succeed on any quizzes and exams.</p>

The neat format helps you move into study-mode without needing to re-copy less organized notes or making sense of a large mass of information you aren&#x2019;t sure how to process because you can&#x2019;t remember key ideas or what you meant. If you write notes in your classes without any sort of system and later come across something like &#x201C;Napoleon&#x2014;short&#x201D; in the middle of a glob of notes, what can you do at this point? Is that important? Did it connect with something relevant from the lecture? How would you possibly know? You are your best advocate for setting yourself up for success in college.</p>

You can take notes in a formal outline if you prefer, using Roman numerals for each new topic, moving down a line to capital letters indented a few spaces to the right for concepts related to the previous topic, then adding details to support the concepts indented a few more spaces over and denoted by an Arabic numeral. You can continue to add to a formal outline by following these rules.</p>
            <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00021" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:77:6">You don&#x2019;t absolutely have to use the formal numerals and letter, but you have to then be careful to indent so you can tell when you move from a higher level topic to the related concepts and then to the supporting information. The main benefit of an outline is how organized it is. You have to be on your toes when you are taking notes in class to ensure you keep up the organizational format of the outline, which can be tricky if the lecture or presentation is moving quickly or covering many diverse topics.</p>

Just as you cannot read all the many books, articles, and documents you need to peruse for your college classes, you cannot remember the most important ideas of all the notes you will take as part of your courses, so you must review.</p>

Variations of this method abound, so you may want to look for more versions online, but the basic principles are that you are making connections between main ideas through a graphic depiction; some can get rather elaborate with colors and shapes, but a simple version may be more useful at least to begin. Main ideas can be circled or placed in a box with supporting concepts radiating off these ideas shown with a connecting line and possibly details of the support further radiating off the concepts. You can present your main ideas vertically or horizontally, but turning your paper long-ways, or in landscape mode, may prove helpful as you add more main ideas.</p>

Sometimes when you can&#x2019;t come up with the exact wording to explain something or you&#x2019;re trying to add information for complex ideas in your notes, sketching a rough image of the idea can help you remember. According to educator Sherrill Knezel in an article entitled &#x201C;The Power of Visual Note-taking,&#x201D; this strategy is effective because &#x201C;When students use images and text in note-taking, it gives them two different ways to pull up the information, doubling their chances of recall.&#x201D; Don&#x2019;t shy away from this creative approach to note-taking just because you believe you aren&#x2019;t an artist; the images don&#x2019;t need to be perfect.

That almost-lost art in the age of computers could come in very handy during intense note-taking sessions. Elaborate shorthand systems do exist, but you would be better served in your college note-taking adventures to hone a more familiar, personalized form of shorthand to help you write more in a shorter amount of time. Seemingly insignificant shortcuts can add up to ease the stress note-taking can induce&#x2014;especially if you ever encounter an &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going to repeat this&#x201D; kind of presenter!

Whether you are highlighting, underlining, or adding additional notes, you are reinforcing the material in your mind and memory.</p>
          <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00033" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:194:6">Admit it&#x2014;who can resist highlighting markers? Gone are the days when yellow was the star of the show, and you had to be very careful not to press too firmly for fear of obliterating the words you were attempting to emphasize. Students now have a veritable rainbow of highlighting options and can color-code notes and text passages to their hearts&#x2019; content.</p>
          <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00034" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:195:6">The only reason to highlight anything is to draw attention to it, so you can easily pick out that ever-so-important information later for further study or reflection. One problem many students have is not knowing when to stop. If what you need to recall from the passage is a particularly apt and succinct definition of the term important to your discipline, highlighting the entire paragraph is less effective than highlighting just the actual term. And if you don&#x2019;t rein in this tendency to color long passages (possibly in multiple colors) you can end up with a whole page of highlighted text. Ironically, that is no different from a page that is not highlighted at all, so you have wasted your time. Your mantra for highlighting text should be&#xA0;<em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:195:776">less is more</em>. Always read your text selection first before you start highlighting anything. You need to know what the overall message is before you start placing emphasis in the text with highlighting.</p>
          <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00035" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:196:6">Another way to annotate notes after initial note-taking is underlining significant words or passages. Albeit not quite as much fun as its colorful cousin highlighting, underlining provides precision to your emphasis.</p>
          <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00036" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:197:6">Some people think of annotations as only using a colored highlighter to mark certain words or phrases for emphasis. Actually, annotations can refer to anything you do with a text to enhance it for your particular use (either a printed text, handwritten notes, or other sort of document you are using to learn concepts). The annotations may include highlighting passages or vocabulary, defining those unfamiliar terms once you look them up, writing questions in the margin of a book, underlining or circling key terms, or otherwise marking a text for future reference. You can also annotate some electronic texts.</p>
          <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00037" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:198:6">Realistically, you may end up doing all of these types of annotations at different times. We know that repetition in studying and reviewing is critical to learning, so you may come back to the same passage and annotate it separately. These various markings can be invaluable to you as a study guide and as a way to see the evolution of your learning about a topic. If you regularly begin a reading session writing down any questions you may have about the topic of that chapter or section and also write out answers to those questions at the end of the reading selection, you will have a good start to what that chapter covered when you eventually need to study for an exam. At that point, you likely will not have time to reread the entire selection especially if it is a long reading selection, but with strong annotations in conjunction with your class notes, you won&#x2019;t need to do that. With experience in reading discipline-specific texts and writing essays or taking exams in that field, you will know better what sort of questions to ask in your annotations.</p>

Be judicious about what you annotate and how you do it on the page, which means you must be neat about it. Otherwise, you end up with a mess of either color or symbols combined with some cryptic notes that probably took you quite a long time to create, but won&#x2019;t be worth as much to you as a study aid as they could be. This is simply a waste of time and effort.</p>

If you are lucky enough to have a blank page next to the beginning of the chapter or section you are annotating, use this, but keep in mind that when you start writing notes, you aren&#x2019;t exactly sure how much space you&#x2019;ll need. Use a decipherable shorthand and write only what you need to convey the meaning in very small print. If you are annotating your own notes, you can make a habit of using only one side of the paper in class, so that if you need to add more notes later, you could use the other side. You can also add a blank page to your notes before beginning the next class date in your notebook so you&#x2019;ll end up with extra paper for annotations when you study.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:210:31">Providing Needed Additional Explanations to Notes</h4>
            <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00041" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:211:6">Consider this scenario: Marlon was totally organized and ready to take notes in a designated course notebook at the beginning of every philosophy class session. He always dated his page and indicated what the topic of discussion was. He had various colored highlighters ready to denote the different note purposes he had defined: vocabulary in pink, confusing concepts in green, and note sections that would need additional explanations later in yellow. He also used his own shorthand and an impressive array of symbols to indicate questions (red question mark), highly probable test material (he used a tiny bomb exploding here), additional reading suggestions, and specific topics he would ask his instructor before the next class. Doing everything so precisely, Marlon&#x2019;s methods seemed like a perfect example of how to take notes for success. Inevitably though, by the end of the hour-and-a-half class session, Marlon was frantically switching between writing tools, near to tears, and scouring his notes as waves of yellow teased him with uncertainty. What went wrong?</p>
            <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00042" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:212:6">As with many of us who try diligently to do everything we know how to do for success or what we think we know because we read books and articles on success in between our course work, Marlon is suffering from trying to do too much simultaneously. It&#x2019;s an honest mistake we can make when we are trying to save a little time or think we can multitask and kill two birds with one stone.</p>
            <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00043" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:213:6">Unfortunately, this particular error in judgment can add to your stress level exponentially if you don&#x2019;t step back and see it for what it is. Marlon attempted to take notes in class as well as annotate his notes to get them ready for his test preparation. It was too much to do at one time, but even if he could have done all those things during class, he&#x2019;s missing one critical point about note-taking.</p>
            <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00044" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:214:6">As much as we may want to hurry and get it over with, note-taking in class is just the beginning. Your instructor likely gave you a pre-class assignment to read or complete before coming to that session. The intention of that preparatory lesson is for you to come in with some level of familiarity for the topic under consideration and questions of your own. Once you&#x2019;re in class, you may also need to participate in a group discussion, work with your classmates, or perform some other sort of lesson-directed activity that would necessarily take you away from taking notes. Does that mean you should ignore taking notes for that day? Most likely not. You may just need to indicate in your notes that you worked on a project or whatever other in-class event you experienced that date.</p>
            <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00045" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:215:6">Very rarely in a college classroom will you engage in an activity that is not directly related to what you are studying in that course. Even if you enjoyed every minute of the class session and it was an unusual format for that course, you still need to take some notes. Maybe your first note could be to ask yourself why you think the instructor used that unique teaching strategy for the class that day. Was it effective? Was it worth using the whole class time? How will that experience enhance what you are learning in that course?</p>
            <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00046" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:216:6">If you use an ereader or ebooks to read texts for class or read articles from the Internet on your laptop or tablet, you can still take effective notes. Depending on the features of your device, you have many choices. Almost all electronic reading platforms allow readers to highlight and underline text. Some devices allow you to add a written text in addition to marking a word or passage that you can collect at the end of your note-taking session. Look into the specific tools for your device and learn how to use the features that allow you to take notes electronically. You can also find apps on devices to help with taking notes, some of which you may automatically have installed when you buy the product. Microsoft&#x2019;s OneNote, Google Keep, and the Notes feature on phones are relatively easy to use, and you may already have free access to those.</p>

Just as you may generate questions as you&#x2019;re reading new material, you may leave a class session or lecture or activities with many questions. Write those down in a place where they won&#x2019;t get lost in all your other notes.</p>

A good starting place that is also easy to remember is to make every effort to review your notes within 24 hours of first taking them. Longer than that and you are likely to have forgotten some key features you need to include; must less time than that, and you may not think you need to review the information you so recently wrote down, and you may postpone the task too long.</p>

They should enhance how you understand the lessons, textbooks, lab sessions, and assignments. All the time and effort you put into first taking the notes and then annotating and organizing the notes will be for naught if you do not formulate an effective and efficient way to use them before sectional exams or comprehensive tests.</p>

Don&#x2019;t try to take short cuts; recognize each step in the cycle as a building block. Learning doesn&#x2019;t end, which shouldn&#x2019;t fill you with dread; it should help you recognize that all this work you&#x2019;re doing in the classroom and during your own study and review sessions is ongoing and cumulative. Practicing effective strategies now will help you be a stronger professional.</p>

The expectation in college is that you read considerable amounts of text for each subject with the goal of learning more about the subjects. You may encounter reading situations, such as professional journal articles and long textbook chapters, that are more difficult to understand than texts you have read previously. As you progress through your college courses, you can employ reading strategies to help you complete your college reading assignments. Likewise, you will take notes in college that need to be complete so you can study and recall the information you learn in lectures and lab sessions. With so much significant information that you need to collect, study, and recall for your college courses, you need to be deliberate in your reading and note-taking.</p>
          <p id="auto_d58cf531-dff1-4a41-a1cb-1a4d9088befc_para-00057" data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:304:6">Honing these fundamental skills can only help you succeed in college and beyond because you will need to be able to take in and recall a vast amount of information. To that end, consider what else about reading and note-taking you would like to learn or practice. Choose one of the following to explore further this term:</p>

            <li data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:306:6">Develop more curiosity about what you are reading by creating questions about what you will learn or how you will use the information. Look for articles, blog posts, podcasts, books, and films about what you are learning to help you develop more knowledge.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:307:6">Explore the best reading strategy for your most challenging courses. Choose one of them, use it, and determine how well it worked.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00016/index.cnxml:308:6">Practice revising reading and lecture notes as part of organizing your study materials and developing a deeper understanding of the content. Check the results of this reorganization the next time you take a quiz or test.</li>

One of the best strategies is to test yourself over the material. This will help you improve your retrieval strength and help you remember more when it comes to the test. I also learned about reviewing your graded tests. This will help you see where you went wrong and why. Being able to see your mistakes and correct them helps the storage and retrieval strength as well as building those dendrites. Getting a question wrong will only improve those things helping you remember the next time it comes up.&#x201D;</p>

However, deep learning doesn&#x2019;t happen overnight. After you have read the texts and listened to the lectures, you will want to participate in activities that help you move your understanding from your short-term memory to your long-term memory. And there is only one way to learn deeply: through effective study practices and test taking in which you receive feedback on how well you have learned.</p>

And the more experience you have using your study and memorization skills and employing success strategies during exams, the better you&#x2019;ll get at it. But you have to keep it up&#x2014;maintaining these skills and learning better strategies as the content you study becomes increasingly complex is crucial to your success. Once you transition into a work environment, you will be able to use these same skills that helped you to be successful in college as you face the problem-solving demands and expectations of your job. Earning high grades is one goal, and certainly a good one when you&#x2019;re in college, but true learning means committing content to long-term memory.</p>

Encoding is how we first perceive information through our senses, such as when we smell a lovely flower or a putrid trash bin. Both make an impression on our minds through our sense of smell and probably our vision. Our brains encode, or label, this content in short-term memory in case we want to think about it again.</p>

For example, nursing student Marilyn needs to use her knowledge of chemical reactions to suggest appropriate prescriptions in various medical case studies. She does not have to recall every single fact she learned in years of chemistry classes, but she does need to have a working memory of certain chemicals and how they work with others. To ensure she can make these connections, Marilyn will have to review and study the relevant chemical details for the types of drug interactions she will recommend in the case studies.</p>

For instance, when you begin to study an assignment, you certainly need to read the directions, but you must also remember that in class your professor reduced the number of problem sets the written instructions indicated you needed to finish. This was an oral addition to the written assignment. The change to the instructions is what you bring up in working memory when you complete the assignment.</p>

It helps us remember where we set our keys or where we left off on a project the day before. Think about all the aids we employ to help us with short-term memory: you may hang your keys in a particular place each evening so you know exactly where they are supposed to be. When you go grocery shopping, do you ever choose a product because you recall an advertising jingle? You see the box of cereal and you remember the song on the TV commercial. If that memory causes you to buy that product, the advertising worked. We help our memory along all the time, which is perfectly fine. In fact, we can modify these everyday examples of memory assistance for purposes of studying and test taking. The key is a deliberate use of strategies that are not so elaborate that they are too difficult to remember in our short-term memory.</p>

To combat this limitation, we clump information together, making connections to help us stretch our capacity to remember. Many factors play into how much we can remember and how we do it, including the subject matter, how familiar we are with the ideas, and how interested we are in the topic, but we certainly cannot remember absolutely everything, for a test or any other task we face. As such, we have to use effective strategies, like those we cover later in this chapter, to get the most out of our memories.</p>

If we want these fleeting ideas to transfer into long-term memory, we have to do some work, such as causing frequent exposure to the information over time (such as studying the terms every day for a period of time or the repetition you performed to memorize multiplication tables or spelling rules) and some relevant manipulation of the information.</p>

Preston continues, &#x201C;Initially, the hippocampus works in concert with sensory-processing regions distributed in the neocortex (the outermost layer of the brain) to form the new memories. Within the neocortex, representations of the elements that constitute an event in our life are distributed across multiple brain regions according to their content. . . .When a memory is first formed, the hippocampus rapidly combines this distributed information into a single memory, thus acting as an index of representations in the sensory-processing regions. As time passes, cellular and molecular changes allow for the strengthening of direct connections among the neocortical regions, enabling access to the memory independent of the hippocampus.&#x201D;</p>

That alone may not be enough to get that song into the coveted long-term memory area of our brain, but if we have an emotional connection to the song, such as a painful breakup or a life-changing event that occurred while we were listening to the song, this may help. Think of ways to make your study session memorable and create connections with the information you need to study. That way, you have a better chance of keeping your study material in your memory so you can access it whenever you need it.</p>

All that reading, all those papers, all those extra hours in the science lab or tutoring center or library! And then we have the social and emotional aspects of going to school, which may not be the most critical aspect of your life as you pursue more education but are a significant part of who you are. When you consider everything you need to attend to in college, you probably won&#x2019;t be surprised that sleep is often the first thing we give up as we search for more time to accomplish everything we&#x2019;re trying to do. That seems reasonable&#x2014;just wake up an hour earlier or stay up a little later. But you may want to reconsider picking away at your precious sleep time.</p>

You probably can recall times when you had to do something without adequate sleep. We say things like &#x201C;I just can&#x2019;t wake up&#x201D; and &#x201C;I&#x2019;m walking around half asleep.&#x201D;</p>

Lack of sleep impairs judgment, focus, and our overall mood. Do you know anyone who is always grumpy in the morning? A fascinating medical study from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) claims that sleep deprivation is as dangerous as being drunk, both in what it does to our bodies and in the harm we may cause to ourselves and others in driving and performing various daily tasks.<a href="#auto_7ecb4c9f-7bc0-43f4-b9ae-20b97b2a1b41_ch04rfin-5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">5</a> <a href="#auto_7ecb4c9f-7bc0-43f4-b9ae-20b97b2a1b41_ch04rfin-6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">6</a></p>

Most exams in a college setting go beyond simple memorization, but you still have a lot to remember for exams. For example, when Saanvi sits down to take an exam on introductory biology, she needs to recall all the subject-specific vocabulary she read in the textbook&#x2019;s opening chapters, the general connections she made between biological studies and other scientific fields, and any biology details introduced in the unit for which she is taking the exam.</p>

She isn&#x2019;t merely tired; her brain is not refreshed and primed to conduct difficult tasks. Although not an exact comparison, think about when you overtax a computer by opening too many programs simultaneously. Sometimes the programs are sluggish or slow to respond, making it difficult to work efficiently; sometimes the computer shuts down completely and you have to reboot the entire system. Your body is a bit like that on too little sleep.</p>

The exact reasons for this is still a serious research project for scientists, but the results all point to a solid connection between sleep and cognitive performance.</p>

She isn&#x2019;t worried because she has set aside time she would have spent sleeping to cram just before the exam. That&#x2019;s the idea anyway. Originally, she planned to stay up a little late and study for four hours from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. and still get several hours of refreshing sleep. But it&#x2019;s Dolphin Week or Beat State Day or whatever else comes up, and her study session doesn&#x2019;t start until midnight&#x2014;she&#x2019;ll pull an <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00019/index.cnxml:130:821">all-nighter</em> (to be more precise, this is actually an <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00019/index.cnxml:130:912">all-really-early- morning-er,</em> but it doesn&#x2019;t quite have the same ring to it).

That doesn&#x2019;t mean you can&#x2019;t focus for longer than 10 minutes; you just have to switch gears a lot to keep your brain engaged. Have you ever heard a speaker drone on about one concept for, say, 30 minutes without somehow changing pace to engage the listeners? It doesn&#x2019;t take much to re-engage&#x2014;pausing to ask the listeners questions or moving to a different location in the room will do it&#x2014;but without these subtle attention markers, listeners start thinking of something else. The same thing happens to you if you try to cram all reading, problem-solving, and note reviewing into one long session; your brain will wander.</p>

For instance, if you are expected to have a working knowledge of conversational French or Spanish, you will have to memorize some words. Simply knowing a long list of terms isn&#x2019;t going to help you order food in a caf&#xE9; or ask for directions in a foreign country because you also need to understand the other language&#x2019;s grammar and have some sort of context for what needs to be said from your vocabulary list. But you cannot say the words in a different language if you cannot remember your vocabulary. From this scenario, you can assume that memorization is a good fit for some parts of language acquisition.</p>

Two major and interrelated techniques involve avoiding distractions to the best of your ability and creating a study environment that works to help you concentrate.</p>

That may seem extreme, but sometimes vacuuming is the preferred activity to buckling down and working through calculus problems! Cell phones, tablets, and portable computers that literally bring a world of possibilities to us anywhere have brought <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:31:461">distraction</em> to an entirely new level. When was the last time you were with a large group of people when you didn&#x2019;t see at least a few people on devices?</p>

And letting go of that connection to our friends and the larger world, even for a short amount of time, can be difficult. Perhaps the least stressful way to allow yourself a distraction-free environment is to make the study session a definite amount of time: long enough to get a significant amount of studying accomplished but short enough to hold your attention.</p>
            <p id="auto_b8011ec7-79a2-459a-88da-d894a79a9a94_para-00005" data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:37:5">You can increase that attention time with practice and focus. Pretend it is a professional appointment or meeting during which you cannot check e-mail or texts or otherwise engage with your portable devices. We have all become very attached to the ability to check in&#x2014;anonymously on social media or with family and friends via text, chat, and calls. If you set a specific amount of time to study without interruptions, you can convince your wandering mind that you will soon be able to return to your link to the outside world. Start small and set an alarm&#x2014;a 30-minute period to review notes, then a brief break, then another 45-minute study session to quiz yourself on the material, and so on.</p>

              <li data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:40:5">Put your phone out of sight&#x2014;in another room or at least some place where you will not see or hear it vibrate or ring. Just flipping it over is not enough.</li>
              <li data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:41:5">Turn off the television or music (more on that in the next section).</li>
              <li data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:42:5">Unless you are deliberately working with a study group, study somewhere alone if possible, or at least far enough away from others to not hear them talking.</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="auto_b8011ec7-79a2-459a-88da-d894a79a9a94_para-00007" data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:44:5">If you live with lots of other people or don&#x2019;t have access to much privacy, see if you can negotiate some space alone to study. Ask others to leave one part of the house or an area in one room as a quiet zone during certain hours. Ask politely for a specific block of time; most people will respect your educational goals and be willing to accommodate you. If you&#x2019;re trying to work out quiet zones with small children in the house, the bathtub with a pillow can make a fine study oasis.</p>

And if you have a long deadline, maybe you can blow off a study session on occasion, but you shouldn&#x2019;t get into the habit of ignoring a strong study routine. Jane Austen once wrote in a letter, &#x201C;I am not at all in a humor for writing; I must write on till I am.&#x201D; Sometimes just starting is the hard part; go ahead and begin. Don&#x2019;t wait around for your study muse; start working, and she&#x2019;ll show up.</p>
            <p id="auto_b8011ec7-79a2-459a-88da-d894a79a9a94_para-00009" data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:49:5">Sometimes you just need to plop down and study whenever and wherever you can manage&#x2014;in the car waiting for someone, on the bus, at the Little League field as you cheer on your shortstop. And that&#x2019;s okay if this is the exception. For long-term success in studying, though, you need a better study setting that will help you get the most out of your limited study time. Whatever your space limitations, carve out a place that you can dedicate to reading, writing, note-taking, and reviewing. This doesn&#x2019;t need to be elaborate and expensive&#x2014;all you truly need is a flat surface large enough to hold either your computer or writing paper, book or notes, pens/pencils/ markers, and subject-specific materials you may need (e.g., stand-alone calculators, drawing tools, and notepads). Your space should be cool or warm enough for you to be comfortable as you study. What do you have now that you consider your study space? Is it set up for your optimal success?</p>

For example, Martina thought setting up her study station on the dining room table was a good idea at first. The view was calming, and the table was big enough to spread out and could even hold all her materials to study architectural drawings, her favorite subject. But then she needed the table for a small family dinner party, so she had to find a cubbyhole to hide away her supplies with some needing to go into a closet in the next room. Now she was spread out over multiple study spaces. And the family TV was in an adjacent room, not visible from the table but certainly an auditory distraction. Martina ultimately decided to forgo her view and create a smaller station in an unused bedroom so she could leave her supplies out and have a quieter area. You may have to try out numerous places to determine what works best for you. In fact, if you have a few comfortable places to study, such as the library, a coffee shop, and your room, you will increase your ability to recall the information you are studying because these different environments will help you encode the information you are studying in multiple ways. The belief that you must study in the same place and in the same way is a myth: Varying your study spaces and your study strategies can help you encode, store, and retrieve the information more effectively.</p>

You should include the basics: a good chair, a work surface, and whatever materials, books, notes, and other supplies you need for the subject you are studying.</p>

Watch TV while you write out a grocery list? Listen to music while you cook dinner? What about type an e-mail while you&#x2019;re on the phone with someone else and jot down notes about the call? The common term for this attempt to do more than one thing at a time is multitasking, and almost everyone does it at some point. On some days, you simply cannot accomplish all that you want to get done, so you double up. The problem is, multitasking doesn&#x2019;t really work. Of course, it exists, and we do it. For instance, we walk and chew gum or drive and talk, but we are not really thinking about two or more distinct things or doing multiple processes simultaneously. You are far more likely to miss important details, and far less likely to retain information, if you try to multitask when studying.</p>

If you allow it to take up all your time, you may think you are fully prepared for an exam because you put in the time. Actually, you need much more time reviewing and retrieving your lessons and ideas from the text or class lecture as well as quizzing yourself to accomplish your goal of learning so you can perform well on the exam. Highlighting is a task you can do rather easily, and it makes you feel good because you are actively engaging with your text, but true learning needs more steps.</p>

You can make the most of the memory you have by making some conscious decisions about how you study and prepare for exams. Incorporate these ideas into your study sessions:</p>

Really whatever works for you to recall information is a good tool to have. You can create your own quizzes and tests to go over material from class. You can use mnemonics to jog your memory. You can work in groups to develop unique ways to remember complex information. Whatever methods you choose to enhance your memory, keep in mind that repetition is one of the most effective tools in any memory strategy. Do whatever you do over and over for the best results.</p>

After you&#x2019;ve worked in that discipline for a while, you likely don&#x2019;t need the mnemonics, but you probably won&#x2019;t forget them either.</p>

In addition to acronyms, here are a few that college students have used to help them recall.</p>

They work best for remembering steps in a process. For example, &#x201C;Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally&#x201D; is an acrostic sentence for the steps in the order of operations when solving an equation. Each word starts with a letter that corresponds to another word in the steps: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.</li>

For example, you may need to remember the countries in Africa and could organize them by relative size, location (north, south, etc.), or letter they begin with.</li>

The memory palace, also called a Roman Room or the loci method, requires you to think of a physical space, real or imagined, in which you can &#x201C;place&#x201D; items you need to recall within that location. For example, if you are thinking of your own bedroom as the space and you need to remember the parts of speech, you may place &#x201C;verb&#x201D; in front of the door to your room as you will need to use an action to open it up. Then, your bed may be where you place &#x201C;noun&#x201D; because it is where you add actions such as <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:109:786">sleep</em>, <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:109:831">read, and daydream</em>.

It shows a highly intelligent ability to make sense of the world when you can associate like and even somewhat unlike components. If, for instance, you were reading Martin Luther King Jr.&#x2019;s &#x201C;Letter from a Birmingham Jail,&#x201D; and you read the line that he had been in Birmingham, you may remember a trip you took with your family last summer through Alabama and that you passed by and visited the civil rights museum in Birmingham. This may remind you of the different displays you saw and the discussions you had with your family about what had happened concerning civil rights in the 1950s, &#x2019;60s, and &#x2019;70s in the United States.</p>

The connection is fine, but you can&#x2019;t get lost in going down rabbit holes that may or may not be what you&#x2019;re supposed to be doing at the time. Make a folder for this assignment where you can put things such as a short summary of your trip to Alabama. You may eventually include notes from this summary in your analysis. You may include something from a website that shows you information about that time period. Additionally, you could include items about Martin Luther King Jr.&#x2019;s life and death and his work for civil rights. All of these elements may help you understand the significance of this one letter, but you need to be cognizant of what you&#x2019;re doing at the time and remember it is not usually a good idea to just try to keep it all in your head. The best idea is to have a way to access this information easily, either electronically or in hard copy, so that if you are able to use it, you can find it easily and quickly.</p>

For example, Andrea is an avid knitter and remembers how to create complicated stitches by associating them with nursery rhymes she read as a child. A delicate stitch that requires concentration because it makes the yarn look like part of it is hiding brings to mind Red Riding Hood, and connecting it to that character helps Andrea recall the exact order of steps necessary to execute the design. You can do the same thing with song lyrics, lines from movies, or favorite stories where you draw a connection to the well-known phrase or song and the task you need to complete.</p>

Research on memory suggests that giving yourself time in between study sessions actually helps you forget the information. And forgetting, which sounds like it would be something you <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:144:292">don&#x2019;t</em> want to do, is actually good for your ability to remember information long-term.

The table below demonstrates how <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_b8011ec7-79a2-459a-88da-d894a79a9a94_term-00002" data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:144:600" group-by="s">spacing</span> works.

Notice that interleaving includes revisiting material from a previous chapter or unit or revisiting different types of problems or question sets. The benefit is that your brain is &#x201C;mixing up&#x201D; the information, which can sometimes lead to short-term forgetting but can lead to long-term memory and learning.</p>

One is to test yourself as you are reading or taking in information. This is a great way to add a little variety to your studying. You can ask yourself what a paragraph or text section means as you read. To do this, read a passage in a text, cover up the material, and ask yourself, &#x201C;What was the main idea of this section?&#x201D; Recite aloud or write down your answer, and then check it against the original information.</p>

This takes more time, but there are online programs such as Quizlet that make it a little easier. Practice testing is an effective study strategy because it helps you practice <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:199:358">retrieving</em> information, which is what you want to be able to do when you are taking the real test.</p>

You may find you know more about the subject than you thought or you may realize quickly that you need to do more studying. Why does teaching someone else rank as one of the most effective ways to learn something? It is a form of practice testing that requires you to demonstrate you know something in front of someone else! No one wants to look like they don&#x2019;t know what they are talking about, even if your audience is another classmate.</p>

They may fall over and feel insecure, but usually, they learn to make the machine go. Most of us employ multiple methods of study all the time. You usually only run into trouble if you stubbornly rely on just one way to learn or study and the material you&#x2019;re studying or the task you want to accomplish doesn&#x2019;t lend itself to that preference. You can practice specific strategies to help you learn in your preferred learning approach. Can you think of a time when the way you usually study a situation didn&#x2019;t work?</p>
            <p id="auto_b8011ec7-79a2-459a-88da-d894a79a9a94_para-00055" data-sm="./modules/m00020/index.cnxml:206:5">When deciding on a study approach, consider what you know about the material and the type of knowledge it involves. Is it a group of concepts related to problem-solving methods, such as those you&#x2019;d find in a physics class? Or is it a literary analysis of a novel? Consider as many elements as possible about the material -- and the way the material will be assessed -- to help choose a study approach.</p>

Watch the way they teach lessons or convey necessary course information to the class. Do they almost always augment lessons with video clips to provide examples or create a memorable narrative? Do they like to show you how something works by demonstrating and working with their hands&#x2014;for instance, assembling a piece of equipment by taking it apart and putting it back together again? Echoing their teaching approach may help your studying approach. That doesn&#x2019;t mean you have to change your entire learning approach to match your instructors&#x2019; methods. Many instructors understand that their students will have different ways of learning and try to present information in multiple ways.</p>

      Something I wished I knew before going to college is how to properly set aside time dedicated towards studying. If you learn how to manage the material you are studying by breaking it down into manageable chunks, you can avoid last-minute cramming and be put in stressful situations during the test. Procrastination is one of your worst enemies when it comes to studying and proper time management not only can assist you when it comes to ensuring you are properly prepared for a test but also allows you free up your time to relax on weekends, so you are not having to work on school all week long. I have learned that studying effectively is more than just memorizing the material. It is important to actively engage with the material, whether that is in the form of practice problems, creating flashcards, or studying in a group. This allows me to retain the information I am learning so it's not just dumped, and I may use it again in the future. If you are struggling with studying and taking tests, remember that everyone learns differently and what works best for one person may be different for you. Do not be afraid to experiment with different study methods or reaching out to college resources, like tutors. Also, make sure to maintain your mental health by getting plenty of sleep, eating well, and taking plenty of study breaks. &#x2013;Ethan Meyer, senior

You don&#x2019;t need all of your study time to exactly replicate the test, but you would be well served to find out the format of the exam in advance and practice the skills you&#x2019;ll need to use for the various test components. Consider this scenario: On one early exam in history, Stuart learned the prof was going to include several short-answer essay questions&#x2014;one for each year of the time period covered. Stuart set up practice times to write for about 15 to 20 minutes on significant events from his notes because he estimated that would be about how much time he could devote out of the hour-long testing session to write one or two required short-answer questions. He would write a prompt from his notes, set a timer, and start writing. If you&#x2019;re ready and you have practiced and know the material, 20 minutes is adequate to prepare, draft, and revise a short response, but you don&#x2019;t have a lot of extra time.</p>

If you are able to incorporate this sort of timed problem-solving into your study time, you&#x2019;ll be more prepared and confident when you actually come to the exam. Making yourself adhere to a timed session during your study can only help. It puts a sense of urgency on you, and it will help you to find out what types of problems you need to practice more than ones that perhaps you&#x2019;re more comfortable solving.</p>

Perhaps that&#x2019;s somewhat annoying, but that&#x2019;s reality. Allergies still flare up, children still need to eat, and you still need to sleep. You must see your academic life as one segment of who you are&#x2014;it&#x2019;s an important segment, but just one aspect of who you are as a whole person. Consider this example: Neela tries to turn off everything else when she has exams coming up in her nursing program, which is pretty often. She ignores her health, puts off her family, tries to reschedule competing work tasks, and focuses all her energy on the pending exam. On the surface, that sounds like a reasonable approach, but if she becomes really sick by ignoring a minor head cold, or if she misses an important school deadline for one of her children, Neela risks making matters worse by attempting to compartmentalize so strictly. Taking care of her own health by eating and sleeping properly; asking for help in other aspects of her busy life, such as attending to the needs of her children; and seeing the big picture of how it all fits together would be a better approach. Pretending otherwise may work sporadically, but it is not sustainable for the long run.</p>

Or paint a masterpiece if you&#x2019;ve never tried to work with paints and brushes? Probably not. But often we expect ourselves to perform at much higher levels of achievement than that for which we&#x2019;ve actually prepared. If you become very upset and stressed if you make any score lower than the highest, you probably need to reevaluate your own expectations for test situations. Striving to always do your best is an admirable goal. Realistically knowing that your current <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00021/index.cnxml:52:574">best</em> may not achieve the highest academic ratings can help you plot your progress.</p>

They simply quit. This doesn&#x2019;t mean you settle for mediocre grades or refrain from your challenges. It means you become increasingly aware of yourself and your current state and potential future. Know yourself, know your strengths and weaknesses, and be honest with yourself about your expectations.</p>

Testing accommodations may allow for additional time on the test, the use of a scribe to record exam answers, the use of a computer instead of handwriting answers, as well as other means to make the test situation successful.

For example, instructors often offer options&#x2014;so you may have four short-answer questions from which to choose, but you only need to answer two of them. If you had not read the directions for that section, you may have thought you needed to provide answers to all four prompts. Working on extra questions for which you likely will receive no credit would be a waste of your limited exam time. The extra time you spend at the beginning is like an investment in your overall results.</p>

Then you can go back and concentrate on those skipped ones later after you have answered the majority of the questions confidently. Sometimes a later question will trigger an idea in your mind that will help you answer the skipped questions.</p>

Finally, <strong data-sm="./modules/m00021/index.cnxml:97:529">make sure you have completed the entire test:</strong> check the backs of pages, and verify that you have a corresponding answer section for every question section on the exam.

You probably have numerous other assignments, projects, and life obligations to attend to, especially if you pushed some of those off to study for this completed exam. Give yourself some space from this exam, but only for the duration of the time when your instructor is grading your exam. Once you have your results, study them&#x2014;whether you did really well (Go, you!) or not as well as you had hoped (Keep your spirits up!). Both scenarios hold valuable information if you will use it.</p>
            <p id="auto_e8f40b3e-43f6-4f6f-a1b4-35d0bb4eac89_para-00031" data-sm="./modules/m00021/index.cnxml:101:5">Consider this example: Thandie had a habit of going all-out for exams before she took them, and she did pretty well usually, but once the instructor passed back the graded tests, she would look at the letter grade, glance half-heartedly at the instructor&#x2019;s comments, and toss the exam away, ready to move on to the next chapter, section, or concept. A better plan would be to learn from her exam results and analyze both what she did well and where she struggled. After a particularly unimpressive exam outing in her statistics class, Thandie took her crumpled-up exam to the campus tutoring center, where the tutor reviewed the test with her section by section. Together they discovered that Thandie did particularly well on the computational sections, which she admitted were her favorites, and not well at all on the short-answer essay questions that she did not expect to find in a stats class, which in her experience had been more geared toward the mathematical side of solving statistical problems.</p>
            <p id="auto_e8f40b3e-43f6-4f6f-a1b4-35d0bb4eac89_para-00032" data-sm="./modules/m00021/index.cnxml:102:5">Going forward in this class, Thandie should practice writing out her explanations of how to compute the problems and talk to her instructor about ways to hone this skill. This tutoring session also proved to Thandie the benefit of holding on to important class papers&#x2014;either electronically or in hard copy, depending on the class setup&#x2014;for future reference. For some classes, you probably don&#x2019;t need to keep every scrap of paper (or file) associated with your notes, exams, assignments, and projects, but for others, especially for those in your major, those early class materials may come in very handy in your more difficult later undergraduate courses or even in grad school when you need a quick refresher on the basic concepts.</p>

You may know this firsthand. Almost everyone gets a little nervous before a major exam, in the same way most people get slightly anxious meeting a new potential date or undertaking an unfamiliar activity. We second-guess whether we&#x2019;re ready for this leap, if we prepared adequately, or if we should postpone this potentially awkward situation. And in most situations, testing included, that reasonable level of nervous anticipation can be a good thing&#x2014;enhancing your focus and providing you with a bit of bravado to get you through a difficult time.</p>

Don&#x2019;t despair; you can still succeed if you suffer from test anxiety. The first step is to understand what it is and what it is not, and then to practice some simple strategies to cope with your anxious feelings relative to test taking. Whatever you do, don&#x2019;t use the label <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00021/index.cnxml:111:456">test anxiety</em> to keep you from your dreams of completing your education and pursuing whatever career you have your eyes on.

Our thinking is a key element of anxiety of any sort. On the other hand, test anxiety can manifest itself in other parts of our bodies as well. You may feel queasy or light-headed if you are experiencing test anxiety. Your palms may sweat, or you may become suddenly very hot or very cold for no apparent reason. At its worst, test anxiety can cause its sufferers to experience several unpleasant conditions including nausea, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. Some people may feel as though they may throw up, faint, or have a heart attack, none of which would make going into a testing situation a pleasant idea. You can learn more about symptoms of test anxiety from the Anxiety and Depression Association of America that conducts research on this topic.<a href="#auto_e8f40b3e-43f6-4f6f-a1b4-35d0bb4eac89_ch04rfin-10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">10</a></p>

We think constantly, and if we have important events coming up, such as exams, but other significant events as well, we tend to think about them seemingly all the time. Almost as if we have a movie reel looping in our heads, we can anticipate everything that may happen during these events&#x2014;both sensational results and catastrophic endings. What if you oversleep on the test day? What if you&#x2019;re hit by a bus on the way to campus? What if you get stung by a mysterious insect and have to save the world on the very day of your exam?</p>
            <p id="auto_e8f40b3e-43f6-4f6f-a1b4-35d0bb4eac89_para-00037" data-sm="./modules/m00021/index.cnxml:116:5">How about the other way? You win the lottery! Your screenplay is accepted by a major publisher! You get a multimillion-dollar record deal! It could happen. Typically, though, life falls somewhere in between those two extremes, unless you live in an action movie. Our minds, however, (perhaps influenced by some of those action movies or spy novels we&#x2019;ve seen and read) often gravitate to those black-and-white, all-or-nothing results. Hence, we can become very nervous when we think about taking an exam because if we do really poorly, we think, we may have to face consequences as dire as dropping out of school or never graduating. Usually, this isn&#x2019;t going to happen, but we can literally make ourselves sick with anxiety if we dwell on those slight possibilities. You actually may encounter a few tests in your academic careers that are so important that you have to alter your other life plans temporarily, but truly, this is the exception, not the rule. Don&#x2019;t let the most extreme and severe result take over your thoughts. Prepare well and do your best, see where you land, and then go from there.</p>

One of the best ways to control test anxiety is to be prepared for the exam. You can control that part. You can also learn effective relaxation techniques including controlled breathing, visualization, and meditation. Some of these practices work well even in the moment: at your test site, take a deep breath, close your eyes, and smile&#x2014;just bringing positive thoughts into your mind can help you meet the challenges of taking an exam without anxiety taking over.</p>
            <p id="auto_e8f40b3e-43f6-4f6f-a1b4-35d0bb4eac89_para-00039" data-sm="./modules/m00021/index.cnxml:121:5">The tests in the corporate world or in other career fields may not look exactly like the ones you encounter in college, but professionals of all sorts take tests routinely. Again, being prepared helps reduce or eliminate this anxiety in all these situations. Think of a presentation or an explanation you have provided well numerous times&#x2014;you likely are not going to feel anxious about this same presentation if asked to provide it again. That&#x2019;s because you are prepared and know what to expect. Try to replicate this feeling of preparation and confidence in your test-taking situations.</p>
            <p id="auto_e8f40b3e-43f6-4f6f-a1b4-35d0bb4eac89_para-00040" data-sm="./modules/m00021/index.cnxml:122:5">Many professions require participants to take frequent licensing exams to prove they are staying current in their rapidly changing work environments, including nursing, engineering, education, and architecture, as well as many other occupations. You have tools to take control of your thinking about tests. Better to face it head- on and let test anxiety know who&#x2019;s in charge!</p>

This fluency illusion occurred because he reread the material and that made him confident that he knew the content. However, Marcus had poor metacognition. Now that Marcus has more feedback from his test, he can use that information to help him determine why he failed to learn the content well enough for the test.</p>

While Michael was a good student&#x2013;As and Bs&#x2013;in high school, he was initially concerned that he was not ready for the academic expectations of college. This grade made this concern more real.</p>
          <p id="auto_01a2254f-88a5-4aca-80cf-d237110481dc_para-00012" data-sm="./modules/m00022/index.cnxml:49:7">When Michael was in high school, his parents expected that he would never fail any assignment or any course. On the few occasions that he brought home a C or D on an assignment, they would ground him until he raised his grades. He believed he would not be ready for college if he did less than quality work. One time, his parents had a meeting with his high school biology teacher about his progress. They have been involved and concerned about his grades because they wanted the best from and for him.</p>
          <p id="auto_01a2254f-88a5-4aca-80cf-d237110481dc_para-00013" data-sm="./modules/m00022/index.cnxml:50:7">Now that Michael is away from home and doesn&#x2019;t need to share his grades, he feels uncertain about how to deal with this experience. He knows that his parents cannot contact his professors about his grades, so he doesn&#x2019;t feel obligated to tell them everything just yet, especially because he has the opportunity to raise his grade in calculus. However, he wants to be honest about what has happened, especially if he cannot raise his grade before the end of the semester and needs to drop the course. He doesn&#x2019;t want to surprise them with the information.</p>

Learning how to do these well can only help you be more successful. Additionally, this chapter discusses the role that metacognition plays in helping you improve your learning processes. This chapter has provided a variety of tools, strategies, tips and information about how to develop skills that will be most effective for your experience. You can help yourself by taking these guidelines seriously and tracking your progress. If one strategy works better for you in some classes and another is more suited to a different course, keep that in mind when you begin to study. Use all the resources available to you, and you&#x2019;ll be well on your way to success in college.</p>

Even if you have solid skills your first year, you will need to continue to develop, hone, and add to them. To that end, consider what else about developing your memory, honing your study strategies, practicing good test-taking skills, or improving your metacognition you would like to learn or practice.

But, in reality, I did the opposite. I struggled through college, both in classes and in seeking experiences for my future. At first, I thought I was unique in not living up to expectations. But as I met more people from all different backgrounds, I realized my challenges were not unique.</p>
                  <p id="auto_339743e9-5169-4164-817f-eaefd23c1d02_para-00003b" data-sm="./modules/m00023/index.cnxml:45:7">I began capturing videos of students sharing their educational issues. Like me, many of my peers lack the study skills required to achieve our academic goals. The more I researched and developed videos documenting this lack of skill, the more I realized that student identities are often lost as they learn according to a traditional pedagogy. I began documenting students&#x2019; narratives and the specific strategies they used to overcome difficulty. Once we can celebrate a diverse student body and showcase their strengths and identities as well as the skills necessary to excel academically, my hope is that students of all backgrounds can begin to feel that they belong.&#x201D;</p>

Many students report within their first year that they have experienced loneliness or homesickness whether they live on campus or in another state or country or commute back and forth to college. The good news is that these states are temporary. With time, students who say they are lonely meet more people, get involved in study groups, and get to know their classmates and roommates better. The students who feel homesick or just miss their family, friends, and pets (yes, <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00023/index.cnxml:57:606">pets</em>) also report that once the term gets busier with events, meetings, class work, and studying, they find that the homesickness goes away.</p>

In fact, you will want to be mindful of what you can do to start relationships and improve them to create a more enjoyable college experience. This chapter offers specific suggestions that can help you get the most out of living and working with others.</p>

Think of a relationship where you have mutual respect and trust, supporting each other in tough times, celebrating the good times, and communicating with ease and honesty. This is a healthy relationship. Do you have someone in mind? On the other hand, if communication is often tense or strained, confidences are broken, or you don&#x2019;t feel listened to, appreciated, or valued, these are signs of an unhealthy relationship.<strong data-sm="./modules/m00024/index.cnxml:31:568"><!-- no-selfclose --></strong> Unhealthy relationships can have both immediate and longer-term health impacts. If you are<strong data-sm="./modules/m00024/index.cnxml:31:684"><!-- no-selfclose --></strong> unhappy in a relationship, try to improve the relationship, or end it. Do not stay in a relationship for the wrong reasons, such as fear of being alone or guilt.</p>

Even if you believe the person loves you, it does not make up for the harm they are doing to you. End the relationship.</p>
        <p id="auto_243bd007-b2d6-4872-a9b8-e3f3caad4da8_fs-idm350279760" data-sm="./modules/m00024/index.cnxml:33:7">Take a moment to assess the health of your relationships. Who are the people who make you smile, who boost your confidence, who truly listen when you need to talk, and who want only the best for you? Investing in these relationships is likely to make you happier and healthier. Relationships are two-way streets. How committed are you to your relationships? How much effort do you put into nurturing your relationships?</p>

Self-care involves any activity that nurtures and refuels you, such as taking a walk in the woods, going to a yoga class, attending a sporting event, reading a good book, or spending time with friends. When you are feeling calm and nourished, you are going to look forward to your day, and despite how busy it is, you will prioritize time with friends and family. If you don&#x2019;t take care of and learn to love yourself, you will never be able to bring your best self to any relationship.</p>

Self-esteem is about loving yourself and being happy for who you are. Building healthy self-esteem impacts how you see yourself, which can drastically improve your relationships. While low self-esteem won&#x2019;t keep us from romantic love, it can act as a barrier to a healthy relationship. If you do not believe you are good enough, how can you expect your partner to think so?</p>
          <p id="auto_243bd007-b2d6-4872-a9b8-e3f3caad4da8_fs-idm364760320" data-sm="./modules/m00024/index.cnxml:38:7">When you feel secure in yourself, this allows you and your partner to feel more secure about the relationship. If you have insecurities, it may show in your relationship as jealousy, defensiveness, or tension that leads to unnecessary arguments. Healthy self-esteem goes hand in hand with self-confidence, and feeling confident about yourself will translate into a stronger and more satisfying relationship. If you are experiencing low self-esteem, you may give your partner too much credit or stay in a relationship that is not healthy for you. If you find yourself changing your personality for someone else, that is never a sign of a healthy relationship.</p>

If you catch yourself thinking you are unlovable, unattractive, or not good enough, it&#x2019;s important to start talking to yourself in a positive way and to celebrate all that is uniquely you.</p>
          <p id="auto_243bd007-b2d6-4872-a9b8-e3f3caad4da8_fs-idm334043392" data-sm="./modules/m00024/index.cnxml:40:7">Self-care includes self-forgiveness. We all make mistakes. A misstep isn&#x2019;t the end of the world. Pick yourself up, put things in perspective, acknowledge any lessons to be learned, focus on all that makes you special, and move forward. Be kind to yourself.</p>

Costa Ricans in general report a high level of life satisfaction. Dan Buettner, author of the Blue Zones study of the longest living populations in the world, explains that Costa Rica &#x201C;is a place where religion, family, and social interaction are the main values, unlike trying to get ahead, or financial security, or status. Their cities are set up so they&#x2019;re bumping into each other all day long. They walk to the markets, where they have conversations with people.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_243bd007-b2d6-4872-a9b8-e3f3caad4da8_foot-00002" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">2</a></p>

Neighbors are like extended family, and people often stop in for a visit and go out of their way to help one another.</p>

When you start seeing the social circles you connect to as communities and prioritize your time to develop more closeness with those communities, you will experience many physical, mental, and emotional health benefits.</p>

Additionally, college students who are involved in extracurricular, volunteer, and part-time work experiences outside the classroom (less than 20 hours per week) earn higher grades than students who do not get involved in any out-of-class activities at all.</p>

In a meta-analysis of the research results from 148 studies of over 300,000 participants, researchers found that social relationships are important in improving our lifespan. Social support has been linked to lower blood pressure and better immune system functioning. The meta-analysis also showed that social support operates on a continuum: the greater the extent of the relationships, the lower the health risks.<a href="#auto_243bd007-b2d6-4872-a9b8-e3f3caad4da8_ch11rfin-27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">3</a></p>

He is, by self-admission, shy and has difficulty making friends. When he steps into his first class for the term, he meets Praya, a second-year student who says &#x201C;Hello&#x201D; when he sits down next to her. She seems outgoing and engaged as she greets others in the class as if she has known them for a long time. He feels out of place.</p>
          <p id="auto_243bd007-b2d6-4872-a9b8-e3f3caad4da8_para-00009" data-sm="./modules/m00024/index.cnxml:96:7">&#x201C;Hi, Haley. How was your internship over the summer?&#x201D; Praya asks one student. She asks another student, &#x201C;Breylin, how do we always have a class together?&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="auto_243bd007-b2d6-4872-a9b8-e3f3caad4da8_para-00010" data-sm="./modules/m00024/index.cnxml:97:7">John sinks down in his seat, afraid she is going to ask him questions as well. He pulls out his phone and looks through social media to keep her from bothering him. As other students enter the class, some quiet and others talkative, John wonders if he will have to interact with them. Even though he has not met many people yet&#x2013;and certainly has not had any deep conversations with anyone&#x2013;he feels anxious about having to get to know strangers and feels most comfortable keeping to himself at least for now.</p>
          <p id="auto_243bd007-b2d6-4872-a9b8-e3f3caad4da8_para-00011" data-sm="./modules/m00024/index.cnxml:98:7">John&#x2019;s story is not unusual. As you read in the previous section, many first-year college students have difficulty developing relationships in the first few weeks and months of college. The issue is often exacerbated by the constant notifications and vibrations that come from phones, which pull us out of conversations with others.</p>
          <p id="auto_243bd007-b2d6-4872-a9b8-e3f3caad4da8_para-00012" data-sm="./modules/m00024/index.cnxml:99:7">One way to improve your relationship-building skills is to learn the art of small talk, which is the first step in getting to know someone more deeply. Because we often turn to our phones or other distractions when faced with interacting with strangers &#x2013; or even people we know well &#x2013; it is no surprise that we haven&#x2019;t quite developed solid communication skills. If you want to get more involved in campus organizations, feel more comfortable in your classes, and eliminate general awkwardness in most social situations, then practice small talk skills.</p>

If you are not sure if you should ask the question or bring up the topic because you are concerned it may be controversial or not taken in the right way, then go with your instinct and choose something from the list above. Once you get to know people better, you can have deeper and more meaningful conversations.</p>

Look for times during the day to try them out such as before class starts, when you are waiting in line, or when you attend an event and don&#x2019;t know many people. With practice, it gets easier to talk to people you don&#x2019;t know well. And, who knows? You may find someone who can become a friend.</p>

If you are aged 18- or 19-years old (often referred to as traditional college student age), you may look forward to expanding your relationship types beyond family and friends and authority figures to classmates (those who are in your classes), peers (those who are in college or near your age and have similar goals and activities), mentors (those who can help you develop skills or goals), and authority figures (those who direct and evaluate your work). If you are older than the traditional college student, you may also find that your circle of friends and colleagues will expand in some areas&#x2013;and may even contract in others, at least while you are earning a degree.</p>
        <p id="auto_ae1664b0-d5ac-471c-85ea-1a08bbaa3bac_para-00003" data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:26:6">Some people, such as professors, may fill multiple roles at different times in your college career. For example, a professor of your first-year seminar may be seen as an authority figure who dictates the learning objectives, creates assignments, and evaluates you. That same professor may become a mentor when you take them again your junior year as you are working on your major or participating in undergraduate research with them. Finally, your professor can become a friend after you graduate, especially if you have developed a bond with them that transcends the work you did together.</p>

This may be a surprise if you think about your experiences with high school teachers where they have their own classroom and a set of responsibilities including leading their classes that they must do between set hours each day of the week. College professors, by contrast, have much more flexibility and autonomy in their schedules, their workload, and their responsibilities outside of class. Because of these differences, you will want to view them in light of their additional roles and activities. See the table for a breakdown of common responsibilities professors have.</p>

No one expects you to be best friends with them by the end of the semester, but you do want to view them differently than you may have viewed your high school teachers&#x2013;as experts in their fields, partners in your learning, and mentors as you move through your degree. Here are a few ways that you can initiate and develop a relationship with your professors:</p>
          <ul id="auto_ae1664b0-d5ac-471c-85ea-1a08bbaa3bac_list-00002" data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:79:6">
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:80:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:80:12">Get to know your professors.</strong> This means to learn their names and something about them. They may share a few personal stories or you may be able to view their resume (often called a CV or <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:80:234">curriculum vitae</em>), which will list their education and publications. It also means showing up early or staying after class to participate in small talk or stopping by their office hours to talk or schedule a time with them to connect virtually..</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:81:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:81:12">Demonstrate interest.</strong> You don&#x2019;t have to love the course, topic, or professor to demonstrate curiosity and focus in class. Nod when you agree or understand something or smile at your professor when they make a joke. You may find that pretending to be interested at first leads to genuine interest.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:82:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:82:12">Participate in class.</strong> One of the best ways to develop a positive relationship with your professor is to ask and answer questions in class. Engaging in a class discussion demonstrates interest in the topic and can go a long way in helping you stand out. If you don&#x2019;t feel comfortable speaking up in class, schedule a meeting outside of class to discuss key ideas.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:83:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:83:12">Ask about expectations and assignments.</strong> A great strategy that is underutilized is meeting with a professor <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:83:154">before</em> a test or assignment to ask about the expectations or to get clarification. In some cases, your professor may provide feedback on a draft or suggestions for studying.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:84:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:84:12">Speak up when you stumble or fail.</strong> Contrary to some college students&#x2019; beliefs, professors <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:84:137">want</em> to talk to you when you fail a test or get a low grade because you misunderstood or procrastinated. Speak up when this happens even if you know well what contributed to your setback. Professors like to see that students are invested in their learning and improving.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:85:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:85:12">Say &#x201C;thank you.&#x201D;</strong> If a professor gives you an extension on your paper or you just enjoyed the class, feel free to show some gratitude. Saying &#x201C;Thank you for helping me conquer my math anxiety&#x201D; or &#x201C;I learned so much this semester&#x201D; can go a long way toward building a relationship. And professors never get tired of students who are truly appreciative of their work.</li>

While you don&#x2019;t have to be on a first-name basis with all your professors by the time you graduate, you should consider identifying a few who have sparked your interest in their courses or research to get to know them better. It would be a shame to graduate and not be able to recall one professor you had!</p>

      Building a positive relationship with your professor is one of the most important parts of higher education, and a little bit goes a long way. Professors have many students at once and you likely won&#x2019;t have more than a handful, so do learn their names! When something comes up that affects your attendance or projects, contact them ASAP. Communication is key, and they will not take your academic shortcomings personally. Exceptions are made more often for students who show that they care about learning, and not just &#x201C;getting by&#x201D; with passing grades. Refer to your syllabus throughout semesters to keep from asking any questions they&#x2019;ve already answered, and don&#x2019;t be afraid to talk to them outside of class time. Utilize office hours if you have questions that would make a waste of class time, especially if what you need is unhelpful for classmates to hear; this time is made in their schedules with reason, and class time is slim and most valuable in the grand scheme of the course. College professors not only make great recommendation sources for things like transfer and even employment applications, but they also love having students in mind to whom they can offer new opportunities they come across with networks we could not possibly have yet. With some thought and effort for those who work so hard to make strong education possible for us, you can open new doors together. Professors recognize who makes the effort, and they remember! &#x2013;Parker Blue, first-year

While college is often portrayed as freedom, exploration, and fun, there may be a time (or multiple times) that is stressful or discouraging. These times can occur when you are not happy with an assignment, classmate, discussion topic, a response to something you did or did not do, feedback on your work, or a grade. Any time you find yourself worried, upset, or angry about an event or experience with a professor, take these steps so that you can resolve the issue quickly and positively.</p>
          <p id="auto_ae1664b0-d5ac-471c-85ea-1a08bbaa3bac_para-00009" data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:96:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:96:28">Step 1.</strong><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:96:71">Take a deep breath and write down what happened.</strong> Do this before you speak to your professor. Both activities, breathing and writing, will help you calm down and focus. It will also help you gather your thoughts.</p>
          <p id="auto_ae1664b0-d5ac-471c-85ea-1a08bbaa3bac_para-00010" data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:97:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:97:28">Step 2.</strong><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:97:71">Make an appointment with your professor.</strong> Don&#x2019;t try to resolve the issue before, during, or after class as those are not ideal times to talk about an important issue unless it is the only availability you and the professor have. Explain why you want to meet to help the professor prepare. This is especially helpful if you have received a low grade as your professor may want to review the assignment or test beforehand.</p>
          <p id="auto_ae1664b0-d5ac-471c-85ea-1a08bbaa3bac_para-00011" data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:98:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:98:28">Step 3.</strong><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:98:71">Explain the issue as clearly as possible.</strong> This is where the written account may help. Focus on what you experienced, heard, or read. Here is an example of a statement about a classmate&#x2019;s rude behavior that a professor would want to know: &#x201C;When I spoke up in class about the need for more resources for immigrants, my classmate said under his breath &#x2018;They should just go back to where they belong. I don&#x2019;t know why you care.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>

Share how you felt about the event.</strong> It is important to acknowledge your emotions, but you don&#x2019;t have to dwell on them. They will, however, provide some context as to why you feel the issue needs to be resolved. Here is an example: &#x201C;I was surprised when Jarod said that when I was speaking and it made me mad that he would interrupt me with such a statement.&#x201D;</p>

Provide a potential solution or ask for assistance resolving the issue.</strong> The phrases &#x201C;Can you help me understand&#x2026;?&#x201D; and &#x201C;Can you help me resolve this issue?&#x201D; are both good ways to frame this part of the process when speaking to your professor. Be prepared to listen, take notes, and make a list of steps you can take.</p>

Don&#x2019;t overlook the opportunity to create deep, meaningful relationships with others as they will be part of your network for support during college. Here are some categories of people you will want to create intentional relationships with and what they can do to help you succeed in college.</p>
          <ul id="auto_ae1664b0-d5ac-471c-85ea-1a08bbaa3bac_list-00005" data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:136:6">

Classmates can help you learn the material when they serve as tutors or study buddies, and they can be an emotional support when you suffer a setback in a course.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:138:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:138:12">Roommates.</strong> If you live on campus or away from home in off-campus housing, you may have a roommate. A roommate can also become a good friend who can make you feel more at home while you are away from your family.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:139:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:139:12">Peers.</strong> Your peers are people who are other students who populate the college campus. You will encounter them when you join organizations, attend events, or use certain services on campus such as tutoring. Many colleges employ fellow college students on campus to manage a residential hall, serve food in the cafeteria, and hand out sports equipment at the gym. Your peers also run organizations such as clubs, professional-interest meetings, and Greek fraternities and sororities. Developing relationships with your peers can help you expand your network and create connections with people who you may find helpful when you launch your career.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:140:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:140:12">Mentors.</strong> Many colleges provide opportunities for students to participate in mentorship programs. Your institution may have formal and informal programs that you can participate in to be mentored by a peer, a faculty or staff member, or even an alumnus in a career field that interests you. Mentors can provide you with advice and support as you work on your college and career goals.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:141:6"><strong data-sm="./modules/m00025/index.cnxml:141:12">Advisors.</strong> While there are many different roles on a college campus that could be included in this list, advisors deserve a special place because they are crucial to your success; they are also the first place to go when a student has an issue. Some advisors spend considerable time with students to help them choose a major and create a schedule each semester that will enable them to graduate. Others serve as a sounding board for students who are struggling in a class and deciding whether or not to drop. Developing a relationship with your advisor has obvious benefits: They get to know what your goals are and can help you refine them. They also are very knowledgeable about how to navigate the processes of completing a degree.</li>

For many students, the support they receive from family is key to their feelings of stability and support. However, there may be times that you experience tension or confusion with your family. Pressures arise from differences in experience or perspective, the financial aspects of college, and simply undergoing an evolution in your relationship. You may notice that your emotionally-supportive family is unable to help you navigate the college experience or give advice about what you should do. Other students may experience conflict when they choose a major or career pathway that goes against the wishes or expectations of family members. Finally, college students with children (or younger family members they care for) often feel overwhelmed when balancing their responsibilities; they may at the same time experience guilt or disappointment due to time spent away from the kids. Here are some times in which you may find that dealing with family can be difficult.</p>

Many of them have tales of group members who didn&#x2019;t contribute equally or who disappeared altogether. It is no wonder that a popular meme includes a photo of a casket being lowered into the ground with the words &#x201C;When I die, I want my group members to lower me into my grave so they can let me down one last time.&#x201D; We can laugh at this extreme reaction, but there is some truth in feeling apprehension about being disappointed by others. This section makes the case that if you know more about how group dynamics can and should work and how to communicate effectively during the process of completing a group project, you are more likely to have a positive &#x2013; or successful &#x2013; experience.</p>

Perhaps it is because group projects are probably the most &#x201C;real world&#x201D; experience you will do in college. Very rarely will you be asked to create a report, present to a client, develop a new product or treatment, or fix a problem without working with others and depending on them to do their parts in a timely and professional manner. The more practice you have developing your own skills as a group member and troubleshooting when things don&#x2019;t go smoothly, the more nimble you will be when you have to collaborate in your job.</p>

Bruce Tuckman<a href="#auto_21a72706-28db-4b21-8b8e-1b57e8df19b4_foot-00001" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">5</a> (1965) developed a model of group development. His initial four phases are forming, storming, norming and performing. In the <strong data-sm="./modules/m00026/index.cnxml:64:473">forming</strong> phase, group members learn more about the task they must complete as well as getting to know each other. For the most part, members act and think individually and may be polite or quiet when trying to make decisions about what needs to be done. Group conflict arises in the <strong data-sm="./modules/m00026/index.cnxml:64:790">storming</strong> phase when roles are assigned and a leader emerges. Some members may not voice their concerns and suffer from internal (and unexpressed) conflict while others may openly argue about what needs to be done. Groups may skip this phase altogether if communication is clear and roles are assigned to interest and strengths. The next phase is <strong data-sm="./modules/m00026/index.cnxml:64:1171">norming</strong>, or when group members work collectively to help each other achieve their goal. Members are aware of how their part fits into the whole and are mindful of supporting each other. The last phase is <strong data-sm="./modules/m00026/index.cnxml:64:1410">performing</strong> and is marked by members&#x2019; competence and confidence to complete goals.</p>

The goal of group work is not to have a conflict-free experience, but to learn how to negotiate challenges, concerns, and changes during the process. When group members set common goals, create clear expectations, and communicate regularly, they are less likely to experience insurmountable obstacles.</p>

First, review the assignment and ensure that everyone understands the scope of the work, especially the expectations of the final product. Take some time to discuss what the parts of the assignment are and what the expected outcome should be. Will you be writing a paper? Will you be presenting original research? Will you need special equipment, technology, or software to complete the project? Get clarity on the assignment before you get too far into the work.</p>

The leader should take action immediately when the issue arises by clearly naming the behavior, avoiding emotional language, asking the reasons behind the anger, and communicating a plan to move forward with the project. This may mean assigning the member to a specific and limited role, or, in extreme situations, removing (or asking to remove) the member from the group.</li>

The leader should go back to the group contract and reach out to the member, preferably in writing, and describe the missing communication, the tasks that have not been completed, and what the group will be doing to move forward without the group member. Even if the group member never reads or responds to the message, the group will have evidence that they attempted to reach out.</li>

Providing your group members with examples of how to deliver bad or difficult news (e.g., &#x201C;I am not able to meet my deadline&#x201D; or &#x201C;I think I need help with my tasks&#x201D;) can help your members feel more comfortable when it does occur. Be sure to treat others respectfully and with kindness even if you are justifiably frustrated by your group members&#x2019; actions or inactions.</p>

Ask your group members what they felt were the group&#x2019;s strengths and weaknesses. Use the debriefing to think about how to make changes to the process the next time you work in a group.

If the project was not worth a third of their overall grade, Michael would have given up weeks ago.

She wants them to resolve any issues that arise, and she does not want to be consulted on disputes that can be easily remedied by the group.

Without these relationships, your experience may be lackluster at best and lonely and difficult at worst. The first step to creating meaningful connections is to be healthy yourself and acknowledging the importance of community. There are also some ways you can jumpstart a relationship by improving your &#x201C;small talk&#x201D; skills. You will develop many relationships with different people while you are in college, but one of the most important is with your professors. Be sure to find ways to connect with them in and out of class. You will also want to be mindful of connecting with classmates, peers, mentors, and advisors as they will all be important to your network for success and support. Finally, there is no better way to really get to know others than when you work with them to complete a goal or a project. While group work strikes fear in some students, it doesn&#x2019;t have to be a conflict-ridden endeavor. Consider what you can do to anticipate challenges and make the process as smooth as possible.</p>

I had what some call &#x201C;social anxiety&#x201D; and even cried before getting out of the car on my first day. That year was a struggle for me, and I constantly had to fight with myself to step out of my comfort zone in order to succeed. I knew that if I made positive changes to my life then I would easily succeed in school. I joined a group of students who were a support system for me during my first year of college. Together we studied together and even worked out together. It helped me be more involved on my campus and less worried. Being connected with other students has taught me a lot of ways to cope with common problems many students face.</p>
                <p id="auto_e681a317-5324-45f5-95ad-5de673791509_fs-idm386781088" data-sm="./modules/m00027/index.cnxml:45:5">My first advice would be first and foremost, always make sure you are being kind to yourself. It&#x2019;s not advisable to work 40 hours a week and also try to be a full time student. You need to set up a realistic home and school life so that way you are balanced with your assignments and other responsibilities. You need to give your body and your brain time to rest so you can absorb as much as you want to without restrictions. I found it useful to start working out to make sure that I&#x2019;m dedicating the time I should be to myself and not working myself until exhaustion. Little things like exercise, yoga and meditation can do amazing things for your body as well as your mind. If you take care of your body, your body will take care of you.&#x201D;</p>

Some choices put you on a path to health, and other choices can lead you down a path toward illness. There is a strong connection between success in college and your ability to stay healthy.</p>
              <p id="auto_e681a317-5324-45f5-95ad-5de673791509_fs-idm399164432" data-sm="./modules/m00027/index.cnxml:61:5">Health is more than a strong body that doesn&#x2019;t get sick. Health also includes your overall sense of well-being (mental and emotional, for example) and healthy coping strategies to manage life stressors. Good health is about making positive choices in all of these areas and avoiding destructive choices. It&#x2019;s about learning to be smart, to set boundaries, to watch out for your safety, and to take care of the one body that will carry you through life. While health and wellness are often interchanged, it is important to differentiate the two concepts. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_e681a317-5324-45f5-95ad-5de673791509_term-00001" data-sm="./modules/m00027/index.cnxml:61:586" group-by="H">Health</span> is a state of physical, mental, and social well-being, while <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_e681a317-5324-45f5-95ad-5de673791509_term-00002" data-sm="./modules/m00027/index.cnxml:61:703" group-by="w">wellness</span> is a process through which people become aware of and make choices toward a healthy and fulfilling life.</p>

The first step is to focus on who you are and how you can create your best self. This includes how to promote self-efficacy (i.e., your belief in yourself) and create strategies that you can use to improve your resiliency (i.e., your ability to recover from challenges and adapt to change) during your transition into college. Next we will discuss the mind and body connection and how we need to consider managing both as a top priority every day.</p>
              <p id="auto_e681a317-5324-45f5-95ad-5de673791509_para-00002" data-sm="./modules/m00027/index.cnxml:63:5">We will address identifying your feelings and mood and build a vocabulary that helps you communicate with others. Then we will move into the topic of stress versus anxiety and how to manage both. At this point, prepared with identifying and managing your emotions with strategies you can use on your own, we will discuss when and how to seek help including the steps you must take to establish your own support system. Once you have a support system, we will then discuss the importance of managing your problems in a way that holds you accountable for your actions and behaviors yet provides a framework for others to help you effectively. We will then discuss the role of social media on your overall health and well-being and provide suggestions for creating boundaries with the use of social media. Lastly we will help you gain a better understanding of how to maintain physical health through good nutrition, maintaining physical activity, and sleep.</p>

But it is just as important to work on creating your best self in the process, as <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00028/index.cnxml:25:187">who</em> you are and <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00028/index.cnxml:25:241">what</em> you believe you can achieve are just as important as the piece of paper you will receive at graduation. The first step in this process is identifying your positive attributes, which will be the foundation of your self-confidence. The belief in your abilities is also known as your <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00028/index.cnxml:25:565">self-efficacy</em>. One way to increase your self-efficacy is to identify your strengths and values. Think of strengths as characteristics about ourselves that make us feel good about who we are, things we are good at, and parts of our personalities that make us good friends or good members of our community. Values are the things that matter to us the most. Typically we do the best we can to live by our values; however, sometimes we struggle. Identifying strengths and values is a great place to start when making big life transitions. Being clear on what you view as your strengths and the values that are important to you will help you with finding similar people to build your support network.</p>
        <p id="auto_a96a9f25-7e34-4136-9889-e38ee9b3fdaf_para-00003" data-sm="./modules/m00028/index.cnxml:26:5">Let&#x2019;s get started. First, consider your strengths. In <a href="#auto_a96a9f25-7e34-4136-9889-e38ee9b3fdaf_table-00002" data-sm="./modules/m00028/index.cnxml:26:81" class="autogenerated-content">Table 7.1</a>, we have listed several examples of strengths. What are your strengths? What would your family say if we asked them about your strengths? What about your friends or community, would they have other examples of your strengths? Answer these questions to make a list of your own.</p>
        <p id="auto_a96a9f25-7e34-4136-9889-e38ee9b3fdaf_para-00004" data-sm="./modules/m00028/index.cnxml:27:5">Next, let&#x2019;s consider your values. When finding your support network, friends, new clubs or organizations to join, one way to start is to understand your values and then look for others that have similar values. Your values have been shaped largely by your family, friends and the culture you grew up in.</p>

Understanding your current values and recognizing when they are being challenged may give you some insights into why you value what you do and what changes you may be open to. Consider the values in the table below and then list some of yours. Did you come to these through your family, your community?</p>

These situations may trigger strong emotions or lead you to react in a manner that you may later regret. During transition periods, such as the transition into college, you may be even more likely to have these experiences, particularly involving topics and people you do not know well. When these situations happen, it is best to consider your thoughts, consult available resources, and allow time to understand how to best navigate your emotions.</p>

Have you ever heard someone refer to &#x201C;seeing the glass half full&#x201D; or &#x201C;seeing the glass half empty?&#x201D; This is another way of saying that, given a situation that could be interpreted multiple ways, some see the positives (half full) while others see the negatives (half empty). It is natural to move in and out of these frames of mind depending on the situation, your confidence level, the amount of stress you have in your life at the time, and so on. Setbacks and mistakes will always occur, and it&#x2019;s okay and appropriate to feel negatively about them. With experience and practice, you will learn how to move on from these negative feelings and adapt your attitudes in order to promote success.</p>

            <li data-sm="./modules/m00029/index.cnxml:35:5">Now let&#x2019;s reframe to a more positive reaction: &#x201C;Yes, I will get a zero for that assignment. However, if I work hard on the final two assignments and get at least a B on my final exam, I could improve my final grade to at least a C+.&#x201D;</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_dc850187-e44f-439a-8895-af60ef8d579f_para-00006" data-sm="./modules/m00029/index.cnxml:37:5">How does this new thought feel in your body and mind? Is it different in a good way or not so good way? What emotions are you experiencing now? How has your mood changed?</p>
          <p id="auto_dc850187-e44f-439a-8895-af60ef8d579f_para-00007" data-sm="./modules/m00029/index.cnxml:38:5">Most likely you feel differently in your body and in your mind when you consider each of these responses. When the thinking is that the course is lost, you may feel disappointed, frustrated, and uncertain regarding the future. However, in the more positive reframing of the situation, the mood may shift to one of calmness and even purpose, because there is a way forward.</p>
          <p id="auto_dc850187-e44f-439a-8895-af60ef8d579f_para-00008" data-sm="./modules/m00029/index.cnxml:39:5">A key aspect of effective and positive attitudes is the awareness and ability to take responsibility for situations in which you contributed to the outcome. In the example above, the person did recognize that they were the ones who forgot to complete the assignment. Consider similar situations you&#x2019;ve been in. Do you tend to put the responsibility for a missed assignment or a bad grade on yourself or your instructor? Do you tend to blame technology, unclear instructions, or too much work? While unfair situations can certainly occur, it is very important to recognize the role we play in them, and take ownership of mistakes and any extra work we need to undertake.</p>

To do that effectively, you will also need to identify your feelings and emotions. Examining what you are feeling will help you to more easily navigate those emotions. By understanding your emotions and how to communicate with others about how you are feeling, you will decrease the chances of behaviors that may have negative consequences.</p>

Identifying your emotions will help you to find a solution or coping strategy more quickly. Using a tool such as this emotion wheel enables you to identify the emotion you may be experiencing. You may think that you are &#x201C;angry&#x201D;; however, after you look at the emotion wheel you may realize you are hurt or disappointed. Also, by identifying your emotions at a given time, you will be able to improve your mood and the relationship between your feelings and mood. Once you have a better understanding of the relationships between your feelings and mood, you&#x2019;ll be better equipped to overcome situations in which you have low moods versus when your moods are more positive.</p>

When experiencing these reactions it is best to take a step back and not allow your emotions to take over. This situation could have been avoided if Paige took a moment to pause and collect her thoughts. Reacting quickly often results in over-reacting; so, to prevent negative consequences, a better approach is to take a breath and walk away. The same idea applies when you are not in person: Taking substantial time before sending an email or text, reacting to a social media post, or responding to a comment in a discussion forum can make a difference between a careful, constructive outcome and one that leads to even deeper problems.</p>

This is your brain and body working together to let you know that they are stressed. The connection between our mind and body is powerful, and both feed off of each other to influence how we feel and function every day. The amount of sleep we get, the types of food we eat, what we do for exercise or what we don&#x2019;t do, all interrelate and lead to how we can manage our emotions or not.</p>
          <p id="auto_d60ee033-9356-4a04-b863-bf64b37f3956_para-00023" data-sm="./modules/m00030/index.cnxml:80:5">Developing coping skills will help you manage how you are feeling and calm your body and mind with the goal of decreasing your stress level. Taking a pause versus reacting immediately, such as going on a walk, connecting with a friend, or simply focusing on your breath during times of stress has the potential to slow down your heart rate and calm your mind.</p>
          <p id="auto_d60ee033-9356-4a04-b863-bf64b37f3956_para-00024" data-sm="./modules/m00030/index.cnxml:81:5">Although coping strategies help in these stressful situations, what you do every day to prepare your body to manage these times matters just as much. You need to focus on taking care of your body and mind daily. Again, the mind-body connection is so strong that what you eat, how much activity you do, and the amount of time you sleep directly influences your ability to manage your day to day stressors.</p>
          <p id="auto_d60ee033-9356-4a04-b863-bf64b37f3956_para-00025" data-sm="./modules/m00030/index.cnxml:82:5">Below are some simple suggestions to ensure you are making your mind and body your top priority. A more comprehensive understanding of each of these behaviors is discussed later in the chapter.</p>
          <ul id="auto_d60ee033-9356-4a04-b863-bf64b37f3956_list-00002" data-sm="./modules/m00030/index.cnxml:83:5">
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00030/index.cnxml:84:5">A healthy diet will help you to be your best self and keep your mind and body functioning properly. Balance is critical: Try to have a serving of a protein source, a carbohydrate source, and a serving of a fruit and vegetable at each meal. Typically you will find that your body and mind need fuel every 3-4 hours during the day. Knowing this, you can plan accordingly your meals and snacks. Lastly, don&#x2019;t forget to hydrate.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00030/index.cnxml:85:5">Being active for at least 60 minutes every day can be a goal for you if you find yourself spending most of your day sitting&#x2013;in class, while studying, or as you complete assignments. Being physically active will help your body feel awake and make you stronger to handle stressful situations. Even simple activities such as taking a walk, finding a yoga class or online video, or even a pick-up game of basketball can maintain good physical health.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00030/index.cnxml:86:5">As important as being active is, it is equally critical to spend time sleeping.

This dysfunction prevents you from taking care of yourself, interferes with your relationships, and may lead to you missing school or work. Depression does not have a single cause. It can follow a life crisis or physical illness, but it can also occur spontaneously. Several factors including trauma, a significant life change, brain injury, and drug and alcohol misuse may contribute to depression. Regardless of how or why it occurs, depression is a treatable medical condition, and the ability to identify what it is and how to treat it is important.</p>

If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, reach out to your doctor or call your local mental health resources on campus. During this situation, having a friend or family member to call and talk to is the fastest way to get the help you need. Building a network of support for yourself is critical.</p>

It is crucial for anyone with an eating disorder to stabilize their health, then continue medical care and counseling to reach full recovery. Eating disorders can be treated successfully with medical care, psychotherapy, counseling, or coaching. It is important to seek treatment if you suspect there is an issue. Treatment can address any underlying psychological issues. If you think you might have an eating disorder, visit a doctor or your campus health center.

We typically experience different types of stressors throughout the day. Although stress doesn&#x2019;t always feel good for us to experience and is often unpleasant when it is happening, it is typically for a short amount of time. Think about the last time you were stressed: taking an important final exam, having to present your work in front of classmates, introducing yourself to others at a new club you joined. These situations are typically very short and centered around a particular event. You may experience sweaty palms, a fast heartbeat, a headache or stomachache, but these feelings usually go away after the situation.

Anxiety will feel similar to a stressful situation, as described above, but the feeling doesn&#x2019;t go away. Using an example from above, you have to present your work in front of your classmates today and you feel very nauseous, your heart is pounding so hard in your chest you feel dizzy and have to sit down. You don&#x2019;t think you can walk the 10 minutes to class and decide to just skip class and stay home. This may be anxiety. Anxiety is different than stress as it sometimes prevents you from doing your daily activities. Anxiety may affect your ability to concentrate, increase your risk for heart disease, can weaken your immune system, disrupt your sleep, and can cause fatigue, and depression.<a href="#auto_bbdcc570-4a36-4d33-8f70-64036f99beda_ch06rfin-6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">6</a> The table above contrasts the differences between stress and anxiety so that you can better determine what you are experiencing over time.

      One thing I would say to encourage a student having issues managing mental health and school is you can do it. Take the time you need to seek help for yourself and the resources you need to achieve and be that version of you you want to be. Don't let your brain trick you into thinking that you can wait or you aren't able to do it. You can, it just takes you finding a system that helps you stay on top of your game. For me, being organized just by keeping my room clean led me to wanting to go to school and become a teacher in the near future. Discipline within myself was the hardest and still is but learning to work with yourself mentally will help you extremely in your academic career. &#x2013;Doria Mauro, first-year

It is part of the human experience, and despite how healthy and well-adjusted you are, stress is inevitable. What makes a difference is how you deal with it. One of the most important things you can do is to keep perspective on your stressors. When feeling stressed, ask yourself, on a scale of 1 to 100, how stressful a situation is this? Will I even remember this three years from now? When facing potential stressors, the way you interpret what you&#x2019;re experiencing can intensify your stress or minimize it.</p>

Following this challenging period in his life, he learned to meditate and found that it made him calmer and more resilient. He&#x2019;s now on a mission to make meditation approachable to everyone. Dan used to be a skeptic about meditation but now says that if he learned to meditate, anyone can learn to meditate! Dan reminds us that we are going to get lost, and our mind is going to stray, and that&#x2019;s okay. Simply notice when you&#x2019;re lost and start over. Every time your mind strays and you start over, it is like a bicep curl for your brain. Start with 3 minutes of meditation, and slowly work your way up to 15 or 20. <a href="https://openstax.org/l/danharris" data-sm="./modules/m00031/index.cnxml:183:732" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">To hear more about Dan&#x2019;s journey, watch this video</a>, and for a simple meditation to get started, you can try one of the videos on the <a href="https://openstax.org/l/meditation" data-sm="./modules/m00031/index.cnxml:183:917" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">meditation Youtube channel</a>.

According to UCLA&#x2019;s Mindfulness Awareness Research Center, &#x201C;Having an attitude of gratitude changes the molecular structure of the brain, and makes us healthier and happier. When you feel happiness, the central nervous system is affected. You are more peaceful, less reactive and less resistant.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_bbdcc570-4a36-4d33-8f70-64036f99beda_ch06rfin-9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">9</a></p>

In a UC Berkeley study, researchers recruited 300 people who were experiencing emotional or mental health challenges and randomly divided them into three groups. All three groups received counseling services. The first group also wrote a letter of gratitude every week for three weeks. The second group wrote about their thoughts and feelings with negative experiences. The third group received only counseling. The people in the group who wrote gratitude letters reported significantly better mental health for up to 12 weeks after the writing exercise ended.</p>

Think about why the experience feels so good. According to Rick Hanson, author of <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00031/index.cnxml:189:256">Resilient</em>, &#x201C;Each day is strewn with little jewels. The idea is to see them and pick them up. When you notice something positive, stay with the feeling for 30 seconds. Feel the emotions in your whole body. Maybe your heart feels lighter or you&#x2019;re smiling. The more you can deepen and lengthen positive experiences the longer those positivity neurons in your brain are firing&#x2014;and the longer they fire the stronger the underlying neural networks become. Repeat that process a half dozen times a day and you&#x2019;ll feel stronger, more stable and calmer within a few weeks.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_bbdcc570-4a36-4d33-8f70-64036f99beda_ch06rfin-10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">10</a></p>

As just discussed, there may be situations when you may want advice or support and need to reach out to others. Having your own support system is key. In this section you will build the foundation of your support system.</p>

Perhaps these individuals are still in your life but are harder to reach. This is your time to consider who you know now and then start the process of building a bigger system.</p>

This may be easier said than done; however, it is a great skill to develop while in college as you are around so many people. You will also share at least one or two values or strengths with these individuals at your school which is a great conversation starter. Other people that may be in your support system could be family members, professors or counselors at school, or even a sports coach or leader of a community group you participate in.</p>

You may have low motivation to complete assignments or attend class, be unable to concentrate during lectures, feel helpless with simple tasks, miss family or friends, or just feel unhappy with being in college. All of these situations could be related to a lack of sleep, poor eating habits, the negative effects of sustained stress, or symptoms of depression you may be experiencing. If you find that you are failing class or are in danger of being dropped because of attendance issues, or just can&#x2019;t seem to be motivated to leave your dorm room, use your support system. <a href="#auto_bbdcc570-4a36-4d33-8f70-64036f99beda_ch06fig04" data-sm="./modules/m00031/index.cnxml:234:675" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 7.4</a> provides a flowchart for dealing with common situations you may experience in college by providing prompts for determining when you can make changes on your own and when you may need to seek help.</p>

When you do reach out, consider how you feel, what your mood is like, if you have a handle on your emotions. You should be able to express yourself in the situation but have space to receive help. Remember it is best to go for a walk to cool off or take a few moments by pausing to gather your thoughts. This is a great time to pull in your support system to help you work through these feelings and emotions. With your support system you will be able to have a clearer picture of the problem and discover some steps to take to overcome the situation.</p>

Social media rewards a distracted, shorter attention span, which may reward giving our brain quick doses of dopamine. (Dopamine is a chemical in your brain related to feelings of pleasure or satisfaction.) Similarly, when your phone beeps, buzzes, or vibrates with new posts waiting for you, your brain receives a dose of dopamine.</p>

As you know, you can easily turn on/off your phone (watch, computer, etc.) notifications. Consider switching away from social media during your relaxing time and pick up a book or magazine, an old school puzzle, or journaling on paper. Another way to improve your concentration is to focus on one task at a time. Put away your phone for 30-90 minutes, jot down three tasks you need to complete, and check one off at a time. The more you use these strategies, the faster you will regain your focus and attention.</p>

To prevent social media from impacting your relationships, consider using social media more actively by reaching out to those in your network to plan in-person meet ups. Also, if you find yourself frequently comparing yourself to what you see on others&#x2019; social media, remember that people&#x2019;s digital life might not be reflective of reality. If you find such comparisons damaging your self-esteem and relationship with yourself, reach out to your support network and open the conversation.</p>

Let that sink in. Since we spend so much time on social media, dedicating such a massive portion of our lives to it, it&#x2019;s even more important we spend that time well. As stated above, there are definitely positives associated with engaging in social media, especially if you use it to learn more, broaden your social network, and enhance your life by letting it lead you to new offline experiences. However, there are times when social media use, or overuse, can be problematic and unhealthy.</p>

You may regularly become distracted while participating in activities that require your full attention, such as driving.<a href="#auto_72a21a4e-db85-498c-bcc5-313547aaa09d_ch06rfin-18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">18</a> Further, problematic social media use refers to using social media platforms for reasons that are illegal, unethical, or socially unacceptable behaviors such as stalking, bullying, or spreading misinformation.</p>

The relationship between mental health and bullying in the digital space, known as cyberbullying, is a newer problem and unfortunately provides a platform for bullies to say things behind the screen that most likely would never be said in person. Compared to traditional bullying, cyberbullying isn&#x2019;t easily reduced by supervision, has the potential for larger audiences, is often anonymous, and has fewer opportunities for someone to provide direct feedback in order to put a stop to the activity.<a href="#auto_72a21a4e-db85-498c-bcc5-313547aaa09d_ch06rfin-20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">20</a></p>

Cyberbullying has a larger audience due to how well connected social media is throughout the community, state, country, and world. Posts and conversations on social media have limitless reach which often puts the victim in a situation with very little control. Once information is in the virtual world, the text becomes very hard to remove and can &#x201C;go viral&#x201D; where it becomes so popular you can find it on any search platform.</p>
          <p id="auto_72a21a4e-db85-498c-bcc5-313547aaa09d_para-00022" data-sm="./modules/m00032/index.cnxml:116:5" class="has-noteref">Cyberbullying via social media can affect people of all ages, and it puts individuals in a difficult situation in which they cannot adequately defend themselves. The roles of each person involved in cyberbullying is consistently in a state of transition as people switch roles from being the victim, to the perpetrator, or the bystander as social media features (i.e., like, share) are utilized. In a recent study of US college students, 1 out of 2 students report being a victim of cyberbullying, while 1 out of 4 students report being a perpetrator at least one time per month.<a href="#auto_72a21a4e-db85-498c-bcc5-313547aaa09d_ch06rfin-21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">21</a></p>

Together you and a supportive person in your life can discuss the situation and make a plan to avoid further cyberbullying. Eliminating your social media platform where the attacks are occurring is not the only solution. Social media companies are aware that their users may experience these negative events and have put systems into place to report when users engage in such attacks. Theresa companies have also enabled features to block or modify account privacy to prevent situations in the future. The table below provides common examples of cyberbullying and their explanations.</p>

Even seemingly healthy foods like yogurt, granola, and other cereals are processed and should be checked for added sugar and other unhealthy ingredients. Review the label on these items and look for products that have less than 5 grams of fat and 10 grams of added sugars per serving. Also, review the dietary fiber and select products that have at least 3 grams per serving. Dietary fiber is a good thing; the higher the number the better.

This is so we, as consumers, know what we are putting into our bodies and can make good dietary choices. A quick review of the label will provide a lot of important information about what you are eating, yet most people don&#x2019;t take the time to read the label. This is a big mistake.</p>
            <p id="auto_76589156-056e-42db-a224-5cbf6b0b96ca_fs-idm349285744" data-sm="./modules/m00033/index.cnxml:53:5">Think of the front of the package as a marketing billboard. Don&#x2019;t be fooled by the marketing. Every day millions of dollars are spent to persuade us to eat foods that are not healthy for us. Through visuals and words (like natural, healthy, or gluten free), the food industry wants us to make assumptions about the nature of a food product without looking at the facts. For example, many people eat protein bars thinking they are a healthy choice, but protein bars can have up to 30 grams of sugar! Understanding the nutrition information and ingredients will help you make healthier choices. When you take the time to read the labeled ingredients, you are no longer being marketed to&#x2014;you are staring at the facts.</p>

How about water? Most of your blood and every cell in your body is composed of water. In fact, water makes up 60 to 80 percent of our entire body mass, so when we don&#x2019;t consume enough water, all kinds of complications can occur. To function properly, all the cells and organs in our body need water. Proper hydration is key to overall health and well-being. By the time you feel thirsty, you are already dehydrated. Dehydration is when your body does not have as much water and fluids as it needs.</p>

Headaches, migraines, and back pains are commonly caused by dehydration. Your body will also let you know it needs water by messaging through muscle cramps, achy joints, constipation, dry skin, and of course a dry mouth.</p>

If it is a dark shade of yellow, your urine is over-concentrated with waste. Water helps to flush out waste, so when you&#x2019;re hydrated there&#x2019;s a higher ratio of water to waste, turning your urine a lighter color.</p>

Your body becomes a little dehydrated as you sleep. Drinking water first thing in the morning allows your body to rehydrate, which helps with digestion and helps move the bowels for regularity in the morning. It also helps to eliminate the toxins your liver processed while you slept.</p>

Without adequate flexibility, daily activities can become difficult to do. Stretching increases your body&#x2019;s flexibility, improves circulation, and sends more blood to your muscles. Just a few minutes a day of deep stretching can have a powerfully positive impact on your health. Yoga and Tai Chi are other wonderful ways to improve your flexibility.</li>

Aim to exercise for 150 minutes a week. You don&#x2019;t have to be the king or queen of CrossFit; it&#x2019;s the daily movement that is most important. Research has found that three brisk walks for 10 minutes a day is a great start. While it is best to integrate all three types of exercise, the best exercise is the one you will actually do. Find and commit to a form of exercise you will enjoy.</p>

How often do you wake up still tired, with heavy eyes that just don&#x2019;t want to open?

The diminished energy that results from too little sleep often leads us to make poor decisions about most things, including food. Think about the last time you were really tired.

Studies have shown that people who sleep less are more likely to eat fewer vegetables and eat more fats and refined carbohydrates, like donuts.<a href="#auto_76589156-056e-42db-a224-5cbf6b0b96ca_ch06rfin-27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">27</a></p>

While we sleep we fix damaged tissue, toxins are processed and eliminated, hormones essential for growth and appetite control are released and restocked, and energy is restored.</p>
          <p id="auto_76589156-056e-42db-a224-5cbf6b0b96ca_para-00008" data-sm="./modules/m00033/index.cnxml:97:5">A review of hundreds of sleep studies concluded that most adults need around eight hours of sleep to maintain good health. Some people may be able to function quite well on seven and others may need closer to nine, but as a general rule, most people need a solid eight hours of sleep each night. And when it comes to sleep, both quantity and quality are important.</p>

The pineal gland secretes melatonin to calm the brain. The pineal gland responds to darkness. If you are watching TV until the minute you go to bed and then sleep with the artificial light from smartphones and other devices, your brain is tricked into thinking it is still daylight; this makes it difficult for the pineal gland to do its job. In addition, if the TV shows you watch before bed are violent or action-packed, your body will release cortisol (the stress hormone). Anything that creates stress close to bedtime will make it more difficult to fall asleep. A bedtime practice of quiet activities like reading, journaling, listening to music, or meditation will make it much easier to fall asleep.</p>

If you can control the temperature in your room, keep it cool in the evening. Scientists believe a cool bedroom (around 65 degrees) may be best for sleep, since it mimics our body's natural temperature drop. Exposure to bright light suppresses our body&#x2019;s ability to make melatonin, so keep the room as dark as possible. A 2010 study in <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00033/index.cnxml:128:442">The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism </em>found that individuals exposed to room light &#x201C;during the usual hours of sleep suppressed melatonin by greater than 50%.&#x201D;<a href="#auto_76589156-056e-42db-a224-5cbf6b0b96ca_ch06rfin-30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">30</a> Even the tiniest bit of light in the room (like from a clock radio LCD screen) can disrupt your internal clock and your production of melatonin, which will interfere with your sleep. A sleep mask may help eliminate light, and earplugs can help reduce noise.</p>

While not everyone is affected in the same way, caffeine hangs around a long time in most bodies. Although alcohol will make you drowsy, the effect is short-lived and you will often wake up several hours later, unable to fall back to sleep. Alcohol can also keep you from entering the deeper stages of sleep, where your body does most of the repair and healing. A 2013 <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00033/index.cnxml:130:490">Scientific Research </em>study concluded that &#x201C;energy drinks, other caffeinated beverages and alcoholic beverages are risk factors of poor sleep quality.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s important to finish eating hours before bedtime so your body is able to heal and detoxify and it is not spending the first few hours of sleep digesting a heavy meal.</p>

There are also great apps to help with relaxation, stress release, and falling asleep which include mediations, gratitude practice, and mindfulness.

A study from Stanford University found that 16 weeks in a moderate-intensity exercise program allowed people to fall asleep about 15 minutes faster and sleep about 45 minutes longer. Walking, yoga, swimming, strength training, jumping rope&#x2014;whatever it is, find an exercise you like and make sure to move your body every day.</p>

However, shortly after the end of the year, JT&#x2019;s family experienced the sudden death of his father. While he had had health issues, the family was not prepared for the loss, especially during a time that JT&#x2019;s grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins shared time with each other to celebrate the holidays. JT is very close to his family, and the thought of returning to his classes and continuing to work seemed too much to bear.</p>
          <p id="auto_76589156-056e-42db-a224-5cbf6b0b96ca_para-00033" data-sm="./modules/m00033/index.cnxml:152:7">Nonetheless, JT began the new semester, but soon found it difficult to get out of bed and go to class. Working was the only thing that he had motivation to do, perhaps because he needed to work to pay the bills. When JT has felt well enough to go to class, he comes in late, loses focus during class, and forgets to submit assignments.</p>
          <p id="auto_76589156-056e-42db-a224-5cbf6b0b96ca_para-00034" data-sm="./modules/m00033/index.cnxml:153:7">JT&#x2019;s boss has seen no difference in his work ethic or behavior, but JT&#x2019;s professors have noticed he is not performing well, and a few of them have reached out to find out what was going on. JT has ignored the professors&#x2019; emails and skipped appointments with his advisor to talk about his academic risk. Despite being encouraged to seek on-campus counseling, JT is convinced that he can get better on his own and doesn&#x2019;t have the motivation to talk to anyone other than his family members who understand best what he is going through.</p>

During these years, you will start the process of learning who you are and who you want to be. Your values will be questioned and your strengths will become more apparent not only to you but also to your support system. The goal of this chapter was to introduce you to the complex relationship between your mind and body; to help you identify the differences between feeling stressed versus being anxious; and to know when feeling sad may be symptoms of depression.</p>

With the hope you can continue to grow in this area and improve your health and well-being, consider one of the items below and commit to setting it as your new top priority:</p>

              <h3 data-type="title" data-sm="./modules/m00034/index.cnxml:60:5">What Would You Do?</h3>
              <p id="auto_b2a9a4f9-ec60-4536-880e-950f3d77aba1_para-00007" data-sm="./modules/m00034/index.cnxml:61:5">Think about this scenario: Everything was working out for Elan. They got into the college they wanted to, and some friends were planning to attend as well. They felt like an adult and were looking forward to new freedoms and opportunities. Elan&#x2019;s parents let them get a credit card after high school graduation. Elan shared an apartment with their friends just off campus, and was able to get where they needed to go because they had a car. Elan had also saved over $1,000 from gifts and a summer job. They needed a new laptop.</p>
              <p id="auto_b2a9a4f9-ec60-4536-880e-950f3d77aba1_para-00008" data-sm="./modules/m00034/index.cnxml:62:5">Elan planned to stay within set limits. They went to the store and found a very knowledgeable salesperson, Jermain, who said he knew exactly what Elan needed. Jermain pointed out that the laptop in Elan&#x2019;s budget would do schoolwork just fine, but it was not as powerful as the best unit with advanced gaming features. Plus, the better computer came with new headphones! Jermain suggested that Elan could later sell the computer to incoming students. (Most first-year students bought used computers if they did not have one when they came to school.) The high-powered computer was $2,000, though, and Elan didn&#x2019;t have that much money. Maybe they should use the credit card? Maybe their new part-time job would pay for it? But Jermain arranged for a small down payment and monthly payments of only $100. That did not seem too bad to Elan. The future looked bright.</p>
              <p id="auto_b2a9a4f9-ec60-4536-880e-950f3d77aba1_para-00009" data-sm="./modules/m00034/index.cnxml:63:5">At least, that&#x2019;s what Elan thought. They soon realized that working more hours meant fewer hours to study. Meanwhile, Elan&#x2019;s rent and gas usage went up, and, as a young car owner, their insurance was through the roof. Only three months into the first semester, Elan missed a payment on the laptop and accrued a late fee. They put the next laptop payment on the credit card. Soon, Elan was alternating payments between the credit card, laptop, and car, building up interest and late charges. Now Elan was having trouble paying their rent and started getting calls from creditors. Everything had seemed so promising. Elan didn&#x2019;t know where they had gone wrong.</p>
              <p id="auto_b2a9a4f9-ec60-4536-880e-950f3d77aba1_para-00010" data-sm="./modules/m00034/index.cnxml:64:5">Elan comes to you and shares the situation. They ask, &#x201C;What could I have done differently?&#x201D;</p>
              <p id="auto_b2a9a4f9-ec60-4536-880e-950f3d77aba1_para-00011" data-sm="./modules/m00034/index.cnxml:65:5">This chapter offers you insight into your finances so that you can make good decisions and avoid costly mistakes. We all face chances to spend money to try to get what we want. Many think only about now and not next month, next year, or ten years from now, but our behavior now has consequences later. Not everyone can own all the latest technology, drive their dream car, continually invest for their retirement, or live in the perfect home at this moment. But by understanding the different components of earning money, banking, credit, and budgeting, you can begin working toward your personal and financial goals. We&#x2019;ll also discuss a related topic, safeguarding your accounts and personal information, which is critical to protecting everything you&#x2019;ve worked for. By the end of this chapter, you will have good insights for Elan . . . and yourself!</p>

You can also use it to get a better deal when you buy a car or computer or rent an apartment. In fact, any time you are thinking about spending a lot of money, you can use the financial planning process to pay less and get more.</p>

If you&#x2019;re looking for a car, you probably need transportation. Before you decide to buy a car, consider alternatives to buying a car. Could you take a bus, walk, or bike instead? Often one goal can impact another goal. Cars are typically not good financial investments. We have cars for convenience and necessity, to earn an income and to enjoy life. Financially, they are an expense. They lose value, or depreciate, rather than increasing in value, like savings. So buying a car may slow your savings or retirement plan goals. Cars continually use up cash for gas, repairs, taxes, parking, and so on. Keep this in mind throughout the planning process.</p>

Do you need a new car? Will your current car last with some upkeep? Consider a used car over a new one. On average, a new car will lose one-fifth of its value during its first year.<a href="#auto_d58efb18-ec2f-4154-95ad-08d721516dcf_ch07rfin-5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">5</a> Buying a one-year-old car is like getting a practically new car for a 20 percent discount. So in many cases, the best deal may be to buy a five- or six-year-old car. Sites such as the Kelley Blue Book website (KBB.com) and Edmunds.com can show you depreciation tables for the cars you are considering. Perhaps someone in your family has a car they will sell you at a discount.</p>

It will help to check out the total cost of ownership tools (also on KBB.com and Edmunds.com) to estimate how much each car will cost you in maintenance, repairs, gas, and insurance. A cheap car that gets poor gas mileage and breaks down all the time will actually cost you more in the long run.</p>

You can also begin contacting dealerships and asking them if they have the car you are looking for with the features you want. Ask the dealerships with the car you want to give you their best offer, then compare their price to your researched price. You may have to spend more time looking at other dealerships to compare offers, but one goal of online research is to save time and avoid going from place to place if possible.</p>
            <p id="auto_d58efb18-ec2f-4154-95ad-08d721516dcf_para-00012" data-sm="./modules/m00035/index.cnxml:105:5">When you do go to buy the car, bring a copy of your written plan into the dealership and stick to it. If a dealership tries to switch you to a more expensive option, just say no, or you can leave to go to another dealership. Remember Elan in our opening scenario? They went shopping alone and caved to the pressure and persuasion of the salesperson. If you feel it is helpful, take a responsible friend or family member with you for support.</p>

Keep up the recommended maintenance on the car (or any other purchase). Keep saving money for your emergency fund, then for your next big purchase. The worst time to buy something is when you need to replace an important item that stops working or is damaged, because you are easier to take advantage of when you are desperate. You will be glad that you have an emergency fund.</p>
            <p id="auto_d58efb18-ec2f-4154-95ad-08d721516dcf_para-00014" data-sm="./modules/m00035/index.cnxml:110:5">A good practice is to keep making car payments once the car loan is paid off. If you are paying $300 per month for a car loan, when the loan is paid off, put $300 per month into a savings account for a new car instead. Do it long enough and you can buy your next car using your own money!</p>

When you rent an apartment, begin with the same assessment of your current financial situation, what you need in an apartment, and what goals it will impact or fulfill. Then look for an apartment using a written plan to avoid being sold on a more expensive place than you want.</p>

While saving a few bucks each week may seem like a small deal, you will gain practice using the financial planning process, so it will become automatic for when you make the big decisions in life. Stick to your plan.</p>

The quote at the start of this section was said by Warren Buffet who is one of the most successful investors of the 20th century, with a personal fortune of more than $60 billion. Setting aside a certain amount of money for savings and investments, before paying bills and making discretionary, or optional, purchases, will put you on a path to building your own reserve. Savings can be for an emergency fund or for short-term goals such as education, a wedding, travel, or a car. Investing, such as putting your money into stocks, bonds, or real estate, offers higher returns at a higher risk than money saved in a bank. Investments include retirement accounts that can be automatically funded with money deducted from your paycheck. Automatic payroll deductions are an effective way to save money before you can get your hands on it. Make saving money a priority to assure that you will work as hard to make the payment to yourself as you work to make your car or housing payment. The money you &#x201C;pay&#x201D; toward saving or investing will earn you back your money, plus some money earned on your money. Compare this to the cost of buying an item on credit and paying your money plus interest to a creditor. Paying yourself first is a habit that pays off!</p>

One method separates them into fixed expenses and variable expenses. Rent, insurance costs, and utilities (power, water) are fixed: they cost about the same every month and are predictable based on your arrangement with the provider. Variable expenses, on the other hand, change based on your priorities and available funds; they include groceries, restaurants, cell phone plans, gas, clothing, and so on. You have a good degree of control over your variable expenses. You can begin organizing your expenses by categorizing each one as either fixed or variable.</p>

Your needs come first: food, basic clothing, safe housing, medical care, and water. Your wants come afterward, if you can afford them while sticking to a savings plan. Wants may include meals at a restaurant, designer clothes, video games, other forms of entertainment, or a new car. After you identify an item as a need or want, you must exercise self- control to avoid caving to your desire for too many wants.</p>

Probably not. We want to hold on to every cent and decide where we want it to go. Our budget allows us to find a place for each dollar. We should not regularly have money left over. If we do, we should consider increasing our saving and investing. We also should not have a negative balance, meaning we don&#x2019;t have enough to pay our bills. If we are short of money, we can look at all three categories of our budget: income, savings, and expenses.</p>
          <p id="auto_acea1080-2946-4a4d-a80f-ca9874b37b70_para-00015" data-sm="./modules/m00036/index.cnxml:152:5">We could increase our income by taking a second job or working overtime, although this is rarely advisable alongside college coursework. The time commitment quickly becomes overwhelming. Another option is to cut savings, or there&#x2019;s always the possibility of reducing expenses. Any of these options in combination can work.</p>
          <p id="auto_acea1080-2946-4a4d-a80f-ca9874b37b70_para-00016" data-sm="./modules/m00036/index.cnxml:153:5">Another, even less desirable option is to take on debt to make up the shortfall. This is usually only a short-term solution that makes future months and cash shortages worse as we pay off the debt. When we budget for each successive month, we can look at what we actually spent the month before and make adjustments.</p>

Earnings, savings, and investments build up your assets&#x2014;that is, the valuable things you own. Borrowed money, or debt, increases your liabilities, or what you owe. If you subtract what you owe from what you own, the result is your net worth. Your goal is to own more than you owe.</p>

But over time and with good financial strategies, they can reverse that situation. You can track information about your assets, liabilities, and net worth on a balance sheet or part of a personal financial statement. This information will be required to get a home loan or other types of loans. For your net worth to grow in a positive direction, you must increase your assets and decrease your liabilities over time.</p>

To avoid compounding interest on loans, make sure your payments are at least enough to cover the interest charged each month. The good news is that the interest you are charged will be listed each month on the loan account statements you are sent by the bank or credit union, and fully amortized loans will always cover the interest costs plus enough principal to pay off what you owe by the end of the loan term.</p>
            <p id="auto_95a2be89-1401-4c43-a7d2-fe1a7c70e966_para-00005" data-sm="./modules/m00037/index.cnxml:33:5">The two most common loans on which people get stuck paying compounding interest are credit cards and student loans. Paying the minimum payment each month on a credit card will just barely cover the interest charged that month, while anything you buy with the credit card will begin to accrue interest on the day you make the purchase. Since credit cards charge interest daily, you&#x2019;ll begin paying interest on the interest immediately, starting the compound interest snowball working against you. When you get a credit card, always pay the credit card balance down to $0 each month to avoid the compound interest trap.</p>

            <p id="auto_95a2be89-1401-4c43-a7d2-fe1a7c70e966_para-00008" data-sm="./modules/m00037/index.cnxml:42:5">There are three main benefits of getting a credit card. The first is that credit cards offer a secure and convenient method of making purchases, similar to using a debit card. When you carry cash, you have the potential of having the money lost or stolen. A credit card or debit card, on the other hand, can be canceled and replaced at no cost to you.</p>
            <p id="auto_95a2be89-1401-4c43-a7d2-fe1a7c70e966_para-00009" data-sm="./modules/m00037/index.cnxml:43:5" class="has-noteref">Additionally, credit cards offer greater consumer protections than debit cards do when lost or stolen. These consumer protections are written into law, and with credit cards you have a maximum liability of $50. With a debit card, you are responsible for all charges made up until the point you report the card stolen. In order to have the same protections as with credit cards, you need to report the debit card lost or stolen within 48 hours. The longer you wait to report the loss of the card, or the longer it takes you to realize you lost your card, the more money in stolen charges you may be responsible for, up to an unlimited amount.<a href="#auto_95a2be89-1401-4c43-a7d2-fe1a7c70e966_ch07rfin-8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">8</a></p>

While most people associate a credit score with getting better rates on loans, credit scores are also important to getting a job, lowering car insurance rates, and finding an apartment.<a href="#auto_95a2be89-1401-4c43-a7d2-fe1a7c70e966_ch07rfin-9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">9</a></p>

          <p id="auto_95a2be89-1401-4c43-a7d2-fe1a7c70e966_para-00011" data-sm="./modules/m00037/index.cnxml:49:5">All the benefits of credit cards are destroyed if you carry credit card debt. Credit cards should be used as a method of paying for things you can afford, meaning you should only use a credit card if the money is already sitting in your bank account and is budgeted for the item you are buying. If you use credit cards as a loan, you are losing the game.</p>
          <p id="auto_95a2be89-1401-4c43-a7d2-fe1a7c70e966_para-00012" data-sm="./modules/m00037/index.cnxml:50:5">Every month, you should pay off your credit card in full, meaning you will bring the loan amount down to $0. If your statement says you charged $432.56 that month, make sure you can pay off all $432.56. If you do this, you won&#x2019;t pay any interest on the credit card.</p>
          <p id="auto_95a2be89-1401-4c43-a7d2-fe1a7c70e966_para-00013" data-sm="./modules/m00037/index.cnxml:51:5">But what happens if you don&#x2019;t pay it off in full? If you are even one cent short on the payment, meaning you pay $432.55 instead, you must pay daily interest on the entire amount from the date you made the purchases. Your credit card company, of course, will be perfectly happy for you to make smaller payments&#x2014;that&#x2019;s how they make money. It is not uncommon for people to pay twice as much as the amount purchased and take years to pay off a credit card when they only pay the minimum payment each month.</p>

Rewards systems with credit cards are designed by experts to get you to spend more money and pay more interest than you otherwise would. Until you build a strong habit of paying off your card in full each month, don&#x2019;t step into their trap.</p>

These components are credit payment history (35 percent), credit utilization (30 percent), length of credit history (15 percent), new credit (10 percent), and credit mix (10 percent). The main action you can take to improve your credit score is to stop charging and pay all bills on time. Even if you cannot pay the full amount of the credit card balance, which is the best practice, pay the minimum on time. Paying more is better for your debt load but does not improve your score. Carrying a balance on a credit card does not improve your score. Your score will go down if you pay bills late and owe more than 30 percent of your credit available. Your credit score is a reflection of your willingness and ability to do what you say you will do&#x2014;pay your debts on time.</p>

      College can be expensive and it is important to track your expenses and prioritize earnings to avoid unnecessary debt. I wish I would have taken more steps, for example, to eat at the college campus as much as possible my freshman year. I put the quality of food over the value of money. Throughout my college experience, I have learned the importance of being financially responsible and planning for the future. I have been saving as much as possible on a consistent basis. For example, putting earnings of 10-20% into savings each month, while my checking is for simple expenditures such as one or two nights out to eat a week with friends while I use my college meal plan for most food every day. If you are having difficulty understanding financial literacy, do not hesitate to seek out help from other friends, workshops offered by the college, or even professors. By taking a proactive approach to managing your finances, you can set yourself up for success and achieve your financial goals. I have learned the value of money, and understand how to allocate and use my resources to my advantage. With experiences and mistakes, comes a fixed mindset and change. Do not be afraid to take risks, but understand fully what you are giving up to get it. &#x2013;Ethan Marbaise, junior

We also generally pursue a secular or public education that often ends at high school graduation. After that, we have many choices, including getting a job and stopping our education, working at a trade or business started by our parents and bypassing additional schooling, earning a certificate from a community college or four-year college or university, earning a two-year or associate degree from one of the same schools, and completing a bachelor&#x2019;s or advanced degree at a college or university. We can choose to attend a public or private school. We can live at home or on a campus.</p>

The average income goes up with an increase in education, but that is not an absolute rule. The New York Federal Reserve Bank reported in 2017 that approximately 34 percent of college graduates worked in a job that did not require a college degree<a href="#auto_985f10db-f838-4147-bb42-09abeb863919_ch07rfin-10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">10</a>. Of course, many well-paying occupations do require a bachelor&#x2019;s or master&#x2019;s degree. You have started on a path that may be perfect for you, but you may also choose to make adjustments.</p>

Five of the programs tie loan payments to your income, which can make it easier to afford your student loans when you are just starting off in your career. The programs are described briefly below, but you should seek the help of a licensed fiduciary financial adviser familiar with student loans when making decisions related to student loan payment plans.</p>

You can also choose a graduated repayment plan, which will begin with lower payments and then increase the payment every two years. The graduated plan is also designed to pay off your student loans in 10 years (or up to 30 years for consolidated loans). A third option is the extended repayment plan, which provides a fixed or graduated payment for up to 25 years. However, none of these programs are ideal for individuals planning to seek loan forgiveness options, which are discussed below.</p>

If you make 100 percent of your payments on time and follow all of the other plan rules, any remaining loan balance at the end of the plan repayment term (typically 20 to 30 years) will be forgiven. This means you will not have to pay the remainder on your student loans.</p>
            <p id="auto_985f10db-f838-4147-bb42-09abeb863919_para-00046" data-sm="./modules/m00038/index.cnxml:196:5">This loan forgiveness, however, comes with a catch: taxes. Any forgiven balance will be counted and taxed as income during that year. So if you have a $100,000 loan forgiven, you could be looking at an additional $20,000 tax bill that year (assuming you were in the 20 percent marginal tax rate).</p>
            <p id="auto_985f10db-f838-4147-bb42-09abeb863919_para-00047" data-sm="./modules/m00038/index.cnxml:197:5">Another option is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program for students who go on to work for a nonprofit or government organization. If eligible, you can have your loans forgiven after working for 10 years in a qualifying public service job and making 120 on-time payments on your loans. A major advantage of PSLF is that the loan forgiveness may not be taxed as income in the year the loan is forgiven.</p>

Additionally, the strict rules and potential tax implications create a minefield of potential financial problems. In 2017, the first year graduates were eligible for the PSLF program, 99 percent of applicants were denied due to misunderstanding the programs or having broken one of the many requirements for eligibility.<a href="#auto_985f10db-f838-4147-bb42-09abeb863919_ch07rfin-15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">15</a></p>

This includes the right to know the terms and conditions for any loan before signing the paperwork. You also have the right to know information on your credit report and to dispute any loan or information on your credit file.</p>

Debt collectors can only call you between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. They also cannot harass you, threaten you, or call you at work once you&#x2019;ve told them to stop. The United States doesn&#x2019;t have debtors&#x2019; prisons, so anyone threatening you with arrest or jail time is automatically breaking the law.</p>

Deferment or forbearance can be granted if you lose your job, go back to school, or have an economic hardship. If you have a life event that makes it difficult to make your payments, immediately contact the student loan servicing company on your loan statements to see if you can pause your student loan payments.</p>

Fortunately, she has met with her financial aid advisor who has provided her with a few options that could help her cover her costs for the remainder of her time in college.</p>
          <p id="auto_985f10db-f838-4147-bb42-09abeb863919_para-00064" data-sm="./modules/m00038/index.cnxml:233:7">One of her options is to major in education and become a middle school science teacher. She likes this option because she loves science and working with young people. She finds out that her state has a student grant program for teachers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields who agree to teach for five years in a rural part of the state, a place that is several hours from Ana&#x2019;s hometown. The program provides grants to cover the remaining costs of a degree for the promise of the graduate&#x2019;s teaching in the designated district for the entire 5 years. However, the program requires that Ana commit to the major now, complete the degree, and sign on for at least 5 years of teaching service. If she breaks any part of the requirements, the grants will turn into loans that she will owe the state.</p>

Her family still relies on her and had planned for her to be close to them after graduation. While this is not the only option that Ana has for covering the costs of her education, it is the most promising one. The others are scholarships and internships that are highly competitive, and Ana is not confident that she has the grades or the experiences to compete with other more accomplished or needy students.</p>

Primarily, it generally allows you to do more of what you want with your life. When you have poor financial habits, too much of your money goes into other people&#x2019;s pockets. But when you have good financial management habits, you can afford to do more because you have worked hard, separated needs from wants, saved and invested, and avoided credit card and debt pitfalls.</p>

To make the most of what you have learned about financial literacy, specifically student debt and strategies for managing your finances in college, consider what else you would like to work on.

His parents express some concern that he may change his major&#x2013;and his career pathway&#x2013;to history or something else that would keep him from a solid, high-paying career in health care.</p>

He is also concerned about what he would do after graduation if he were to change his major so drastically. Would it be better to find another pathway within healthcare even if it is not physical therapy?</p>

I can now say with confidence that I have found the major for me! This was not an easy process though. It takes a lot of reflection to decide where you will focus your time and energy for your college career. The most important thing I had to consider was what major would provide me with learning outcomes that matter the most to me. I switched my major three or four times and each time I weighed the pros and cons of the major I was exiting and the one I was transitioning into. I decided to major in sociology and it has been the best decision of my academic career! I value social awareness and deep understandings of social phenomenon and sociology provided the course material necessary to place me on a path to begin learning about those topics. As a first-generation and low-income student, navigating college pathways can be difficult. That is why it is so important to be open to change and set on learning what you want, to learn how to get yourself to the next step!&#x201D;</p>

Though not every college freshman comes fresh from high school, those who do might be looking forward to the freedom of moving away from home onto a campus or into an apartment. Others might be excited about the potential to sleep in on a Monday morning and take their classes in the afternoon. For others, balancing a class schedule with an already-busy life filled with work and other responsibilities may make college seem less like freedom and more like obligation. In any case, and however they might imagine their next experience to be, students can anticipate increased freedom of choice in college and the ability to begin to piece together how their values, interests, and developing knowledge and skills will unfold into a career that meets their goals and dreams.</p>

That applies to school, to specific tasks, and to life in general. One of the most effective ways to keep motivated is to set goals.</p>
        <p id="auto_f0f17780-dd47-4a61-9ef2-98c84806a79b_para-00003" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:28:5">Goals can be big or small. A goal can range from <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:28:76">I am going to write one extra page tonight</em>, to <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:28:161">I am going to work to get an A in this course</em>, all the way to <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:28:261">I am going to graduate in the top of my class so I can start my career with a really good position</em>. The great thing about goals is that they can include and influence a number of other things that all work toward a much bigger picture. For example, if your goal is to get an A in a certain course, all the reading, studying, and every assignment you do for that course contributes to the larger goal. You have motivation to do each of those things and to do them well.</p>

Like time management, goal setting is best done with careful thought and planning. This next section will explain how you can apply tested techniques to goal setting and what the benefits of each can be.</p>

If the goal is not something you are really interested in, there is little motivational drive to achieve it. Think back to when you were much younger and some well-meaning adult set a goal for you&#x2014;something that didn&#x2019;t really appeal to you at all. How motivated were you to achieve the goal? More than likely, if you were successful at all in meeting the goal, it was because you were motivated by earning the approval of someone or receiving a possible reward, or you were concerned with avoiding something adverse that might happen if you did not do what you were told. From an honest perspective in that situation, your real goal was based on something else, not the meeting of the goal set for you. To get the most from the goals you set, make sure they are things that you are interested in achieving.</p>

In this case, the word <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:37:78">smart</em> is not only a clever description of the type of goal, but it is also an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. The reason these are all desirable traits for your goals is because they not only help you plan how to meet the goal, but they can also contribute to your decision-making processes during the planning stage.</p>

            <li data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:40:5">Specific&#x2014;For a goal to be specific, it must be defined enough to actually determine the goal. A goal of <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:40:115">get a good job when I graduate</em> is too general. It doesn&#x2019;t define what a good job is. In fact, it doesn&#x2019;t even necessarily include a job in your chosen profession. A more specific goal would be something like <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:40:361">be hired as a nurse in a place of employment where it is enjoyable to work and that has room for promotion.</em></li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:41:5">Measurable&#x2014;The concept of <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:41:37">measurable</em> is one that is often overlooked when setting goals. What this means is that the goal should have clearly defined outcomes that are detailed enough to measure and can be used for planning of how you will achieve the goal. For example, setting a goal of <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:41:338">doing well in school</em> is a bit undefined, but making a goal of <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:41:438">graduating with a GPA above 3.0</em> is measurable and something you can work with. If your goal is measurable, you can know ahead of time how many points you will have to earn on a specific assignment to stay in that range or how many points you will need to make up in the next assignment if you do not do as well as you planned.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:42:5">Attainable&#x2014;<em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:42:22">Attainable</em> or <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:42:74">achievable</em> goals means they are reasonable and within your ability to accomplish. While a goal of <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:42:210">make an extra one million dollars by the end of the week</em> is something that would be nice to achieve, the odds that you could make that happen in a single week are not very realistic.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:43:5">Relevant&#x2014;For goal setting, <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:43:38">relevant</em> means it applies to the situation. In relation to college, a goal of <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:43:154">getting a horse to ride</em> is not very relevant, but <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:43:242">getting dependable transportation</em> is something that would contribute to your success in school.</li>
            <li data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:44:5">Time-bound&#x2014;Time-bound means you set a specific time frame to achieve the goal. <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:44:90">I will get my paper written by Wednesday</em> is time-bound. You know when you have to meet the goal. <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00040/index.cnxml:44:225">I will get my paper written sometime soon</em> does not help you plan how and when you will accomplish the goal.</li>

Long-term goals are future goals that often take years to complete. An example of a long-term goal might be to complete a Bachelor of Arts degree within four years. Another example might be purchasing a home or running a marathon. While this chapter focuses on academic and career planning, long-term goals are not exclusive to these areas of your life. You might set long-term goals related to fitness, wellness, spirituality, and relationships, among many others. When you set a long-term goal in any aspect of your life, you are demonstrating a commitment to dedicate time and effort toward making progress in that area. Because of this commitment, it is important that your long-term goals are aligned with your values.</p>

Even when your long-term goals are SMART, it&#x2019;s easier to stay focused and you&#x2019;ll become less overwhelmed in the process of completing short-term goals.</p>

Given this assumption, you might give the example of a long-term goal of learning how to create an app and a short-term goal of remembering to pay your cell phone bill this weekend. These are valid goals, but they don&#x2019;t exactly demonstrate the intention of short- and long-term goals for the purposes of effective planning.</p>

To determine your best degree option, it might make sense to do some research to determine what kind of career you&#x2019;re most interested in pursuing. Or, if you recall that short-term goal of paying your cell phone bill this weekend, perhaps this short-term goal is related to a longer-term goal of learning how to better manage your budgeting and finances.</p>

He selected a degree plan in business administration, sharing with his advisor his intention to work in business and hopefully human relations in particular. His advisor discussed with him how he could set short-term goals that would help his progress on that plan. Sunil wondered if he should be as specific as setting short-term goals week by week or for the successful completion of every homework assignment or exam. His advisor shared that he could certainly break his goals down into that level of specificity if it helped him to stay focused, but recommended that he start by outlining how many credits or courses he would hope to complete. Sunil drafted his goals and planned to meet again with his advisor in another week to discuss.</p>

His advisor then recommended that Sunil add to his plan an additional note at the end of every other semester to &#x201C;check in&#x201D; with his advisor to make certain that he was on track.</p>

Credits relate to the calculated hours during a course that a student spends interacting with the instructor and/or the course material through class time, laboratory time, online discussions, homework, etc. Courses at all degree levels are typically assigned a value of one to six credits, although students often need to complete a developmental education course or two, often in English or math. These requirements, which cost as much as typical college courses but do not grant college credit, are meant to provide some basic information students may have missed in high school but that will be necessary to keep up in college-level coursework.</p>

These services are free to students while they are enrolled in school, but can be pricey if used outside a school setting, so take advantage. There are other tools online you can investigate.</p>

Though you may have a choice to select from a menu of options to meet general education and major requirements, electives are even less restricted. Some students may be able to take more electives than others due to their choice of major or if they are able to take courses that meet more than one requirement (for example, a sociology course may be both a major requirement and a general education social science course). Some colleges intentionally allow room for electives in a program to ensure that students, particularly those students who are undecided about their major, are able to explore different programs without exceeding the total number of credits required to graduate with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree. In other cases, students may have taken all of their major courses and fulfilled their general education requirements but still need additional credits to fulfill the minimum to graduate. The additional courses taken to meet the total credit requirement (if necessary) are considered electives.</p>

      One advice I would give would be to do your research on what you want to major in, don't do anything for the money because you have to think about whether you will be doing this career for a lifetime so choose wisely. To encourage a student I would say it's okay to get your feet wet when it comes to choosing what you want to do as far as your major. Sometimes it takes a couple of failed attempts in order to find the right path for you! Keep going and never give up! &#x2013;Ashanti Paden, first-year

Approximately 3.5% of the U.S. adult population has completed a doctorate or professional degree. Very few careers require this level of education for entry, so fewer individuals pursue these degrees. Doctorates are offered in many subjects and primarily prepare students to become researchers in their field of study. This in-depth level of education often requires an additional 90&#x2013;120 credits beyond the bachelor&#x2019;s degree, and may or may not require a master&#x2019;s degree prior to entry.

The most common professional degrees are Doctor of Medicine (MD) for aspiring medical doctors, Juris Doctor (JD) for aspiring lawyers, Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) for aspiring pharmacists, and Doctor of Education (EdD) for aspiring school and college or university administrators. If the career you are pursuing requires a graduate degree, you should keep this end goal in mind as you plan for the timeline and finances required to meet your goals. You may also want to inquire about special agreements that your college or university may have to expedite admission into or completion of graduate degrees.

At some point during your studies, you will be asked to decide on, or <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m00041/index.cnxml:190:390">declare</em>, a major.

Whereas a major comprises approximately 10&#x2013;12 courses of a bachelor&#x2019;s degree program and is required, a minor is usually 5&#x2013;8 courses, is often optional, and may count toward or contribute to exceeding the total number of credits required for graduation. Rather than take elective courses, some students will select courses that meet the requirements for a minor. When selecting a major and possibly a minor, you&#x2019;ll want to consider how the knowledge and skills you gain through those fields of study prepare you for a particular career. Majors and minors can be complementary. For example, a major in business might be well- matched with a minor in a foreign language, thus allowing the student to pursue a career in business with a company that hires bilingual employees. It is important to research careers of interest to you when selecting your major and/or minor to determine what will best help you to meet your goals.</p>

Loretta has decided that she would like to become a medical doctor. She has declared biology as her major and is taking the courses required to graduate with a bachelor of science degree in biology. Her university does not have a premed major, but it does have a premed track. She informs her academic advisor of her career goals, and her advisor provides her information about the premed track. The premed track includes a list of courses that students should take to prepare for the medical school entrance exams, called MCATs. Some of these courses are biology courses that overlap with Loretta&#x2019;s biology major, while others are higher-level chemistry courses that are not required for her major. She can take these chemistry courses, and any other premed-track courses, as her elective courses. The premed track at Loretta&#x2019;s university includes opportunities to attend MCAT study workshops and premed student club meetings. It also provides recommendations for summer volunteering and internships that will strengthen Loretta&#x2019;s resume and application to medical school following the completion of her bachelor&#x2019;s degree.</p>

Such requirements provide students practical experience or prerequisites for licensure necessary for a particular job. When requirements are major-specific, it is often because the requirement is state-mandated for that job. Majors that often include state-mandated special requirements are education, social work, and nursing. Some colleges and universities may require all students to participate in additional experiences beyond their regular coursework. You will want to ask your college about details specific to your major or institution. In this section we will generally discuss four such special requirements and experiences: fieldwork and internships, clinicals, student teaching, and service learning.</p>

Fieldwork and internships provide students with opportunities to practice the skills they&#x2019;ve learned in the classroom while also introducing them to the values and culture of the organizations and communities in which they hope to be employed. It is important to note that fieldwork and internship experiences are often available to students even if they are not required for their major. You may want to inquire with your academic advisors, faculty, or career services office to determine what opportunities might be available for you to gain this type of experience in your field of interest.</p>

Clinicals may take place in hospitals, nursing homes, or mental health facilities. They provide nursing students who are nearing the end of their degree programs with the opportunity to practice nursing skills that cannot be learned in a regular classroom. During clinicals, students will interact with real patients to conduct physical examinations, draw blood, administer medicine, and provide other care as necessary. Because of the risk to patients, students participating in clinicals are more closely supervised by experienced professionals than those in other types of fieldwork experiences. Thus, clinicals function very much like a real-world classroom and progress to more independent work through the semester. Before undertaking clinicals, nursing students will need to complete certain coursework and pass a physical examination and background check. Because clinicals are often much longer than a class meeting, students will need to work with staff from the program to plan their schedule. It may not be feasible to work at another job while completing clinicals, so if you must work while you&#x2019;re in college, it&#x2019;s important to discuss this with nursing staff or academic advisors and to plan ahead.</p>

Education students are often required to complete a student teaching experience in order to obtain a teaching license in their state. Students must often complete core education coursework prior to student teaching and must complete a background check prior to placement in a school setting. During their student teaching experience, students are usually paired one-on-one with an experienced teacher and have the opportunity to observe that teacher, get to know the students, understand the classroom culture, and participate in lessons as a teaching assistant as needed or appropriate. Much like nursing clinicals, this highly supervised fieldwork experience usually progresses to more independent work when the student teacher is asked to deliver and reflect on a lesson plan of their own design. Keep in mind as you plan for student teaching, that, unlike other fieldwork experiences, student teaching is limited to fall or spring semesters and cannot be completed in the summer because most schools are closed during the summer terms. Also, it may not be feasible to work at another job while completing your student teaching experience, so if you must work while you&#x2019;re in college, it&#x2019;s important to discuss this with your program staff or academic advisors and to plan ahead.</p>

            <p id="auto_ec663771-a3b1-410b-ab18-46c615df983f_para-00033" data-sm="./modules/m00041/index.cnxml:222:5">Service learning is very much like volunteering or community service. The purpose of service learning is to interact with and meet the needs of your local community. Service learning does differ from volunteering in that it is more structured to meet specific learning goals. For example, if you were engaging in service learning for an environmental science course, your activities would likely be focused on local environmental issues. Or, if you were engaging in service learning for a sociology course, you would likely be working with local community groups or organizations not only to assist these organizations, but also to observe how groups interact. Like fieldwork, service learning provides you an opportunity to observe and apply concepts learned in the classroom in a real-world setting. Students are often asked to reflect on their service learning activities in the context of what they&#x2019;ve been learning in class, so if you&#x2019;re engaged in service learning, be thinking about how the activities you do relate to what you&#x2019;ve learned and know.</p>

Some individuals refer to these degrees as &#x201C;two- year&#x201D; and &#x201C;four-year&#x201D; degrees, respectively. To complete a 60-credit associate degree in two years, you would need to take 15 credits (about five classes) in the fall and spring semesters during both years of your attendance. To complete a 120-credit bachelor&#x2019;s degree in four years, you would need to take 15 credits in the fall and spring semesters each of your four years. It is therefore entirely possible to complete these degrees in two and four years, particularly if you use the three primary resources that colleges provide to help you with your planning: curriculum maps, academic advisors, and interactive planning technology.</p>

It is also an advisor&#x2019;s responsibility to understand the details of your degree requirements. This person can teach you how to best utilize college resources to make decisions about your academic and career path. An advisor can help you connect with other college staff and faculty who might be integral to supporting your success. Together with your advisor, you can create a semester-by-semester plan for the courses you will take and the special requirements you will meet. Refer to the end of this section for a detailed planning template that you could use in this process. Even if your college does not require advising, it is wise to meet with your advisor every semester to both check your progress and learn about new opportunities that might lend you competitive advantage in entering your career.</p>

And the good news is that colleges and universities are set up nicely to help you utilize this process.</p>

While this is an important decision, even more important is to determine the type of knowledge you would like to have, understand what you value, and learn how you can apply this in the workplace after you graduate. For example, if you know you like to help people, this is a value. If you also know that you&#x2019;re interested in math and/or finances, you might study to be an accountant. To combine both of these, you would gain as much knowledge as you can about financial systems and personal financial habits so that you can provide greater support and better help to your clients.</p>

You&#x2019;ll likely learn about that in the course of your studies, but be sure to proactively inquire about these needs or seek examples. Early in your college career, you should be most focused on gathering components for your portfolio, not formalizing it for display or sharing.</p>

Your grades, interviews, test scores, and other performance data will tell them a lot. But sometimes they&#x2019;ll want to hear from others.</p>
            <p id="auto_37931cd9-a6e9-406d-8d84-b0e43e3b45f8_para-00033" data-sm="./modules/m00043/index.cnxml:204:5">Letters of recommendation are often a standard component of convincing people you&#x2019;re the right person to join their organization. Some positions or institutions require a certain quantity of letters and may have specific guidance on who should write them. Other companies will accept them as additional evidence that you&#x2019;re a great candidate. Either way, gathering such letters or having a few people whom you can ask for them will put you in a better position. Note that internships, especially competitive ones, may also require letters of recommendation.</p>

In fact, he earned Ds in Chemistry I and in Anatomy and Physiology. He will need to retake the courses and earn at least Cs in them to graduate with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in biology, but even more importantly, he will need to greatly improve his GPA if he wants to be able to get into a graduate program.</p>

He loves reading and discussing texts and analyzing their historical contexts. When he expressed this to his family, they encouraged him to &#x201C;get that out of his system&#x201D; and continue on his pathway to physical therapy. In fact, they often share with him news stories about salaries for people who graduate with liberal arts degrees versus science and mathematics degrees, and the data show that his physical therapy degree will be far more lucrative over his lifetime.</p>

Now he is unsure of how to bring this up to his family as they have made it clear what their expectations are. He doesn&#x2019;t want to disappoint them&#x2013;and perhaps they know better what he should do&#x2013;but he just can&#x2019;t find the motivation to retake the courses and work harder.</p>

After a discussion of the relationship between short- and long-term goals and the importance of tracking the progress of our goals, the chapter dove into the specifics of academic plans. Sections on degree types and the special considerations and requirements of certain programs should help you understand the type of opportunities that may be available to you and the types of questions you should research and ask. The section on planning your semesters provided you with the types of resources, people, and tools that you should look for when developing your academic plan. The final section shared some basic job-seeking advice and information that will allow you to begin the process of building the components needed to apply for positions during and after college.</p>
