Europeans believed they discovered an entirely new place when they encountered the diverse inhabitants of North and South America. Contact between the hemispheres began a long process of exchange in people, goods, customs, language, religion, and disease. Each group’s political, economic, and social structures felt the effects of this exchange, sometimes with devastating consequences. Through this inquiry, students will evaluate primary and secondary sources to assess how contact between Europeans and native peoples forever affected European and American civilizations.

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm400095536">During the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, Europeans explored the world’s oceans and distant coasts. Once a barrier to exploration, the Atlantic Ocean now became their route to other seas, faraway regions, and people unknown. In the “Age of European Exploration,” voyagers rounded southern Africa to cross the Indian Ocean, reaching India and the East Indies. Between 1519 and 1521, Portugal’s Ferdinand Magellan became the first person to circle the globe. In an unprecedented burst of new geographic knowledge, daring, and enterprise, explorers built outposts on newly discovered shores, creating the first global trade empires based on oceanic shipping (<a href="#auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_Figure_01_02_ShipRoute" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm399944112">The expansion was begun by Portugal, a kingdom on the <span data-type="term">Iberian</span> Peninsula of southwestern Europe. Sailing along the west coast of Africa, Portuguese mariners sought new sources of gold, ivory, pepper, and slaves. They slowly but steadily probed southward until 1498, when Vasco da Gama sailed around the continent’s southern tip and crossed the Indian Ocean to reach India.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm391517536">The riches of that new trade route fascinated Portugal’s Iberian neighbors, the Spanish. Seeking an alternate route to the trade riches of Asia, the Spanish rulers Ferdinand and Isabella enlisted the help of a mariner from Genoa (in what is now Italy) named Christopher Columbus. Like other educated Europeans, Columbus knew the world was round. Therefore, in theory, sailing due west would take his fleet to China or Japan, promising sources of silks and spices. He had no idea, however, of the exact circumference of the earth and greatly underestimated it. He also did not know that the Americas would block a direct voyage westward.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm382928672">In 1492, with three ships and ninety men, Columbus followed the trade winds southwest from Spain past the Canary Islands and out into the Atlantic. To his surprise, he reached then-unknown islands, the Bahamas and West Indies, located in the Caribbean Sea. Columbus stubbornly insisted that the islands were the East Indies near the mainland of Asia. Although the natives, the Taino, were unlike any people he had ever seen or read about, he called them “Indians,” a name for all the native populations that has stuck in the writings of Europeans and their descendants. (See the <a href="#page_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f" class="target-chapter">Native People</a> Narrative.)</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm401153952">Sailing home, Columbus reported to Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain in early 1493. They authorized an immediate and larger expedition of seventeen ships, twelve hundred men, and many livestock. This time the Spanish came to stay, to dominate the land and the natives, and to weave the new settlements into an empire to support a European power.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm391197920">Colonization proved tragic for the Taino. The Spanish viewed them as primitive savages fit for <span data-type="term">conquest</span> and slavery. They aimed to convert the natives to Christianity and introduce them to the civilization of Spain. Using the military advantages of horses, cannons, steel swords, pikes, and crossbows, the Spanish killed and captured thousands of Taino. Others they shipped to Spain for sale as slaves, but most had to work on plantations or in gold mines in the new Spanish colonies. The Taino population declined from 300,000 in 1492 to a mere five hundred by 1548. Most died as a result of diseases to which they lacked immunity and that unintentionally were brought across the Atlantic by the Spanish, though some died because of enslavement and outbreaks of violence. The Spanish had not intended to destroy the Indians, whom they preferred to exploit as workers and <span data-type="term">tributaries</span>—but exploitation sometimes led to violence.

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm384326928">To continue to work their mines, ranches, and plantations, the Spanish colonists sought new slaves by raiding the mainland of Central and South America. In Cuba, a brilliant but ruthless adventurer named Hernán Cortés became intrigued by reports of a wealthy empire in the highlands of central Mexico. There, by conquering their neighbors and exacting tribute, the Aztecs had grown rich and built a city called Tenochtitlan that was larger than any city in Spain. It featured lofty pyramids superintended by priests and ruled by an emperor named Montezuma. But in their rise to power, the Aztecs had also made enemies an invader could recruit.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm391421888">By alternating brutal force with shrewd <span data-type="term">diplomacy</span>, Cortés forged partnerships with Indians along his route into Mexico’s interior. Alarmed by the Spanish weapons and alliances, Montezuma tried to buy Cortés off with gifts. Instead, the invader seized the emperor. When the Aztecs fought back, the Spanish destroyed Tenochtitlan. Deploying thousands of new captives as slaves, the Spanish rebuilt the city as the capital of a new colony, which they called New Spain. By his death in 1547, Cortés had become the wealthiest man in the new Spanish empire. (See the <a href="#page_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd" class="target-chapter">Montezuma and Cortés</a> Decision Point and the <a href="#page_94c2ed58-86ee-44f2-9500-bca29a9c2c14" class="target-chapter">Cortés’s Account of Tenochtitlan, 1522</a> Primary Source.)</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm384240768">Cortés’s spectacular success inspired other Spanish <em data-effect="italics">conquistadores</em>—enterprising soldiers who sought wealth. The <em data-effect="italics">conquistadores</em> regarded plunder, slaves, and tribute as just rewards for men who forced pagans to accept Spanish rule and the Christian faith. Although many Indians embraced the Christianity promoted by Roman Catholic Spanish missionaries and its promise of eternal life in heaven, many others, noting that the Spanish appeared immune to disease, suspected the newcomers knew some powerful supernatural secret that spread death. In search of relief, some embraced the new religion because they saw it as a source of magical protection.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm412131216">Some missionaries spoke out against the heavy casualties and massive destruction wrought by the <em data-effect="italics">conquistadores</em>. These missionaries urged the Spanish crown to exercise greater control over the distant colonies, subordinating the private armies of soldiers. The most eloquent critic was Bartolomé de Las Casas, a former <em data-effect="italics">conquistador </em>who repented and became a priest. (See the <a href="#page_c0eba990-597b-455d-b7d8-36ee5dbd2af9" class="target-chapter">Las Casas on the Destruction of the Indies, 1522</a> Primary Source.) Las Casas argued for the humanity and natural rights of the natives. He asked: “Are these Indians not men? Do they not have rational souls? Are you not obliged to love them as you love yourselves?”</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm414297744">The Spanish crown did issue more rules governing the colonies, but the effort was hampered by continental wars and the Protestant Reformation in Europe, which diverted attention away from the colonies. The crown agreed that the <em data-effect="italics">conquistadores</em> killed too many Indians, who might otherwise have become Christian converts and taxpaying subjects. From about ten million in 1500, the Indian population of Mexico declined to one million by 1620. The decline came about primarily from epidemics of new diseases unwittingly introduced by the invaders, but also was the result of violence. (See the <a href="#page_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4" class="target-chapter">Columbian Exchange</a> Narrative and <a href="#page_ea9322da-3b23-4015-8914-a40affcae6d0" class="target-chapter"><em data-effect="italics">The Florentine Codex</em>, c. 1585</a> Primary Source.)</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm400105840">Missionary priests also criticized the legal authority granted to <em data-effect="italics">conquistadores</em> as exploitive and destructive to Indian communities. Successful <em data-effect="italics">conquistadores</em> obtained legal rights known as <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">encomienda</em></span> to govern and collect tribute from particular Indian villages (<a href="#auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_Figure_01_02_Encomienda" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). In return, the <em data-effect="italics">encomendero</em> was supposed to promote the conversion of Indians to Christianity by supporting a priest and building a church. Other Spaniards obtained private land grants, known as <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">hacienda</em></span>, which displaced Indian settlements and substituted ranches and mines. In 1573, the priests persuaded the crown to issue the Royal Orders for New Discoveries, which sought to reduce violence against Indians by increasing the power of priests over expeditions by <em data-effect="italics">conquistadores</em>.

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm391048032">The priests were not blameless. They demanded that Indians surrender their traditional beliefs and behaviors and adopt the ways of the Spanish. To that end, they oversaw the destruction of Indian temples, prohibited customary dances, and obliged Indians to practice the rituals of a new faith. The missionaries also ended the Aztec practice of human sacrifice to appease their sun god. Many Indians tried to adapt, but few, if any, could so quickly and completely change everything they believed. While publicly practicing Christianity, some still secretly venerated old idols and conducted traditional ceremonies. They assimilated the Christian faith into their traditional forms of worship.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm386767744">By 1540 in the Americas, the Spanish had developed the largest empire ever ruled by Europeans, larger even than the ancient domain of the Romans. At its core were the gold- and silver-rich colonies of Mexico and Peru, which eclipsed Spain’s initial settlements on the islands of the Caribbean. During the sixteenth century, the new colonies attracted 250,000 Spanish emigrants. Most of the emigrants were men; they married the widows and daughters of conquered Indians, with whom they produced mixed-race children known as <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">mestizos</em></span>, who became the majority population of New Spain by 1700. The core colonies developed hundreds of carefully planned towns with a grid of streets around a central plaza, which featured a municipal hall and a church. These towns were trading centers for a land of shrinking Indian villages and expanding Spanish farms and ranches.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm389497184">Ambitious <em data-effect="italics">conquistadores</em> probed northward, deep into the continental interior of what is now the United States, in search of riches held by other Indian empires. In 1539, Hernando de Soto led an expedition from Cuba that landed in what is now Florida and crossed the American southeast, reaching the Mississippi River (<a href="#auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_Figure_01_02_FloridaMap" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The Spanish discovered many large towns, vast fields of corn, and earthen pyramids topped by wooden temples, but almost no gold. In frustration , they slaughtered Indians who resisted them. In 1542, de Soto fell ill and died, and the remaining men built boats to sail down the Mississippi and return empty handed to Mexico. They left behind diseases that ravaged the region’s Indian nations, reducing the populations to a fraction of their size before contact with Europeans. The survivors of these epidemics abandoned the great riverside towns and pyramids, dispersing into the hilly <span data-type="term">hinterland</span>.

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm383086160">In 1540, Francisco Vasquez de Coronado led a similar expedition north, this time from Mexico into the American southwest, seeking the mythical Seven Cities of Cibola and their fabulous riches. Reaching modern New Mexico, he found substantial villages made of stone and adobe brick, which he called <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">pueblos</em></span>. He called all the inhabitants “the Pueblos,” although they actually belonged to several cultures with distinct languages. Failing to find gold or silver, Coronado and his <em data-effect="italics">conquistadores</em> provoked violence with the Pueblos after demanding supplies. The Spanish also attacked a dozen villages of the Tiwa Indians after again failing to acquire gold or supplies. Pressing northeastward, they crossed a vast grassy plain known now as the Great Plains. With little wealth to show for his venture, Coronado retreated to Mexico in 1542.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm393282096">The de Soto and Coronado expeditions were expensive failures and discouraged further efforts by <em data-effect="italics">conquistadores</em>. But missionaries wanted to return to the northern frontier of Spain’s new empire, to convert the Indians of Florida and New Mexico. They won support from Charles V, who, as the leader of the preeminent Catholic power in Europe, took the conversion of Indians and the expansion of the faith seriously. The king also saw a Spanish missionary presence as a buffer to keep rival European powers from developing colonies that might be used as a base from which to attack Spain’s valuable territory in Mexico.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm388316992">In 1564, in fact, a French expedition built a fort it called Fort Caroline on the Atlantic coast of Florida. In 1565, the Spanish sent Pedro Menéndez de Avilés with a small army to take the fort by surprise, slaughter the French <span data-type="term">garrison</span>, and build a Spanish town named San Agustin (now St. Augustine). The Spanish were unable to attract many colonists to Florida because of repeated Indian attacks and the vast distance from Mexico. However, they tried to convert Indians to Hispanic ways at missions that stretched across the region to the Gulf Coast. By 1675, forty priests were ministering to twenty thousand Indians at thirty-six missions in Florida.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm385881152">The Spanish also reoccupied the Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico, with a system of forts and missions centered around a capital they named Santa Fe (meaning “holy faith”). Too few colonists went to such a distant and isolated colony, so again the soldiers and priests had to rely on converting the Indians and taking tribute from them.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm386821072">By the end of the sixteenth century, King Philip II of Spain ruled not only the Iberian Peninsula (including Portugal) but also a massive empire in the New World, which stretched from modern Florida and New Mexico in North America to the lands of the conquered Inca empire in South America. The Spanish generated great wealth at their core bases in Mexico and Peru. Between 1500 and 1650, they shipped 181 tons of gold and sixteen-thousand tons of silver from the Americas to Europe. This <span data-type="term">bullion</span> enabled the Spanish to raise and pay for large armies in Europe. The armies dominated Italy and the Netherlands and threatened the rest of Europe.</p>

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm390862544">To even the military odds in Europe, the French, English, and Dutch wanted a share of the wealth being generated in the Americas. The quickest way to get it was to steal gold and silver from Spanish ships bound for Europe. Queen Elizabeth I of England (<a href="#auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_Figure_01_02_Elizabeth" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) even sanctioned <span data-type="term">privateers</span>, government-licensed pirates, to raid Spanish ships laden with New World treasure. During the 1580s and 1590s, Francis Drake, the most successful English pirate, sailed into the Pacific Ocean to capture Spanish ships along the Peruvian and Mexican coasts before heading west to complete his voyage around the globe. Lashing back, in 1588, Philip II sent an armada of warships to seize control of the English Channel and assist in an invasion of England. But the English navy and fierce storms combined to scatter and destroy most of the Spanish fleet. Thereafter, Spanish naval power declined while England and France expanded their commercial and colonial reach.</p>

To obtain steadier profits, the other European powers wanted their own American colonies. They wanted to exploit precious mines and develop plantations to raise tropical crops—sugar, cacao, and tobacco—that sold for high prices in Europe. Arguing for the benevolence of their own New World colonies, the French and English developed the “black legend” that the Spanish were uniquely cruel and destructive. Therefore, these critics argued, the Indians would welcome other Europeans as liberators.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm401288880">The French and the English had many violent encounters with American Indians in Canada and the eastern seaboard of North America. One English colonist wrote, “Our intrusion into their possession shall tend to their great good, and no way to their hurt, unlesse as unbridled beastes, they procure it to themselves.” For his part, the Powhatan leader Opechancanough asserted, “Before the end of two moons there should not be an Englishman in all their countries.” English settlers at Jamestown and Powhatan Indians attacked each other and sometimes engaged in wholesale massacres and retaliatory strikes. Although most encounters were based upon mutually beneficial trade, violence erupted often between Europeans and American Indians.</p>

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm387036960">As the French found out in Florida in 1565, it was dangerous to settle too close to the Spanish colonies. The French did better when they probed the northern waters and coasts of Canada—a land the Spanish had dismissed as too cold and barren—in the early seventeenth century. The French hoped to find either precious metals or the fabled Northwest Passage through, or around, the continent to reach the Pacific and the trade riches of Asia. Failing in both goals, they instead discovered coastal waters teeming with fish and sea mammals: seals and whales. During the warmer months, French fishermen began to visit the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Grand Banks near Newfoundland. In the fall, they sailed home with their catch, which they had dried in the sun and packed into barrels.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm408108304">Some fishermen began to trade with the Indians, who were skilled hunters living among many fur-bearing mammals, particularly beaver. Although the northern climate discouraged agriculture, it yielded especially thick and valuable furs, which fetched high prices back in Europe, where a craze for felt hats had developed. Indians eagerly traded the furs for European goods, including steel knives, hatchets, and arrowheads. (See the <a href="#page_a146631e-0a12-4f30-a3a6-2d5adaf19529" class="target-chapter">Henry Hudson and Exploration</a> Narrative.)</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm415774656">Indians grew dependent on these new goods, especially the steel weapons. Well-armed Indians nations could attack their neighbors, taking away valuable hunting grounds where they could kill more beavers to trade for more weapons. To avoid destruction, all had to find a European trade partner. But the Indians could also manipulate the French traders, who dared not alienate their suppliers of furs. Coming in small numbers as they did, the French could not afford to bully, dispossess, or enslave the Indians of Canada.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm383714848">In 1608, Samuel de Champlain founded a permanent French trading post at Quebec on the St. Lawrence River. His Indian allies and suppliers—the Montagnais and Algonquin—demanded that he help them against their enemies, the Iroquois, who lived to the south. In 1609, Champlain and nine French soldiers joined their Indian allies’ raiding party. Reaching the lake now named for Champlain, they attacked an Iroquois encampment there. Shocked by the French firearms, which killed three chiefs, the Iroquois broke and fled (<a href="#auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_Figure_01_02_Iroquois" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm412794880">The French advantage proved short-lived, for the Iroquois soon obtained their own guns from Dutch traders who settled along the Hudson River. With their new weapons, the Iroquois raided French settlements and the villages of their Indian allies. In pursuit of fur-trade profits, the French became entangled in complicated Indian alliances and enmities. At the same time, the fur trade escalated the warfare between Indian nations to unprecedented levels of bloodshed and destruction.

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm413825632">While the Spanish dominated the southern part of North America and the French focused their efforts on northern waters, the intervening Atlantic coast became, by default, the target of English colonizers. The English named the region “Virginia,” after Queen Elizabeth I, the “Virgin Queen” who never married. In 1587, English adventurers built their first American settlement on Roanoke, a sandy island within the Outer Banks of present-day North Carolina. Raising too few crops, they relied on taking food from the local Indians. Within a few years, the colony mysteriously disappeared, though historians are not sure whether by assimilation with the Croatan tribe or by a devastating attack. (See the <a href="#page_517190c2-a449-408d-9827-00240e970e34" class="target-chapter">Watercolors of Algonquian Peoples in North Carolina, 1585</a> Primary Source.)</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm401234912">In 1607, the English tried again, a bit farther north at the Chesapeake Bay, which offered better harbors, navigable rivers, and fertile land. The Virginia Company, an entrepreneurial joint-stock company, erected a settlement at Jamestown beside the James River, both places named for the new king of England, James I. One of its leaders was John Smith, bold and dashing despite his humble origins in England, who claimed the Indian Pocahontas had saved him from execution by her father, a powerful chief named Powhatan (<a href="#auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_Figure_01_02_Powhatan" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm395870368">Repeating the mistake of Roanoke, however, the Jamestown colonists worked too little at raising crops, perhaps because Smith and the other leaders required them to tend communal fields where shirking was widespread. The colony’s ever-changing succession of leaders also ordered them to hunt for gold and seize food from the Indians. As a result, the newcomers suffered from hunger, disease, and violence wrought by Indians led by Powhatan. When a new governor, Thomas Dale, arrived in 1611, he observed untended communal fields, only “some few seeds put into a private garden or two,” and the inhabitants engaged in “their daily and usuall workes, bowling in the streets.” He introduced martial law, which further impinged upon the liberties of the colonists. The subsequent introduction of private property on which they would grow their own food met with considerable success, however. As settler Ralph Hamor observed in 1615, “When our people were fedde out of the common store and laboured jointly in the manuring of the ground, and planting corne, glad was that man that could slippe from his labour, nay the most honest of them in a generall businese, would take so much faithfull and true paines, in a weeke, as now he will doe in a day.”</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm409932880">Conditions slowly improved during the 1610s, thanks in part to the efforts of an especially enterprising colonist named John Rolfe. In 1614, Rolfe married Pocahontas (<a href="#auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_Figure_01_02_Pocahontas" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), a union that diminished hostilities between her people and the English, just as marriages among European royalty cemented diplomatic relations between  families and nations. Taking the name “Rebecca” and embracing Christianity, Pocahontas went to England with Rolfe on a promotional tour to raise money for the colony. Her presence, in fine European clothing, suggested the English would succeed in converting the natives. Her capture and conversion also persuaded her elderly and weary father to suspend his war against the Virginia colony. But in 1617, at the age of just 21 years, Pocahontas died of disease in England.</p>

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm391375344">Rolfe also promoted the cultivation of a promising new crop: tobacco. Although worthless as food, the plant was mildly intoxicating and highly addictive after being dried and cured so it could be smoked. After Rolfe developed milder strains of the plant, the English began to crave tobacco, which grew better in the Virginia heat than in the cool climate of Britain. By 1624, Virginia had produced 200,000 pounds of tobacco. Fourteen years later, that production had soared to three million pounds.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm388470768">Profits from tobacco and greater opportunity attracted more immigrants to the Virginia colony. From only 350 people in 1616, its numbers had swelled to thirteen thousand by 1650. Most arrived as poor young men who signed an indenture or labor contract to work for wealthy landowners for a set period in return for their passage, food, clothing, and lodging. Settlers also often earned land, transferred to them from planters who received it through the “headright system,” which rewarded those who brought Englishmen to Virginia and thereby saved the Virginia Company, and later the Crown, the expense of populating the colony. The terms of the settlers’ “<span data-type="term">indentured servitude</span>” typically lasted at least four years. Indentured servants gambled their lives on an unhealthy climate. If they survived their terms, they would obtain land and buy their own servants.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm384129744">Starting in 1619, an occasional shipment of enslaved Africans arrived to provide another source of labor for those who could afford to buy them. Initially, the colonists treated some of the Africans as indentured servants, who also became free at the end of their terms. Free black people were not an uncommon sight in the first few decades of settlement; some African-born Virginians owned their own land and the labor of English indentured servants and African slaves. In the aftermath of Bacon’s Rebellion (1676), Virginia increasingly switched its labor force from indentured servants to African slaves, as greater opportunity in England reduced the supply of indentures and the growing Atlantic slave trade expanded the supply of Africans. Over the course of the century, however, the colonists increasingly treated the Africans as lifelong slaves who were forced to pass that status on to their children (<a href="#auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_Figure_01_02_Tobacco" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm383999936">The colony’s early years took a grisly toll. Between 1607 and 1622, about ten thousand colonists settled in Virginia, but only a fifth were still alive in 1622 when their Indian neighbors launched a massacre that had left 347 Englishmen dead by day’s end. A critic declared that the colony had become “a slaughterhouse.” The death rate exceeded the birth rate in Virginia throughout the seventeenth century because of the unhealthy Tidewater climate and prevalence of disease. (See <a href="#page_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab" class="target-chapter">The Anglo-Powhatan War of 1622</a> Narrative.)</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm396908160">Yet the English had come to Virginia to stay, to the dismay of the Indians, whose numbers also decreased as a result of war and disease. However, the king took control of the colony because the Virginia Company could not handle the problems with the Indian population or the discontent of the settlers. Moreover, an investigation revealed the shocking mortality rates. Thereafter, the crown appointed a governor who had to cooperate with the New World’s earliest elected legislature, known as the House of Burgesses. This body first convened in Jamestown in the summer of 1619, only a few days before the first ship carrying enslaved Africans arrived at a dock a few hundred feet away. These conflicting visions of democracy and slavery continued to shape America. (See the <a href="#page_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c" class="target-chapter">Origins of the Slave Trade</a> Narrative.)</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm383845360">In the 1620s, the English developed another set of colonies, known as “New England,” farther north along the coast (and beyond the small Dutch colony of New Netherland on the Hudson River). A colder, rockier land, New England was less promising for cultivating crops for export to England. A group called the Pilgrims was the first to arrive there in 1620. The Pilgrims were separatists who believed the Church of England was irredeemable and saw no other solution but to leave the Church and the country. After a brief stay in Holland, the Pilgrims eventually set sail for the New World and settled just north of Cape Cod in the town of Plymouth. (See the <a href="#page_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07" class="target-chapter">Reasons for the Pilgrims’ Emigration</a> Decision Point.) According to their governor, William Bradford, they “fell upon their knees and blessed the God of Heaven, who had brought them over the vast and furious ocean, and delivered them from all the perils and miseries thereof, again to set their feet on the firm and stable earth.” In signing the Mayflower Compact, they agreed to cooperate and write just laws.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm395716256">The region also attracted colonists who adhered to a purist form of Protestant Christianity, which had led their critics at home in England to call them “Puritans.” The Puritans felt persecuted by the English government and troubled by the immoralities they detected in England. They were a hard-working as well as a moralistic people. One Puritan preached, “God sent you unto this world as unto a Workhouse, not a Playhouse.” While most Puritans stayed behind in England, thousands went to New England during the 1630s to establish a model society governed by their understanding of the Bible. They expected that such a “Bible <span data-type="term">Commonwealth</span>” would prosper and inspire the people back in England to copy their example—as Governor John Winthrop put it, to be “a city upon a hill,” a phrase he borrowed from the Book of Matthew (<a href="#auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_Figure_01_02_SealWinth" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm388436096">Unable to agree among themselves on the matters of religion, <span data-type="term">dissident</span>s left Massachusetts and Plymouth to found other colonies in nearby Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire. Rhode Island tended to attract radicals who broke with New England orthodoxy, including Roger Williams, who favored a stricter separation of church and state, and Anne Hutchinson, who was banished because she refused to back down from her claim to women’s right to convene meetings to discuss religious beliefs. (See the <a href="#page_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288" class="target-chapter">Anne Hutchinson and Religious Dissent</a> Narrative.) Although they bickered with one another, the New England colonists united to fight the Indians who resisted their expansion. For example, in 1637, they destroyed the Pequot Indians of eastern Connecticut. (See <a href="#page_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4" class="target-chapter">The Salem Witch Trials</a> Narrative.)</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm403189872">Unlike the Virginians, most of the New Englanders came from the middle class and <span data-type="term">emigrated</span> as free families; they were often married couples with young children. Although twice as many English had migrated to Virginia, New England had the larger population of colonists by 1660, thanks to a more equal balance of the sexes, a healthier climate, better living conditions, and a higher birth rate.</p>
<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm400215024">New Englanders diversified their economy and did not focus on tobacco and other cash crops, as southerners did. They developed smaller farms and raised a little of everything: wheat, rye, barley, corn, potatoes, vegetables, chickens, hogs, horses, and cattle. Because the crops were not labor intensive, labor was supplied by the settlers’ many children rather than by slaves or indentured servants. For export, the region also developed fisheries and shipbuilding. In contrast to the extremes of wealth and poverty found in England and the Chesapeake Bay area, a broad middle class of yeoman farmers populated New England. These farmers were literate in a society that valued education and scripture reading. In Massachusetts Bay, freemen who were older than 21 years and church members could vote. Although their farms produced less wealth than did the plantations of the Chesapeake area, a broad equality characterized the farmers and tradesmen of New England. The wealthiest were a few merchants in the seaports, who managed the export of fish and ships, and the import of manufactured goods from England and enslaved Africans in the Atlantic slave trade.</p>

<p id="auto_22e8aac4-82ad-474f-867d-3059dfde7829_fs-idm404987312">By the early seventeenth century, Europeans had come by the thousands to dominate the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America. They built rival empires covering much of the Americas and competed to control the resources and Indians. Arriving first, the Spanish claimed the densest areas of Indian civilization in Mesoamerica. They also sustained weaker colonies along a broad northern frontier stretching from New Mexico to Florida. Arriving in smaller numbers, the French developed a far northern colony and relied on fishing and on trading furs with Indians living near their sparse settlements in the St. Lawrence Valley. They also formed military alliances with the Indians. The English came relatively late and claimed the temperate region best suited for family farms and tobacco plantations. Agriculture attracted and sustained many more immigrants in Virginia and New England than the French could muster for Canada or the Spanish could attract to Florida and New Mexico. In the contest to colonize North America, the English had the advantage of growing numbers but the disadvantage of fiercer Indian resistance. Despite initial military advantages, Europeans did not drive the Indians from the interior for another two centuries.</p>

So that we shall see much more of his wisdom, power, goodness and truth, than formerly we have been acquainted with. We shall find that the God of Israel is among us, when ten of us shall be able to resist a thousand of our enemies; when he shall make us a praise and glory that men shall say of succeeding plantations, ‘the Lord make it likely that of <i>New England</i>.’ For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world. We shall open the mouths of enemies to speak evil of the ways of God, and all professors for God’s sake. We shall shame the faces of many of God’s worthy servants, and cause their prayers to be turned into curses upon us till wee be consumed out of the good land whither we are a going.”</p>

<p id="auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_fs-idm242671952">United States history did not start with Columbus sailing west, John Smith meeting Pocahontas, or Pilgrims celebrating the first Thanksgiving. For at least twelve thousand years before those events took place, North America was home to a diversity of human communities whose living descendants are now called Native Americans or American Indians (<a href="#auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_Figure_01_03_NACulture" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Contrary to a persistent but outdated view of history, says historian Colin Calloway, “What Columbus ’discovered’ was not a ’new world,’ but another old world, rich in diverse peoples, histories, and cultures.”</p>

<p id="auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_fs-idm236320864">By 1492, the area north of Mexico contained between seven million and eighteen million people, divided into hundreds of distinct cultures that had evolved and adapted to the varied environments of North America. Along the Northwest Coast, for example, rich ocean resources and abundant salmon runs enabled Native Americans to develop societies of unique complexity. Without agriculture or domesticated animals, they sustained large, mostly sedentary villages featuring immense plank houses and elaborate artwork. Totem poles were one marker of the social <span data-type="term">stratification</span> that also distinguished Northwest Coast cultures north of the Columbia River. <span data-type="term">Hereditary</span> elites controlled access to valuable resources, seized captives from enemy groups and made them slaves, and held <span data-type="term">potlatches</span>—lavish ceremonial feasts—to reinforce their high place in society by redistributing surplus food and goods to those of lower status.</p>

<p id="auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_fs-idm229815136">Northwest Coast Indians also traded with Native Americans to the east, on the Columbia Plateau of present-day Oregon and Washington. This region has a semiarid climate that supported smaller human populations in more <span data-type="term">egalitarian</span> societies. Tribes such as the Nez Perce, Yakama, and Okanogan followed a seasonal way of life that took them from semipermanent winter villages to fisheries and foraging areas used by many different Indian nations. Salmon was their major source of protein, but the bulk of their calories came from the wild plant foods gathered by women, who shared a roughly equal amount of power and responsibility with men. Women often led work groups and ceremonial gathering expeditions. They also butchered and cleaned the large amounts of game and fish that were exchanged for other goods in the great, intertribal marketplace on the Columbia River.</p>

<p id="auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_fs-idm244966560">Trade networks linked the Northwest to California, one of the most densely populated and culturally diverse parts of North America. At the time of first contact with the Spanish in 1542, approximately 300,000 Indians occupied the coastal areas and river valleys west of the Sierras. They spoke as many as one hundred different languages but lived a similar lifestyle based on hunting, fishing, and foraging. California’s extensive oak woodlands were an especially important source of food, furnishing perhaps 600,000 tons of acorns annually to gatherers. Women gathered and ground the acorns into a highly nutritious meal, while men hunted and fished.</p>

<p id="auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_fs-idm235217344">The harsh climate and scarce resources of the Great Basin forced the Paiutes, Shoshones, and Utes to move frequently and kept their populations relatively low. At a few locations, such as Pyramid Lake in Nevada, adequate supplies of water and fish did allow sedentary communities to form. Paiutes in the Owens Valley dug irrigation ditches to encourage the growth of edible bulbs. Ute territory in western Colorado and Utah also yielded a greater variety of resources. For most groups, however, survival required seasonal migration to take advantage of changes in the availability of small game, waterfowl, and wild plants. Traveling in small bands or family units, Paiutes and Shoshones stored caches of food and equipment to see them through the winter. Whenever possible, Basin Indians supplemented local products with trade items from beyond the region, including buffalo hides from the Great Plains.</p>

<p id="auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_fs-idm238632688">The Native Americans of the Plains had been hunting bison for centuries. Plains tribes did not have horses until the Spanish brought them from Europe; to slaughter buffalo, they used bluffs or cliffs called buffalo jumps to drive herds to stampede over the edge (<a href="#auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_Figure_01_03_Buffalo" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_fs-idm232892736">The tribes followed the migration of bison and other game animals that filled their bellies, clothed their bodies, sheltered their families, and equipped their toolkits. Buffalo robes also served as a valuable trade item that could be exchanged for corn and other crops. The Pawnee combined <span data-type="term">horticulture</span> and hunting to support permanent earth-lodge villages along the Platte River (in modern Nebraska). In these semi-agrarian societies, women tended the fields and controlled the produce, which gave them economic and social power.</p>

<p id="auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_fs-idm237144624">Maize cultivation, which had spread north from Mexico, also shaped many native cultures of the Southwest. After prolonged droughts undermined the Ancestral Puebloan civilization in the thirteenth century, people migrated east and west to establish the mesa-top Pueblo, Zuni, and Hopi villages that greeted Spanish conquistadors. These societies staged elaborate dances to the spirits known as <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">kachinas</em></span> that they believed brought rain to their fields. All had uneasy relations with the Apache and Navajo bands that moved into the region during the fifteenth century. Although some Navajos cultivated crops in the canyons of northern Arizona, they and the Apache lived primarily by hunting and gathering, and by raiding their agrarian neighbors. They also began herding sheep and goats, which were introduced by the Spanish.</p>

<p id="auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_fs-idm222836784">East of the Mississippi River, epidemics and violence unleashed by Spanish expeditions in the early sixteenth century destabilized the great chiefdoms that had dominated much of the Southeast. The ancestors of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Creek gradually abandoned settlements such as Moundville in Alabama and Etowah in Georgia, where they had built huge earthen pyramids surrounded by plazas, palisades, and farms.</p>

<p id="auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_fs-idm208662656">By the time English colonists arrived on the eastern seaboard, few large chiefdoms existed. One exception was the Powhatan confederacy, which controlled most of eastern Virginia through conquest and diplomacy. Another was the Five Nations, or Iroquois confederacy, in the Northeast. Formed in the centuries before European contact, this “Great League of Peace” ended rampant warfare and established intertribal cooperation among the Mohawk, Oneida, Ononondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca (and later a sixth tribe, the Tuscorora).These Iroquois nations and other tribes of the Eastern Woodlands lived in matrilineal societies (i.e., they traced their ancestry through the female line). They also accorded considerable power to clan mothers, who decided the fate of captives, chose or removed sachems (chiefs), and participated in councils. Because women grew the corn, beans, and squash that sustained war parties, they could withhold food if they deemed an attack to be against Iroquois interests. By the seventeenth century, though, the Five Nations had waged many wars against Algonquian-speaking enemies such as the Delaware, Huron, and Ojibwe. European imperial powers exploited these rivalries by seeking allies in their own wars of conquest, while the Native Americans, in turn, used the Europeans for their own purposes.</p>

<p id="auto_5131f24a-c3fe-4da9-9149-a8d17682783f_fs-idm236175888">Changes were already underway during the sixteenth century as fishermen and merchants from England, France, and other maritime nations began introducing Indians along the Atlantic Coast to exotic goods and exposing them to terrible diseases. Although North America was an old world in 1607, European colonization would soon make it, as one historian wrote, “a new, and often nightmarish, world for Indian peoples.”</p>

<p id="auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_fs-idm280322288">Twelve thousand years ago, rising sea levels submerged the land bridge connecting the Americas and Asia; thus, the Americas developed in isolation from Europe. The first contact between the vastly different cultures of the Europeans and Native Americans represented a rare moment in recorded history, producing impressions that are difficult to alter, even today.</p>

<p id="auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_fs-idm276580960">The first documented European contact with the Americas occurred in North America, when the Vikings established a settlement in Newfoundland on the east coast of Canada around 1000 A.D. Norse legends, or sagas, recount a relationship between Vikings and Native Americans defined by violence and frequent attacks. The reason the Vikings eventually abandoned their Newfoundland settlement is the subject of much scholarly debate. Regardless, it appears the Vikings did not have any lasting impact on Native American societies, and the Americas had little impact on Europeans.</p>

<p id="auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_fs-idm257637456">However, beginning in the fifteenth century, merchant capitalism, the emergence of navigation tools and improved ship designs, and the desire for a sea route westward to the valuable goods in Asia drove Europeans once again into the Atlantic. Iberians—the people of Spain and Portugal—dominated most of these efforts, although the English, French, and Dutch also played a role. All brought with them the expectation of finding trade goods and their preconceived notions of strange humans and barbaric societies, often influenced by fictitious travel accounts circulating in Europe at the time. Following the Vikings, the most important contact between Europeans and the Native Americans in North America was begun by Christopher Columbus, working for Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain (<a href="#auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_Figure_01_03_ColShips" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_fs-idm264388080">Columbus came to the Americas quite by accident in his search for a route west from Europe to Asia. Upon arriving in the Caribbean in 1492, sighting Bahamian islands, and eventually landing in Hispaniola (today Haiti and the Dominican Republic), he believed he had found the islands just southeast of Asia, or the East Indies. According to his own account, the inhabitants, whom he believed were natives of the East Indies, or Indians, brought the Europeans a variety of goods to trade, including parrots, cotton, and spears. The Europeans had brought trinkets such as glass beads and small brass bells. The native populations’ lack of understanding of European weaponry, their nearly naked appearance, and their lack of what Europeans would term civilization led Columbus to report that they “would make fine servants” and that “with fifty men we could subjugate them all” (<a href="#auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_Figure_01_03_Letter" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_fs-idm280092384">Columbus also reported that various Caribbean islands held cannibals, people with tails, and women warriors known as Amazons—descriptions all derived from preconceived notions and tales circulating in Europe at the time. In the end, he took six natives back to Spain as proof of his success.</p>

<p id="auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_fs-idm265406432">For their part, the native populations surely were equally intrigued by the Europeans. Although documentation is mostly lacking, a few reports do exist. Contrary to popular belief, Native Americans did not believe the Europeans were gods. In general, they found the Europeans to be dirty and unkempt and did not care for their food. Certainly, natives adopted specific European goods they deemed most useful, such as metal tools, weapons, and cloth, but it was a selective process and they did not readily adopt much technology. Echoing the Europeans’ opinions of them, the natives viewed many practices and habits of the European newcomers as little less than savage.</p>

<p id="auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_fs-idm250942736">Over the course of his subsequent three voyages to the Caribbean, Columbus established Spanish towns and continued to trade with natives. However, the these Native Americans were <span data-type="term">subsistence</span> farmers and fishers, not producers of valuable exports and commodities. Mistaken expectations held by both Europeans and Native Americans in these first encounters led to outbreaks of violence and abuse. The eventual decimation of the native population was largely due to disease. Yet the settlement of the Spaniards in the Caribbean was a stepping stone to their farther incursions into the Americas.</p>

<p id="auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_fs-idm259039024">Columbus’s third and fourth voyages took him to modern-day Venezuela, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, and sustained contact occurred afterward. In 1500, Spain authorized Rodrigo de Bastidas to explore lands not previously discovered by Columbus. In 1500 and 1501, Bastidas made contact with various Native Americans in Jamaica and Santo Domingo, and traded European trinkets for gold, pearls, and other items. He also acquired Native American slaves. Like Columbus and later Europeans, Bastidas was interested in tradable goods. If the Native Americans possessed them and traded them freely, relations remained peaceful. However, in the absence of valuable goods or trade, violence and slavery typically followed; enslaved people were a marketable good always in high demand throughout the New World.</p>

<p id="auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_fs-idm272218032">The Portuguese discovered Brazil in 1500, but it remained of minor importance to the crown during the first few decades that followed, while peaceful coastal trading of Brazilwood (desired for its red dye) took place with the various Native American groups. French traders also frequented the coast of Brazil until Portugal initiated its colonization effort in 1531. This enterprise endowed portions of land, or captaincies, on individual <span data-type="term">donatories,</span> who settled the land at their own expense in return for the right to create and govern towns, levy taxes, and enslave the Native Americans. As sugar mills began to appear along the coastline, the Native Americans were eventually forced into labor. Slave raiders known as <em data-effect="italics">bandierantes</em> pursued them into the interior as they fled and then enslaved and sold them.</p>

<p id="auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_fs-idm270307008">Yet not all first contacts resulted in the enslavement of the Native Americans. Occasionally, Europeans encountered sedentary native civilizations, cultures like the Aztec, Maya, and Inca that had ready access to valuable trade items and proved more difficult to conquer. In such cases, other Native Americans allied themselves with the Spaniards to pursue their own interests in defeating long-time enemies and rivals and upsetting existing hierarchies of power. For example, the Tlaxcalans took the opportunity to join the Spaniards in overthrowing the Aztec (also called Mexica), who were their warring rivals. Similar alliances occurred throughout central Mexico and Peru.</p>

<p id="auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_fs-idm255597744">Although the Spaniard Hernando de Soto led an expedition into Florida in 1539 and Pedro Menéndez de Avilés established the town of St. Augustine in 1565, the English did not create a successful permanent settlement in the contiguous United States until Jamestown in 1607 in the Chesapeake Bay area. The Jamestown settlers experienced a generally warm initial greeting from the Powhatan people. Yet their permanent presence and continuous exploration provoked a series of attacks from neighboring groups of Native Americans. Along with starvation and disease, such attacks nearly defeated the colony in its first year. This strained first contact foreshadowed a difficult relationship between Europeans and Native Americans, culminating in a surprise attack on Jamestown by the Powhatan nation in 1622. Nearly 350 settlers were killed, spelling disaster for relations between Europeans and American Indians.</p>

<p id="auto_41f1c31a-ba90-4f46-a42f-f106be7ba6f9_fs-idm270236064">The relationships originating from first contact between Europeans and American Indians were complex and varied and should not be viewed as <span data-type="term">monolithic</span>. In general, when Native Americans possessed goods or land they were willing to trade to Europeans, relations remained peaceful. The absence of such commodities, however, often led to violence and slavery. This pattern is not new. In fact, it has been replicated worldwide since the rise of civilizations.</p>

<p id="auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_fs-idm232599920">When European settlers sailed for distant places during the Renaissance, they carried a variety of items, visible and invisible. Upon arriving in the Caribbean in 1492, Christopher Columbus and his crew brought with them several different trading goods. Yet they also carried unseen biological organisms. And so did every European, African, and Native American who wittingly or unwittingly took part in the Columbian Exchange—the transfer of plants, animals, humans, cultures, germs, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World. The result was a biological and ideological mixing unprecedented in the history of the planet, and one that forever shaped the cultures that participated.</p>

<p id="auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_fs-idm226370544">For tens of millions of years, the earth’s people and animals developed in relative isolation from one another. Geographic obstacles such as oceans, rainforests, and mountains prevented the interaction of different species of animals and plants and their spread to other regions. The first settlers of the Americas, who probably crossed the Bering Strait’s ice bridge that connected modern-day Russia and Alaska thousands of years ago, brought plants, animals, and germs with them from Eurasia. However, scholars have speculated that the frigid climate of Siberia—the likely origin of the Native Americans— limited the variety of species. And although the Vikings made contact with the Americas around 1000, their impact was limited.</p>

<p id="auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_fs-idm208635264">A large variety of new flora and fauna was introduced to the New World and the Old World in the Columbian Exchange. New World crops included maize (corn), chiles, tobacco, white and sweet potatoes, peanuts, tomatoes, papaya, pineapples, squash, pumpkins, and avocados. New World cultures domesticated only a few animals, including some small-dog species, guinea pigs, llamas, and a few species of fowl. Such animals were domesticated largely for their use as food and not as beasts of burden. For their part, Old World inhabitants were busily cultivating onions, lettuce, rye, barley, rice, oats, turnips, olives, pears, peaches, citrus fruits, sugarcane, and wheat. They too domesticated animals for their use as food, including pigs, sheep, cattle, fowl, and goats. However, cows also served as beasts of burden, along with horses and donkeys. Domesticated dogs were also used for hunting and recreation.</p>

<p id="auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_fs-idm222964752">The lack of domesticated animals not only hampered Native Americans development of labor-saving technologies, it also limited their exposure to disease organisms and thus their immunity to illness. Europeans, however, had long been exposed to the various diseases carried by animals, as well as others often shared through living in close quarters in cities, including measles, cholera, bubonic plague, typhoid, influenza, and smallpox.</p>

<p id="auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_fs-idm238546384">Europeans had also traveled great distances for centuries and had been introduced to many of the world’s diseases, most notably bubonic plague during the Black Death. They thus gained immunity to most diseases as advances in ship technology enabled them to travel even farther during the Renaissance. The inhabitants of the New World did not have the same travel capabilities and lived on isolated continents where they did not encounter many diseases.</p>

<p id="auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_fs-idm241393664">All this changed with Columbus’s first voyage in 1492. When he returned to Spain a year later, Columbus brought with him six Taino natives as well as a few species of birds and plants. The Columbian exchange was underway (<a href="#auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_BRI_APUSH_01_03_NewWorld" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). On his second voyage, Columbus brought wheat, radishes, melons, and chickpeas to the Caribbean. His travels opened an Atlantic highway between the New and Old Worlds that never closed and only expanded as the exchange of goods increased exponentially year after year. Although Europeans exported their wheat bread, olive oil, and wine in the first years after contact, soon wheat and other goods were being grown in the Americas too. Indeed, wheat remains an important staple in North and South America.</p>

<p id="auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_fs-idm238260608">Horses, cattle, goats, chickens, sheep, and pigs likewise made their New World debut in the early years of contact, to forever shape its landscapes and cultures. On the lusher grasslands of the Americas, imported populations of horses, cattle, and sheep exploded in the absence of natural predators for these animals in the New World. In central Mexico, native farmers who had never needed fences complained about the roaming livestock that frequently damaged their crops. The Mapuche of Chile integrated the horse into their culture so well that they became an insurmountable force opposing the Spaniards. The introduction of horses also changed the way Native Americans hunted buffalo on the Great Plains and made them formidable warriors against other tribes.</p>

<p id="auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_fs-idm214082816">The Atlantic highway was not one way, and certainly the New World influenced the Old World. For example, the higher caloric value of potatoes and corn brought from the Americas improved the diet of peasants throughout Europe, as did squash, pumpkins, and tomatoes. This, is turn, led to a net population increase in Europe. Tobacco helped sustain the economy of the first permanent English colony in Jamestown when smoking was introduced and became wildly popular in Europe. Chocolate also enjoyed widespread popularity throughout Europe, where elites frequently enjoyed it served hot as a beverage. A few diseases were also shared with Europeans, including bacterial infections such as syphilis, which Spanish troops from the New World spread across European populations when their nation went to war in Italy and elsewhere.</p>

<p id="auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_fs-idm222960304">By contrast, Old World diseases wreaked havoc on native populations. Aztec drawings known as codices show Native Americans dying from the telltale symptoms of smallpox. With no previous exposure and no immunities, the Native American population probably declined by as much as 90 percent in the 150 years after Columbus’s first voyage. The Spanish and other Europeans had no way of knowing they carried deadly microbes with them, but diseases such as measles, influenza, typhus, malaria, diphtheria, whooping cough, and, above all, smallpox were perhaps the most destructive force in the conquest of the New World.</p>

<p id="auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_fs-idm230000704">Contact and conquest also led to the blending of ideas and culture. European priests and friars preached Christianity to the Native Americans, who in turn adopted and adapted its beliefs. For instance, the Catholic celebration of All Souls and All Saints Day was blended with an Aztec festival honoring the dead; the resulting Day of the Dead festivities combined elements of Spanish Catholicism and Native American beliefs to create something new. The influence of Christianity was long-lasting; Latin America became overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.</p>

<p id="auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_fs-idm226382288">People also blended in this Columbian Exchange. The Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans in the New World procreated, resulting in offspring of mixed race (<a href="#auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_BRI_APUSH_01_03_Races" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_ff3d527a-7f54-43b3-bc09-13d4a43894b4_fs-idm226251648">Throughout the colonial period, native cultures influenced Spanish settlers, producing a <span data-type="term">mestizo</span> identity. Mestizos took pride in both their pre-Columbian and their Spanish heritage and created images such as the Virgin of Guadalupe—a brown-skinned, Latin American Mary who differed from her lighter-skinned European predecessors. The Virgin of Guadalupe became the patron saint of the Americas and the most popular among Catholic saints in general. Above all, she remains an enduring example and evidence of the Columbian Exchange.</p>

<p id="auto_7123cc1b-f3ae-45eb-87a4-634a459e9bf9_fs-idm280087264">Hernando de Soto was born in the late fifteenth century to noble parents in western Extremadura in Spain. The region was home to other famous <span data-type="term">conquistadors</span>, including Hernando Cortés and the Pizarro brothers. De Soto’s social status allowed him some education, and he became literate. Yet a life in Spain seemed too placid to him, and in his late teens he embarked for the New World for the first time.</p>

<p id="auto_7123cc1b-f3ae-45eb-87a4-634a459e9bf9_fs-idm259615456">De Soto joined other ambitious young men seeking advancement, wealth, and prestige through conquest in the “Indies” after the arrival of Columbus in 1492. He left Spain in 1514 with the expedition of Pedro Arí­as de Ávila, also known as Pedrária Dávila, and landed in Darién (modern Panama) in Central America. He spent most of his career in the region participating in various campaigns of conquest and settlement, and his efforts were awarded with an <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">encomienda</em></span>, a grant of Native Americans’ tribute and labor given by the crown to Spaniards in Nicaragua. De Soto profited from slave trading, but he lacked the status of other conquistadors, such as Hernando Cortés, whose conquest of the Aztecs was becoming widely known. Soon, however, de Soto would get his chance for greater fame.</p>

<p id="auto_7123cc1b-f3ae-45eb-87a4-634a459e9bf9_fs-idm250904944">In 1530, de Soto invested in the efforts of Francisco Pizarro to scout the Pacific coast for gold. In 1532, he joined Pizarro’s expedition to Peru and contributed enough men and money to become a captain. As the expedition reached the city of Cajamarca in the Peruvian highlands, the men encountered the army of the Inca emperor, Atahualpa. By all accounts, de Soto was a skilled equestrian and fighter. Not surprisingly then, Pizarro chose him and a few other men to invite Atahualpa to a meeting set for the next day. At this fateful encounter, de Soto and the Spanish soldiers attacked the Inca emperor and his <span data-type="term">retinue</span> without provocation in a slaughter that resulted in Atahualpa’s capture (<a href="#auto_7123cc1b-f3ae-45eb-87a4-634a459e9bf9_BRI_APUSH_01_03_Conquista" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_7123cc1b-f3ae-45eb-87a4-634a459e9bf9_fs-idm277498848">Seizing Native American rulers was a common tactic of conquistadors throughout the New World, who needed gold and silver to pay for their incursions and make them profitable. Observing the Spaniards’ interest in precious metals, Atahualpa offered to fill a room once with gold and twice with silver in return for his freedom. De Soto’s lofty position among the conquistadors was confirmed by his share of this ransom—it was the third largest after those of Francisco and Hernando Pizarro. The windfall and his role in the subsequent conquest of the Inca and their capital city of Cuzco plucked de Soto from relative obscurity and firmly established him as a leading conquistador.</p>

<p id="auto_7123cc1b-f3ae-45eb-87a4-634a459e9bf9_fs-idm263791616">Yet de Soto remained unsatisfied. Despite serving as lieutenant governor of Cuzco and living in a palace built by a former Inca emperor, he desired his own command and expedition to a territory in the New World. So in 1536 he left Peru and returned to Spain a wealthy man to lobby the crown for such a command. There he was fortunate enough to marry Isabel de Bobadillo, the well-connected daughter of Pedrárias Dávila, and be admitted into the highly prestigious military-religious order of knights, the Order of Santiago. After petitioning King Charles V for various concessions, de Soto was granted the governorship of Cuba in 1537 and was made <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">adelantado</em></span> of Florida. He was also rewarded with the title of marquis in anticipation of his efforts in conquering and settling regions in the New World.</p>

<p id="auto_7123cc1b-f3ae-45eb-87a4-634a459e9bf9_fs-idm270129408">After the discovery of the wealth of the Aztec and Inca empires, many Spaniards were hopeful of finding the next Native American kingdom of riches. This enthusiasm inspired many to join de Soto’s 1539 expedition to Florida, including some who had been in Peru with him. The campaign was sizeable; accounts vary, but approximately 650 to 800 men signed on, including Spaniards, Portuguese, enslaved Africans, free blacks, enslaved Native Americans, and free Native Americans.</p>

<p id="auto_7123cc1b-f3ae-45eb-87a4-634a459e9bf9_fs-idm277062016">De Soto’s experience in Florida was a mix of peaceful and violent encounters with Native Americans. The swampy terrain proved difficult for the men and the more than two hundred horses they brought with them. Like most conquest expeditions, de Soto’s relied on Native American captives to serve as translators and even a Spaniard, Juan Ortiz, who had been captured by Native Americans in Florida years before and now knew two native dialects. Those Native Americans with whom he did communicate at times led de Soto to believe that treasures were to be had elsewhere, a useful tactic to ensure the Spanish departure. Thus, de Soto and his men wandered, searching in vain for riches and kingdoms that did not exist.</p>

<p id="auto_7123cc1b-f3ae-45eb-87a4-634a459e9bf9_fs-idm260143520">In 1542, de Soto died of an unknown illness on what is today the Louisiana/Arkansas border. The remainder of his force—now reduced by half, largely due to illness and attacks by Native Americans—gave up the expedition and made a laborious voyage to Mexico City, arriving in 1543.</p>

<p id="auto_7123cc1b-f3ae-45eb-87a4-634a459e9bf9_fs-idm262224624">Although it was considered a failure that damaged de Soto’s reputation, the expedition journeyed through what are today eleven states in the American southeast and crossed the Mississippi River. Moreover, the Spanish presence in the region had many unintended consequences. The exposure to European disease (and violence) often resulted in high population loss among the Native Americans and the abandonment of villages, and it set a precedent for future Native American and European interactions. Deserters of de Soto’s expedition included free and enslaved Africans. In one example, after the Spaniards had captured a native <em data-effect="italics">cacica</em>, or female ruler, an African slave named Gómez helped her escape to present-day Camden, South Carolina, and became her companion. Scholars argue that the Native American nations in the Spanish-claimed territory of La Florida provided a potential haven for runaway slaves over the next three centuries.</p>

<p id="auto_7123cc1b-f3ae-45eb-87a4-634a459e9bf9_fs-idm253176656">Finally, de Soto’s failed expedition dampened enthusiasm for future forays into the region, resulting in Florida’s sparse settlement by the Spanish and its eventual cession to the United States in 1821. After all, Spaniards preferred to settle on or near <span data-type="term">sedentary</span> Native American settlements that provided easy access to Native American tribute and labor. Thus, they concentrated mainly on central Mexico (held by the Aztecs) and Peru (the Inca) throughout the colonial period. Regions such as the American Southeast held little appeal to exploring conquistadors, who were always looking for the next “Mexico” or “Peru” instead.</p>

    <div data-type="exercise-stimulus"><p>“[A] loss of time. . . . obliged me to send Vasco Parcallo de Figueroa, my lieutenant general, with the brigantines to take possession of a village at the foot of the bay, and I ordered him to land all the troops and horses there. . . .</p>
<p>As soon as I landed I was informed that a Christian was in the power of a cacique [chief] of the country. I accordingly dispatched . . . forty horsemen and as many foot soldiers, to bring him into camp. After marching a day's journey he overtook the Christian in company with eight or ten Indians . . . I was much pleased with this good fortune, for this man knew the language of the country, although he had almost forgotten his own. His name is Juan Ortiz, a gentleman of Seville. I afterwards went in person to the cacique of this province, and learned from him that his intentions were entirely pacific. I then dispatched Baltasar de Gallegos with eighty lancers and one hundred foot soldiers, to reconnoitre the country. He found it cultivated with fields of Indian corn, beans, pumpkins, and other vegetables, sufficient for the supply of a large army. Having arrived at a cacique's called Hurripacuxi, who is the chief of several provinces, I negotiated with him a treaty of peace, which he broke very soon after. I had him immediately arrested, with seventeen others, among whom were several old men, who were influential with the Indians, and acquainted with the interior of the country. They told me that after three days' journey I would come to a country well peopled and cultivated, and to a large city called Aquerra; and after two more days' we should reach another city called Ocale, where it would be pleasant for us to spend the winter.”</p>

<p id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_fs-idm226468976">The reliance of Spain on the cooperation, tribute, and labor of Native Americans and Africans drastically shaped life in colonial Spanish America. Daily life was a complex combination of compliance and rebellion, order and disorder, affluence and poverty. On the one hand, Spaniards relied on Native Americans for labor, tribute, and assistance in governing the many Native American towns. On the other hand, many Native Americans realized the benefits of accommodating the Spaniards to maintain traditional ways of life. In short, cooperation served the interests of both parties, although it was negotiated daily.</p>

<p id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_fs-idm236148592">Upon their arrival in the New World, Spaniards constructed their colonies and cities upon or alongside established Native American communities such as the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan (<a href="#auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_BRI_APUSH_01_03_Tenochitl" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), on the site that later became Mexico City. To establish political and economic control over their new colonies, the Spaniards created two “republics”: the <em data-effect="italics">República de Españoles</em> and the <em data-effect="italics">República de Indios</em>. They and their enslaved Africans (and even free Africans) were in the first, and Native Americans were in the second. Although both republics fell under the purview of Spanish law, they operated semi-autonomously, with each established town having its own town council. For example, Mexico City had both a Spanish and a Native American town council.</p>

<p id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_fs-idm234643536">The town councils governed the daily affairs of each town and its inhabitants in each respective republic. Councils in Native American towns were run by Native American officers, often those who already held positions of power. For example, the Maya ruler in most preexisting Maya towns became the governor of the colonial town council. The Native American nobility in each town filled other local government positions. In short, the establishment of the republics, their towns, and their respective town councils allowed the Native Americans a great deal of autonomy and gave the original Native American elite a way to maintain their positions of authority in daily life. The Spanish relied heavily on these Native American elites not only to maintain order in the towns but also to redirect their systems of tribute into the hands of the Spaniards and assist in the establishment of Catholicism in their towns.</p>

<p id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_fs-idm217270928">As subjects of Spain, Native Americans had various daily responsibilities. As Christians, they were to attend services and send their children to daily catechism classes. They also paid various religious fees and taxes designed to support the Church in the Spanish colonies. Local priests and officers of the Inquisition (a Roman Catholic tribunal established to investigate and suppress heresy) maintained spiritual order and orthodoxy among all inhabitants of the colonies. In addition, Native Americans had labor and tribute quotas to fill. Such duties provided many opportunities for confrontation and discontent, and the local Native American elite adjudicated many such situations through the town council. Indeed, the archives are full of petitions by Native American councils against corrupt priests and Spanish officials and complaints against excessive tribute quotas. Yet the council likewise mediated local affairs, including land disputes, bills of sale, and the filling of town positions. It even meted out punishments for wrongdoing. In many ways, the town councils in the <em data-effect="italics">República de Indios</em> allowed Native Americans to continue governing Native Americans.</p>

<p id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_fs-idm238467248">To govern and tax the Native Americans in the early decades of colonization, the Spanish relied on the <em data-effect="italics">encomienda</em>, a grant of native labor and tribute given to Spanish conquistadors and settlers. Abuse and distrust of the system led to its gradual and sometimes incomplete phasing out, with control over Native American tribute and labor reverting to the crown, which tried to control corrupt colonial officials.</p>

<p id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_fs-idm242297472">Tribute varied according to region and era but included mainly goods Spaniards could ship back to Spain for profit or sell on the local or regional market. Products presented as tribute included maize from Culhuacan, silk from the Mixteca Alta region, honey from Yucatan, pearls from the Caribbean, gold from Columbia, and even cattle from Argentina. After the initial years of colonization, Spaniards in central Mexico organized Native American labor around the <em data-effect="italics">repartimiento</em>, or “allotment,” system. The <em data-effect="italics">repartimiento</em> required those between the ages of eighteen and fifty years to give service in a variety of projects, from laboring in a Spaniard’s field to participating in large construction projects. The Native Americans were to receive payment for their labors, but it was often insufficient or withheld. In South America, labor was organized through the <em data-effect="italics">mita,</em> an Incan system in which adult Native Americans were drafted for extended periods. For example, the silver mines of Potosí required the labor of thousands of Andean laborers, who were drafted from towns hundreds of miles away and required to serve one year of every seven (<a href="#auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_BRI_APUSH_01_03_Capitulo" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Eventually, the decline in the Native American population and difficulties with the forced-labor system led to the development of wage labor.</p>

<figure id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_BRI_APUSH_01_03_Capitulo" class="scaled-down-60"><figcaption>The rich silver deposits of the Cerro Rico mountain in Potosi, in present-day Bolivia, supplied Spain with immense wealth in the sixteenth century. The Spanish appropriated the Incan system of labor tribute known as the <em data-effect="italics">mita</em> to ensure a constant source of labor in the mines.</figcaption>

<p id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_fs-idm222356912">Although Native American tribute and labor served as the linchpin of colonial society, Africans also contributed to the daily life of the Spanish colonies. In general, Spaniards employed native labor whenever possible. However, where the supply was insufficient, they purchased African slaves to work in the more profitable industries such as mining and sugar. For example, after the decimation of the native population in the Caribbean, Spaniards brought thousands of enslaved people from West Africa to work the islands’ sugarcane fields. This drastically altered the Caribbean’s population demographics. Not all enslaved Africans worked in the mines or sugar plantations. In the cities and large towns, they were rented out and served in other domestic roles, including as wet nurses and maids. Africans also learned the skilled trades of their owners and became proficient tailors, blacksmiths, and artisans.</p>

<p id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_fs-idm246095936">Because Spanish law allowed an enslaved person to purchase his or her own freedom, Spain’s colonies boasted a sizeable portion of free blacks who engaged in myriad trades; freed slaves became sailors, merchants, and even slave owners. Many joined militias and defended thousands of miles of coastline along the Spanish colonies against pirates—another common element of life in the colonies. They served in return for a salary, social advancement, and tax exemption. Moreover, free Africans formed their own Catholic brotherhoods—common among Spaniards and Native Americans—that supported an African-Christian worldview while providing monetary support for members by funding funerals and celebrations and even serving as banks.</p>

<p id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_fs-idm224595136">Spanish cities and the activities within them modeled those found in Europe. Like their counterparts in Spain, the capitals of Mexico City and Lima housed universities, cathedrals, exquisite homes, central courthouses, and exclusive shopping. Cards, music, books, plays, bullfights, and parties occupied the time of the elite. Poorer citizens also partook in such activities but on a smaller scale, enjoying local ballads, cockfights, and town gatherings on feast days. The elite dined on wheat bread, olive oil, cured meats, and wine, while commoners ate maize tortillas, manioc, chilies, turkeys, and small dogs, and drank the local indigenous intoxicant. Cities boasted the most refinement and Spanish influence, whereas the countryside was denigrated for its overwhelming “Indian” feel.</p>

<p id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_fs-idm235290448">Throughout the colonial period, sexual relations between different people from the Americas, Europe, and Africa created a growing mixed-race population known as the <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">castas</em></span> (<a href="#auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_BRI_APUSH_01_03_Casta" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Disregarded as a minor inconvenience at first, the <em data-effect="italics">castas</em> eventually threatened the social hierarchy. The Spanish sought to maintain themselves at the top and keep Native Americans and Africans at the bottom, whereas the <em data-effect="italics">castas</em> were allowed a place somewhere in the middle. In daily life, however, people were often racially categorized by how well they spoke Spanish, how they dressed, what food they ate, or their social circle of acquaintances. As a result, in practice, the hierarchy allowed for some flexibility.</p>

<figure id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_BRI_APUSH_01_03_Casta" class="full-width"><figcaption><em data-effect="italics">Castas</em> paintings from the mid-1700s document the cultural blending seen in Spanish colonies.

<p id="auto_19b0414b-38c6-4e4d-b288-b928ca33062b_fs-idm246316608">Perhaps this flexibility best reflects life in the Spanish colonies. It consisted of specific obligations, religious institutions, and social hierarchies, to be sure. Yet Native Americans, Africans, and Spaniards negotiated their own experiences, from conformity to resistance, within these limits. Most lived somewhere between the two extremes, doing their best to adapt their traditional ways of life to a diverse colonial world.</p>

<p id="auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_fs-idm230100336">In 1734, British sea captain William Snelgrave stated that Africans had been trafficking in slaves long before the Europeans arrived and explained the various ways Africans could become enslaved in their native country. Slavery could result from crimes committed or unpaid debts; parents could also sell their children into slavery. Yet the most common source of slavery was the taking of war captives by an enemy tribe or state. Snelgrave argued that the slave trade between Europeans and Africans was moral and just and, in fact, benefitted the African slaves. According to him, Europeans had an economic incentive to treat slaves better than their African counterparts because of the expense incurred in their purchase. Furthermore, European slavers would introduce African slaves to Christianity, thus saving their souls for eternity. Many Europeans shared Snelgrave’s opinions, as did the Catholic Church and its popes, who issued several decrees concerning Africa beginning in the mid-fifteenth century and authorizing the enslavement of non-Christians.</p>

<p id="auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_fs-idm235295968">Although grossly exaggerating the improved treatment of slaves by Europeans, Snelgrave was right in that the slave trade was just that: a trade. Contrary to popular understanding, Europeans were generally prevented by disease and Africans wielding metal weapons from raiding the African continent and stealing away people they then enslaved. These limitations forced them to deal with Africans as equal business partners. After all, the business of slavery had existed in Africa and been controlled by the African elite since the seventh century. Some historians estimate that, before the arrival of the Europeans in the fifteenth century, Africans had sold upward of eleven million slaves to the Islamic world. When the Portuguese arrived on the coast of Africa, African merchants and rulers were more than happy to exchange enslaved Africans for various commodities. In other words, Europeans simply accessed the preexisting systems of slave trading and provided a new means of transport across the Atlantic to the Americas.</p>

<p id="auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_fs-idm239146976">It is important to view slavery and its deep history not as a “white” versus “black” racial issue, but as a longstanding example of “us” versus “them” exploitation. Slavery has existed in various forms since at least ancient times and throughout many world cultures. Before the Industrial Revolution, the invention of advanced labor-saving technology, and the development of markets for free labor, forced or coerced human labor was used by civilizations from Sumeria, Egypt, and Greece to Rome, and eventually African and European nations. Cultures and nations routinely used other cultures and nations deemed different or inferior as sources of slaves. In other words, European and African involvement in a slave trade was just one link in an already long chain of examples.</p>

<p id="auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_fs-idm232245536">In Africa, slaves served in a variety of roles. Some worked on the agricultural estates of nobles and kings; some served in domestic roles or as indicators of wealth and prestige; some performed hard labor in gold mines or as soldiers; and others served as artisans, concubines, tutors, and in many other roles. Slaves in Africa were seen as a form of property, and slave markets abounded throughout west and central Africa. The all-too-real danger of becoming enslaved due to violent raids by other Africans prompted many African communities to use the natural geography of cliffs, lakes, mountains, and caves, and the construction of walls around communities, towns, and cities to protect themselves from aggressive neighbors.</p>

<p id="auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_fs-idm235927488">The discovery of the Americas and the increased demand for the labor-intensive production of sugar led to an increased European demand for slaves, and Africa provided the perfect solution. Not only was it close to the trade routes going west to the Americas but it had a preexisting system of slavery that facilitated the trade. Business-savvy African merchants and rulers knew they held a product highly valued by Europeans and adjusted their price accordingly. Some demanded <span data-type="term">cowry shells</span> for their slaves; others requested European goods such as rum, tobacco, guns, iron bars, axes, knives, and textiles. These goods enhanced the prestige of their African owners while also providing a military advantage over their rivals.</p>

<p id="auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_fs-idm225671488">A typical slave-trading venture might begin with a European ship captain, before his departure, obtaining from his government the necessary permissions and paying the necessary fees to trade in slaves. He would hire a crew and check the local ports for men returning from Africa to ascertain the current value of slaves and the goods African traders sought. After purchasing supplies and desired trade items, he would set sail for the African coast. For their part, African rulers and merchants would acquire slaves, often through violent raids, and bring them to coastal forts, such as the one shown in <a href="#auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_BRI_APUSH_01_03_Elmina" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, to be held until they were purchased by Europeans.</p>

<figure id="auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_BRI_APUSH_01_03_Elmina" class="full-width"><figcaption>In 1482, Portuguese traders built Elmina Castle (also called São Jorge da Mina, or Saint George’s of the Mine) in present-day Ghana, on the west coast of Africa. Originally the fort was used to trade gold, but by the sixteenth century it was serving as a holding pen for enslaved Africans waiting to board ships that would take them to the Americas. This image of the Elmina dates from the 1660s, when the fort had been seized by Dutch traders.</figcaption>

<p id="auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_fs-idm233926848">Having arrived, the European captain would likely offer “gifts” or pay “dues” to the local African traders and kings in exchange for the opportunity to trade with them. The captain would then purchase as many slaves as the African merchants had available and continue this process all along the coastline as he sailed to various vendors until he had purchased his desired number of slaves. A trip could last weeks or even months, depending on the number of enslaved people available at each stop.</p>

<p id="auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_fs-idm237573696">During the purchasing process, the crew outfitted the boat for its trans-Atlantic voyage. They installed planks in the storage hold on which to keep the slaves, and nets around the deck to prevent escape or suicide. Enslaved people spent the hellish voyage across the Atlantic Ocean shackled together in the cramped, dark, and foul confines below deck (<a href="#auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_BRI_APUSH_01_03_SlaveShip" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Approximately 10 to 15 percent of the 12 million Africans in the slave trade—more than one million people—died on the voyage of disease, mistreatment, or suicide.</p>

<p id="auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_fs-idm246082192">Known as the “<span data-type="term">Middle Passage</span>” of the triangular trade between Europe, Africa, and the Americas, the ordeal took one to two months. After arriving in the Americas, the captain would sell his slaves for local goods including cotton, rum, sugar, dyes, and logwood. These goods would then be transported back to Europe for sale. Although European and African slavers saw the slave trade as beneficial and lucrative, the Africans who had been kidnapped and enslaved suffered inhumane exploitation, mistreatment, and denial of the fundamental individual rights to life, liberty, and ownership of their labor and themselves.</p>

<p id="auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_fs-idm233086352">Before 1820, four of every five people bound for North or South America arrived in chains. Once purchased and transported from Africa, slaves ended up in a variety of places. A small portion was taken to Europe. Nearly one-third of slaves were sent to Brazil, which received more than four million slaves to work on its numerous sugar plantations, to mine and pan for gold, and eventually to grow coffee. Caribbean islands owned by the British, French, and Dutch likewise received millions of slaves, as did Spanish America, where enslaved people commonly worked in the mines, in artisan trades, and around ports as laborers and sailors. Contrary to popular belief, British North America received only about six percent of the captives transported in the slave trade (<a href="#auto_61bbd21b-f88d-4d8a-98af-67b00db9af3c_BRI_APUSH_01_03_SlaveTrade" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Demand was greater in the sugar islands of the Caribbean, whereas North American labor needs were met, in part, by white indentured servants and a naturally reproducing slave population. In the end, however, Africa and Europe worked together to supply the Americas with their primary source of immigrants in the colonial period: African slaves.</p>

<p id="auto_a146631e-0a12-4f30-a3a6-2d5adaf19529_fs-idm231354032">In early April 1609, the 80-ton <em data-effect="italics">Halve Maen</em> (the “Half Moon”) sailed from the Dutch commercial capital of Amsterdam toward the frozen seas of the Arctic Ocean. The ship’s captain was seeking a quicker northeast passage around Russia for access to the valuable spices and other riches of the East Indies. The great powers of Europe were locked in a worldwide struggle for empire that included competing for the vast wealth associated with the Asian trade. The intrepid captain of the ship, Henry Hudson, was determined to be the first to chart a path through the Arctic ice—or perhaps he had other discoveries in mind.</p>

<p id="auto_a146631e-0a12-4f30-a3a6-2d5adaf19529_fs-idm238580976">Hudson was an Englishman who found employment as a ship captain for the Dutch. He was sailing familiar waters with his Dutch and English crew. In the previous two years, he had twice tried to discover a northeast passage for the English East India Company. Merchants in several countries were looking for an alternative to sailing around Africa, because the long journey increased the dangers posed by weather, piracy, and diseases like scurvy. Hudson’s voyage was sponsored by Dutch merchants who would soon form the Dutch East India Company. Although the monarchs of some European nations used government funds to sponsor voyages, these entrepreneurial merchants, acting with the permission of their governments, formed and invested in privately owned <span data-type="term">joint-stock companies</span> that launched voyages of exploration in search of profit. The investors split the profit and paid a share to the crown.</p>

<p id="auto_a146631e-0a12-4f30-a3a6-2d5adaf19529_fs-idm241124352">Hudson sailed into the Barents Sea north of Scandinavia but soon found the ice impassable. After some bickering among the officers and crew about their next destination, the captain persuaded them to sail across the Atlantic and search for the fabled Northwest Passage that had captured the imaginations of so many mariners, investors, and monarchs of Europe (<a href="#auto_a146631e-0a12-4f30-a3a6-2d5adaf19529_BRI_APUSH_01_03_NWPassage" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Over the past century, several Spanish, English, and French explorers had probed just about every broad river they encountered along North America’s Atlantic coast in hopes that it would provide a water route through the continent. Hudson was drawn to North America by the same ambition of being the first to sail directly to the East Indies, although not by the path his investors had directed.</p>

<p id="auto_a146631e-0a12-4f30-a3a6-2d5adaf19529_fs-idm232742480">In early July, the <em data-effect="italics">Halve Maen</em> reached Newfoundland, where Hudson and his crew encountered a French fishing fleet hauling in cod. The sailors aboard the Dutch ship caught and salted dozens of cod for their journey, and Hudson eventually plied the officers of another French vessel for information about the coast. The <em data-effect="italics">Halve Maen</em> also made contact with Native Americans in or near Nova Scotia; Hudson traded knives, kettles, clothing, and beads for beaver skins and other furs. He heard tales of gold and silver, and possibly the Northwest Passage. However, because his men feared the Native Americans had stolen items from the ship, they went ashore and raided the native village. It was an ominous start to Hudson’s relationship with the indigenous people of North America.</p>

<p id="auto_a146631e-0a12-4f30-a3a6-2d5adaf19529_fs-idm224585216">By early August, the <em data-effect="italics">Halve Maen</em> had spotted Cape Cod and traded with more Native Americans for tobacco and meat. A few weeks later, the ship arrived at the eastern shore of Virginia, but Hudson quickly sailed away rather than exploring the Chesapeake Bay and risking trouble with the new English colony at Jamestown. After repairing damage the ship had suffered in storms, the <em data-effect="italics">Halve Maen’s</em> crew sailed to New York in early September. Hudson then traveled what is now the Upper New York Bay for a couple of weeks and had many trading encounters with different local Native American tribes.</p>

<p id="auto_a146631e-0a12-4f30-a3a6-2d5adaf19529_fs-idm241490208">On these occasions, the Native Americans generally paddled over to the ship in several large canoes with items for trade. Some came aboard, invited and not, to trade tobacco, oysters, furs, wheat, and corn for knives, hatchets, and beads. After the crew grew suspicious of some Natives American and chased them from the ship, however, a group of Munsees attacked one night. Three sailors were injured, one of whom was shot through the throat with an arrow and died. The Europeans were even more wary and cautious after this violent exchange and were prepared to use their muskets and cannons should further violence ensue. They may also have abducted a few Native Americans, who later escaped.</p>

<p id="auto_a146631e-0a12-4f30-a3a6-2d5adaf19529_fs-idm223286608">Hudson was pleased at the prospect that one of the rivers—the Hudson that would later be named for him—was the Northwest Passage. The <em data-effect="italics">Halve Maen</em> sailed up this river, passing the Peekskills and the Hudson Highlands. The crew traded cautiously with Native Americans along the way, especially the Mahicans at Catskill Creek. They sailed all the way to modern-day Albany and went ashore to trade with Native Americans, who sought wampum (strings or belts of purple and white shells used as currency). The crew also introduced the Native Americans to alcohol.</p>

<p id="auto_a146631e-0a12-4f30-a3a6-2d5adaf19529_fs-idm231456624">The ship finally reached shallows and was forced to turn around. As Hudson sailed back down the Hudson, a trading encounter with the Indians turned violent when a Native American climbed aboard the ship and stole some items. A sailor shot him in the chest and killed him, after which the other Native Americans on the ship jumped into the water and were chased by sailors in a small boat. When the Indians in the river tried to overturn the boat, a sailor cut off the hand of one, causing the Indian to drown. Two canoes assaulted the ship, and word spread quickly for additional warriors to join the attack. As more than one hundred Native Americans shot arrows from canoes and the nearby shore, the sailors opened up with a cannon and killed three. A few other Native Americans were cut down by cannon and musket fire while a hail of arrows flew ineffectively against the crew.</p>

<p id="auto_a146631e-0a12-4f30-a3a6-2d5adaf19529_fs-idm234199600">The <em data-effect="italics">Halve Maen</em> reached what is now Manhattan by early October, and Hudson and his crew again faced a decision. Hudson wanted to continue searching for the Northwest Passage and winter in North America, but the crew was strongly opposed. So Hudson reluctantly sailed into the Atlantic bound for Europe. The ship reached Dartmouth, England, in early November, and, curiously, Hudson went to London to report on his voyage rather than returning to his employers in Amsterdam. Perhaps the English detained him and prevented him from going to Amsterdam because they were trying to gain a competitive advantage in the struggle for empire. Whatever the case, Hudson sailed to North America for the English the following year on the <em data-effect="italics">Discovery</em>, but he was stranded with his son and some other crew members in a mutiny and was never seen again.</p>

<p id="auto_a146631e-0a12-4f30-a3a6-2d5adaf19529_fs-idm225671488">The Dutch established their first permanent fur-trading post near modern-day Albany, New York, in 1614. For a decade, the post had fewer than 50 inhabitants. In 1625, the Dutch West India Company established New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island as a fortified town to guard the Hudson River and the fur trade against any competing European powers. The company selected a governor, Pieter Stuyvesant, who presided over the settlement. New Amsterdam’s policy of religious toleration invited the growth of a religiously and ethnically diverse group of settlers. Eventually, the Dutch colony was caught up in the Anglo-Dutch wars in the mid-seventeenth century and was lost in 1664 when English warships forced its surrender. The Netherlands ceded “New York,” as it came to be known, to England a few years later.</p>

</div>

<p id="auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_fs-idm254579760">The ninth ruler of the Aztec Empire, Montezuma, was not overly concerned by the report he had just received. For the past few years, his spies had been informing him of the activities of the Spanish and their expeditions. Now, in 1519, a report came to him of another group of foreign men coming from the Yucatan Peninsula and entering the eastern borders of his central Mexican empire. Montezuma resided at a distance from the coast in the capital city of Tenochtitlan, which is today Mexico City. A strong ruler who had aggressively expanded the Aztec Empire to its height, Montezuma weighed his options concerning this new expedition before deciding whether to welcome its leader, Hernando Cortés.</p>

<p id="auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_fs-idm281076704">Montezuma led an empire that served its patron <span data-type="term">deity</span> through the capture and sacrifice of war captives. He was no stranger to warfare and certainly was not intimidated by Cortés and his Spanish companions. Like other Native Americans, Montezuma viewed the bearded white Spaniards with curiosity, yet he understood that they were just as mortal as he was, and certainly not gods. That said, he faced not only Cortés and his few hundred Spaniards but also thousands of Spain’s Native American allies, many from Montezuma’s unbeatable military rival and neighbor, Tlaxcala. Montezuma thus knew the Spaniards could successfully defend themselves in battle. Not only did their steel swords hold a decisive advantage over the <span data-type="term">obsidian</span> axes and clubs used by the Native Americans of central Mexico but the Spaniards could also garner support from towns at odds with the Aztecs, which might supply them with food and warriors.</p>

<p id="auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_fs-idm259512064">Like many empires, the Aztec culture conquered its neighbors with military might and forced them to pay tribute in labor and goods. Even the capital, Tenochtitlan, was held together by political and military persuasion, which allowed tensions to simmer under the surface. For example, although the city of Tlatelolco was incorporated into Tenochtitlan as a sister city in the fifteenth century, it had been at odds with Tenochtitlan and its rulers long before the Spaniards arrived (its inhabitants later blamed Montezuma for the Aztecs’ defeat). Such division provided Cortés with a ready supply of allies willing to throw off the yoke of Aztec oppression.</p>

<p id="auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_fs-idm260368672">Montezuma also considered his duty to his people. When faced with the decision of what to do about Cortés, he could jump headfirst into war, certainly. But a lengthy war could affect the planting and harvesting season, which would mean famine for his subjects. So he chose a more pragmatic approach: Montezuma would welcome and entertain the foreigner, impress him with the greatness of the vast capital city, and persuade him to be an ally. If all else failed, Montezuma always had the option of war. For the sake of his people and empire, however, a negotiation with Cortés made much more sense.</p>

<p id="auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_fs-idm269661904">Montezuma’s decision to welcome Cortés into his city reflected his strength and intelligence, not his weakness. Years of reports of Spaniards along the coastline suggested they were in the Americas to stay. Even defeating Cortés outright would only delay the inevitable negotiations that must be made with the newcomers. Montezuma rightly concluded that it was better to negotiate with the Spaniards on his terms, in his city, from a position of strength. After all, Cortés had already shown himself willing to ally with other Native American cities. Surely Montezuma could convince him that he would be the most valuable ally of all and negotiate a deal that would allow him to keep his empire intact and his people safe.</p>

<p id="auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_fs-idm273807968">Thus Montezuma welcomed and entertained the Spaniards for a few months (<a href="#auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_BRI_APUSH01_04_CortMont" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). He showed them his temples, the enormous markets where goods from all over his empire were sold, his zoo, and his palaces. Montezuma did not think Cortés was the <span data-type="term">reincarnation</span> of an ancient Aztec deity, as some thought at the time. He was just a powerful rival who could be bent to Montezuma’s will and interests.</p>

<p id="auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_fs-idm269575440">Some Native Americans from Tlateloloco later encouraged the belief that omens predicting the destruction of his empire, including an eclipse, a comet, and a terrible storm, had frightened Montezuma (<a href="#auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_BRI_APUSH01_04_MontComet" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Yet this was an attempt to show Montezuma as a weak, indecisive, and superstitious leader who was to blame for the fall of Tenochtitlan. Instead, he was strong and decisive, and he knew what he wanted from the Spanish.</p>

<p id="auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_fs-idm275306176">For his part, during his stay in Tenochtitlan, Cortés took every opportunity to search for precious metals and convert Montezuma to Christianity. Montezuma also informed Cortés of his people’s worldview and deities, their traditions, and customs. As a good host, he tolerated some of Cortés’s requests and even offered one of his daughters to Cortés as a potential wife, in the time-honored fashion of Aztecs building alliances. Yet with his emphasis on precious metals and his foreign religion, Cortés began to wear out his welcome.</p>

<p id="auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_fs-idm255325440">Then news from Montezuma’s spies changed everything. In April 1520, they reported that approximately 800 Spaniards had arrived on the coast with 13 ships. Cortés knew at once that the hostile fleet, led by Panfilo de Narvaez, had certainly come from his disgruntled <span data-type="term">patron</span>, Diego de Velázquez. Cortés had betrayed de Velázquez by embarking on this expedition without permission—an act of insubordination for which he could be imprisoned. With a Spanish fleet approaching, however, Montezuma saw his chance to get rid of his increasingly bothersome guest and prepared his people for war. His decision to welcome Cortés had paid off—Montezuma had learned all he could of the interlopers and their intentions and now decided to act.</p>

<p id="auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_fs-idm281544048">Aware of his precarious situation, Cortés moved first by imprisoning Montezuma; the exact details of this event are sparse and contradictory. Leaving a group of men behind to guard the Aztec emperor, Cortés left for the coast in May 1520 to deal with the newcomers. He defeated the Spanish force, the remnants of which decided to join him. In his absence, however, his men had massacred a group of Native Americans gathered to celebrate a religious festival. Relations between the two cultures had reached their low point, and when Cortés returned a month later, the Aztecs began their assault. Desperate and fighting for their lives, the Spaniards fled the city after suffering massive casualties (as did their Native American allies), but they killed Montezuma before they left.</p>

<p id="auto_903db664-cce5-4cf0-aa9e-a8d1232f58dd_fs-idm281449008">Montezuma’s decision to allow Cortés to enter his city cost him his life and ended his empire. It was reasonable for him to assume that the potential benefit of an alliance with the Spaniards was worth the risk, but in the end it was a misjudgment. Montezuma failed to achieve the outcome he desired, because his empire was overwhelmed by a technologically superior foe bent on conquest and wealth.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_bb584da3-7322-4639-b616-73c1f06e4efa_fs-idm257968752"><h3 data-type="title">Claim A</h3>
<p id="auto_bb584da3-7322-4639-b616-73c1f06e4efa_fs-idm249579856">The story of Christopher Columbus and his voyages to the New World is one of cruelty and greed. Departing Spain, Columbus sought a westward route to Asia and the riches it held. His accidental arrival in the Caribbean in 1492 proved frustrating for the explorer, because the islands held none of the spices he desired and only small amounts of gold. Repeated attempts to uncover rich kingdoms in his voyages of 1493, 1498, and 1502 further frustrated the man who became the governor of Hispaniola (today Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Without access to easy riches, Columbus turned to the exploitation and enslavement of the Native Americans.</p>
<p id="auto_bb584da3-7322-4639-b616-73c1f06e4efa_fs-idm261531360">The former settler turned friar, Bartolomé de Las Casas, criticized the actions of Columbus, stating that, in his efforts to please the king, he committed “irreparable crimes against the Indians.” Indeed, Columbus’s crimes against the Native Americans began on his first encounter with the peaceful Arawak. Seeing some of the Arawak with gold ornaments, Columbus took them prisoner and demanded they lead him to the source of the gold. When he returned to Spain from his first voyage, he brought with him some captured Native Americans to show the king. His subsequent expeditions likewise involved the enslavement and mistreatment of Native Americans. During the exploits of Columbus’s second voyage, Michele da Cuneo reported in a letter that Columbus had captured a beautiful Native American woman. Columbus subsequently gave this woman to Da Cueno, and Da Cuneo then proceeded to beat and rape her in the most grotesque manner.</p>
<p id="auto_bb584da3-7322-4639-b616-73c1f06e4efa_fs-idm257583808">Over the years, Columbus sent an estimated several thousand Native Americans to Spain as slaves, with many perishing on the journey. Those Native Americans who did resist succumbed to the Spaniards’ superior steel swords and armor in battle, or were later hanged or burned. The violence perpetrated and allowed by Columbus on Hispaniola coupled with the diseases introduced by the Spanish led to the eventual <span data-type="term">eradication</span> of the Native American population there by the early seventeenth century. In short, Columbus forever poisoned European–Native American relations.</p>
<p id="auto_bb584da3-7322-4639-b616-73c1f06e4efa_fs-idm259265792">Columbus’s mismanagement of Hispaniola and acts of cruelty and torture led to his eventual arrest by colonial administrators and forcible return to Spain. Statements from detractors and supporters of the governor provided lengthy accusations that included his punishing of others, including Spaniards, through the amputation of hands, the nose, tongue, or ears for crimes as petty as slander. His mistreatment and enslavement of the Native Americans was also a common complaint, and even those who supported Columbus admitted things were out of hand. After spending six weeks in jail, he was released and appeared before the Spanish monarchs, who allowed him his freedom and even financed his fourth voyage to the Caribbean. Columbus, however, would never regain his position as governor. Even those who supported and excused his behavior realized the man for what he truly was: a villain.</p>

<p id="auto_bb584da3-7322-4639-b616-73c1f06e4efa_fs-idm256755904">In 1991, on the eve of the celebration marking five hundred years since Columbus discovered the Americas, the City Council of Berkeley, California, voted to replace Columbus Day with <span data-type="term">Indigenous</span> Peoples’ Day. The council adopted the resolution in 1992. In so doing, they joined thousands of others who mistakenly deem Christopher Columbus as a villain whose greed-fueled voyages brought only death and destruction. Indeed, it is not uncommon for critics to use the loaded word “<span data-type="term">genocide</span>” in the same sentence as Columbus. But there is more to the story. The <span data-type="term">vilification</span> of Columbus is not justified.</p>
<p id="auto_bb584da3-7322-4639-b616-73c1f06e4efa_fs-idm255161312">The transatlantic voyage of Christopher Columbus and his subsequent actions continued a pattern of European exploration and expansion established centuries before. Indeed, his most criticized actions—the capture and enslavement of Native Americans; the cutting off of hands, ears, lips, and noses of those deemed insubordinate; and his quest for riches—all had precedent in those who had reconquered Spain or conquered the Atlantic islands. The acts are reprehensible by today’s standards to be sure. Yet they are certainly not unique to Columbus, who simply used practices in most cases considered the status quo by many European and non-European cultures at the time.</p>
<p id="auto_bb584da3-7322-4639-b616-73c1f06e4efa_fs-idm275682000">In fact, an argument can be made that Columbus would prove beneficial to the colonies in the long run. The Americas developed in isolation from Europe for millennia, but that could not last. Eventually, the Americas and its inhabitants would have to find their place in an increasingly interconnected world dominated by a technologically superior Europe. Within this meeting of two worlds, it is true that Native Americans suffered, but most suffered from the unintended consequences of disease. Moreover, many Native Americans benefited. Many of them allied with the Spanish to further their own political and economic ambitions, engaging with the new export colonial economy to make themselves fortunes or using the Spanish to overthrow oppressive Native American overlords such as the Aztecs, ending their practices of human sacrifice and incessant warfare. Given what we know about the violence and warfare of the Aztecs or many other groups of Native Americans, had they possessed the technology to cross the ocean and invade Spain, would they have displayed any more mercy than the Spanish?</p>
<p id="auto_bb584da3-7322-4639-b616-73c1f06e4efa_fs-idm277148672">Columbus and his patron country of Spain recognized the authority of the Native American nobility and, eventually, would allow the sociopolitical structure of many cultures to continue throughout colonial rule. In truth, colonial life for many Native Americans continued many indigenous traditions. Moreover, unlike other European countries, Spain was not so averse to settlers having sexual relations with Native Americans and even encouraged Spaniards to marry into the indigenous nobility. Particularly when compared with Native Americans living outside Spanish America, those in Spanish America fared much better and continued and preserved much of their culture, a culture that survives today intertwined with that of Spain throughout the Americas. Seen in this light, Columbus and his introduction of Spanish culture to the Americas benefited the Native American population in the long term by allowing them to maintain much of their culture and traditional ways of life in ways unmatched throughout the Americas today, as they transitioned into an increasingly interconnected world.</p>

<p id="auto_d66e400f-19f6-49bf-83c7-8cde2a9d8f3a_fs-idm234818848">Christopher Columbus made landfall on an island in what is now the Bahamas on October 12, 1492, after setting sail from Spain about two months earlier. He continued to explore the Caribbean, conquering the lands in the name of God, Spain, and his benefactors, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. Through his journeys, the Italian explorer encountered new cultures, flora and fauna, and enormous economic potential in the “New World.” Noting that inhabitants of the island wore gold jewelry, Columbus and his men set out to find gold deposits on the island. By the early sixteenth century, the Spanish had exhausted most of the gold deposits accessible through mining methods of that time, and the native Taino people were decimated by disease, forced labor, and murder.</p>
<p id="auto_d66e400f-19f6-49bf-83c7-8cde2a9d8f3a_fs-idm236788432">The following primary source is a letter written by Christopher Columbus to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, in which he advised that the Spanish Crown capitalize on the newfound lands by creating colonies and setting up structures for governance, focusing on the island of Hispaniola (Espanola), which is today Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</p>

<p id="auto_94c2ed58-86ee-44f2-9500-bca29a9c2c14_fs-idm275757408">Hernán Cortés arrived in what is now Mexico in 1519. He was sent by the Spanish king Charles V to explore more of the Caribbean territories, search for gold and other resources, and claim this land in the name of the king. In 1520, he and approximately three hundred men traveled to the interior of Mexico to the mighty Aztec Empire, which was ruled by King Montezuma II. Eventually, he was brought to the capital of this empire, Tenochtitlan, which is today known as Mexico City. This city was home to approximately twenty million people. By 1521, however, Cortés and his three hundred men managed to bring this great city under Spanish control. Cortés documented his two years in Mexico to his benefactor, King Charles V, in a series of letters.</p>

<p id="auto_c0eba990-597b-455d-b7d8-36ee5dbd2af9_fs-idm277032400">Bartolomé de Las Casas was a Dominican priest who was one of the first Spanish settlers in the New World. After participating in the conquest of Cuba, Las Casas freed his own slaves and spoke out against Spanish cruelties and injustices in the empire. He argued for the equal humanity and natural rights of the Native Americans. Las Casas worked for the conversion of Native Americans to Christianity and for their better treatment. Pope Paul III agreed and issued an edict in 1537 banning the enslavement of Native Americans. The Spanish crown also agreed and banned in the 1542 New Laws the enslavement of Native American. In 1550, the crown abolished the <em data-effect="italics">encomienda</em> system, which allowed the Spanish to seize Native Americans’ lands and force their labor. In 1552, Las Casas published a shocking account of Spanish cruelties, <em data-effect="italics">A Very Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies</em>. He blamed the depopulation of the Native American populations on Spanish brutality rather than on the spread of disease. This gave rise to the Black Legend, a legend that Protestant nations such as England and the Netherlands used as propaganda to denounce the imperial system of Catholic Spain and promote their own means of settlement, which they viewed as more peaceful and benevolent.</p>

It should be kept in mind that their insatiable greed and ambition, the greatest ever seen in the world, is the cause of their villainies. And also, those lands are so rich and <strong data-effect="bold">felicitous</strong>, the native peoples so meek and patient, so easy to subject, that our Spaniards have no more consideration for them than beasts. And I say this from my own knowledge of the acts I witnessed. But I should not say "than beasts" for, thanks be to God, they have treated beasts with some respect; I should say instead like excrement on the public squares. And thus they have deprived the Indians of their lives and souls, for the millions I mentioned have died without the Faith and without the benefit of the sacraments. This is a wellknown and proven fact which even the tyrant Governors, themselves killers, know and admit. And never have the Indians in all the Indies committed any act against the Spanish Christians, until those Christians have first and many times committed countless cruel aggressions against them or against neighboring nations. <a href="#auto_c0eba990-597b-455d-b7d8-36ee5dbd2af9_fs-idm352898096">For in the beginning the Indians regarded the Spaniards as angels from Heaven. Only after the Spaniards had used violence against them, killing,</a> robbing, torturing, did the Indians ever rise up against them.</p>

<p id="auto_ea9322da-3b23-4015-8914-a40affcae6d0_fs-idm257131392">European explorers unwittingly brought diseases with them as they made contact with the residents of the New World. These invisible microbes had devastating and profound consequences: Native Americans had never been exposed to diseases such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and typhoid, and therefore had no immunities. These diseases wreaked havoc on the Native American societies, wholly destroying some groups and severely weakening others. The following image (<a href="#auto_ea9322da-3b23-4015-8914-a40affcae6d0_BRI_APUSH_01_06_Codex" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) comes from <em data-effect="italics">The Florentine Codex</em>, a compilation of materials and information on Aztec history organized by Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún and his students. The friar spent over fifty years studying Aztec culture and history, working on the Codex from 1545 until his death in 1590. The Codex consists of more than twenty-four hundred pages, with images drawn by Native American artists. The accompanying text was written in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec people.</p>

They could no longer walk about, but lay in their dwellings and sleeping places, no longer able to move or stir.

The pustules that covered people caused great desolation; very many people died of them, and many just starved to death; starvation reigned, and no one took care of others any longer. On some people, the pustules appeared only far apart, and they did not suffer greatly, nor did many of them die of it. But many people's faces were spoiled by it, their faces were made rough.

<p id="auto_82843ba7-7e43-4e60-a70c-201513216f66_fs-idm224585216">This primary source is an example of an oral tradition, which is defined for students in the introduction to the document. Because there are very few accounts from a Native American perspective prior to European contact, oral traditions can provide an important piece of the puzzle in understanding the past, because they express how a people see themselves. At the same time, oral traditions can be complicated because of the issue of translation and the lack of cultural context. After completing the historical reasoning questions for this source, lead students in a discussion of the importance of considering point of view, purpose, audience, and limitations for any source in history, not merely oral traditions, because approaching sources critically is an important skill for the AP Exam and the study of history in general.</p>
<p id="auto_82843ba7-7e43-4e60-a70c-201513216f66_fs-idm226338048">It can be helpful for context to allow students the opportunity to look at the websites for the six nations that constitute the Iroquois Confederacy today, if time permits.</p>

<p id="auto_82843ba7-7e43-4e60-a70c-201513216f66_fs-idm234828848">Very few written sources exist from the perspective of any North American Indians before European contact. This poses a huge challenge to scholars wishing to learn about the enormous economic, political, and cultural diversity of these groups before the arrival of Europeans. Historians are left with the archeological record, European accounts of first encounters, and Native American oral traditions. Oral traditions consist of stories handed down through generations, yet our records of these traditions were often compiled after European contact.</p>
<p id="auto_82843ba7-7e43-4e60-a70c-201513216f66_fs-idm225158640">The Iroquois Confederacy was centered in what is today upstate New York and was one of two large chiefdoms that existed when English colonists arrived on the eastern seaboard (the other being the Powhatan Confederacy in eastern Virginia). The following source recounts the foundation of the Iroquois Confederacy, or Haudenosaunee, as the member nations refer to themselves. The confederacy is believed to date from c. 1570–1600; this version of its creation was first published in 1881 by a Tuscarora chief, Elias Johnson, in a work entitled “Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations and History of the Tuscarora Indians.”</p>

<p id="auto_82843ba7-7e43-4e60-a70c-201513216f66_fs-idm230581920">“The Histories which are in the schools, and from which the first impressions are obtained, are still very deficient in what they relate of Indian History, and most of them are still filling the minds of children and youth, with imperfect ideas. I have read many of the Histories, and have longed to see refuted the slanders, and blot out the dark pictures which the historians have wont to spread abroad concerning us. May I live to see the day when it may be done, for most deeply have I learned to blush for my people.</p>
<p id="auto_82843ba7-7e43-4e60-a70c-201513216f66_fs-idm239016656">I thought, at first, of only giving a series of Indian Biographies, but without some knowledge of the government and religion of the Iroquois, the character of the Indians could not be understood or appreciated.</p>
<p id="auto_82843ba7-7e43-4e60-a70c-201513216f66_fs-idm234645008">I enter upon the task with much distrust. It is a difficult task at all times to speak and to write in foreign language, and I fear I shall not succeed to the satisfaction of myself, or to my readers.”</p>

<p id="auto_517190c2-a449-408d-9827-00240e970e34_fs-idm257430128">Tales of Spanish riches in the New World quickly spread throughout Europe. With the support of Queen Elizabeth I, English adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh wanted to establish a permanent North American settlement as a harbor for English privateers to prey upon Spanish galleons hauling riches back to Spain. Raleigh also hoped to discover gold and silver in his own right, to find a water passage through the New World on to the riches of India and China, and to Christianize the Native Americans. Raleigh sponsored several voyages to achieve this goal. John White was an English artist who accompanied one of these expeditions looking for a place to establish Raleigh’s colony. White’s voyage took him to Roanoke Island in present-day North Carolina in 1585. The group failed to establish a colony, but White produced many watercolor portraits of the Algonquian Indians he encountered during the year-long expedition. Two years later, Raleigh again attempted to establish a settlement at Roanoke Island. Raleigh’s colony had disappeared by 1590 and came to be known as the Lost Colony.</p>

<p id="auto_3e3e06d7-8e72-4538-83c4-c05648202f5e_fs-idm256755904">1. Students should answer the following question on <strong data-effect="bold">Handout A: QFT Notes and Reflections</strong> individually: How do historians use questions?</p>
<p id="auto_3e3e06d7-8e72-4538-83c4-c05648202f5e_fs-idm260606480">2. Ask students to volunteer their responses in a whole-group discussion. Students should understand that historians use questions to drive their inquiry or research into particular topics or arguments and can question historical events, peoples’ actions, and/or the effect of these experiences. Students can be asked follow-up questions such as:</p>

<p id="auto_3e3e06d7-8e72-4538-83c4-c05648202f5e_fs-idm264563920">1. Students will participate in an exercise known as the Question Formulation Technique, or the QFT<sup>®</sup>. The QFT is designed to encourage students to ask their own questions, pique their interest in a subject, and build confidence in their historical thinking skills. Explain to students that they will be using the QFT today, which means they will be formulating questions on the basis of a prompt that will appear on the next slide, known as the QFocus. Have students read the four rules to the QFT aloud, which should be posted on the board:</p>
<ul id="auto_3e3e06d7-8e72-4538-83c4-c05648202f5e_fs-idm254685424">
<li>Ask as many questions as you can.</li>
<li>Do not stop to answer, judge, or discuss any questions.</li>
<li>Change any statement into a question.</li>
<li>Write down every question exactly as stated.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_3e3e06d7-8e72-4538-83c4-c05648202f5e_fs-idm261371952">Explain to students that these are the only rules they must follow in this process. Engage students in a discussion about these rules:</p>
<ul id="auto_3e3e06d7-8e72-4538-83c4-c05648202f5e_fs-idm259637184">
<li>What are you going to be doing during this activity?</li>
<li>What will be challenging about following these rules?</li>
<li>Which rule will be most difficult to follow?</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_3e3e06d7-8e72-4538-83c4-c05648202f5e_fs-idm259998752">2. When students are clear on the directions, divide students into groups of two or three and assign each group to a piece of chart paper. The group should nominate a recorder to record questions from all group members. When all groups are ready, show the QFocus: the map of pre-Columbian Native American settlement and the map of British, French, and Spanish colonies in 1750.</p>
<p id="auto_3e3e06d7-8e72-4538-83c4-c05648202f5e_fs-idm237790560">3. Allow students to ask questions for about 15 minutes without interruption. If students seem to be slowing down or checking out of the activity, remind students of the rules or ask them to repeat a certain rule (i.e., if they make an observation to a peer instead of asking a question, ask the student to read rule 3: “Change any statement into a question.”). Monitor students; when most groups have a full piece of chart paper, give students a one-minute warning.</p>

<p id="auto_3e3e06d7-8e72-4538-83c4-c05648202f5e_fs-idm268342992">1. Ask students to step back from their poster and read over the questions they generated as a group. Students should label their closed- and open-ended questions with a “c” or “o.”</p>
<ul id="auto_3e3e06d7-8e72-4538-83c4-c05648202f5e_fs-idm257583808">
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Closed-ended</strong> questions have one specific answer (i.e., “What year did the British come to North America?”)</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Open-ended</strong> questions have many answers or require a lengthy response (i.e., “Why did the British come to North America?”)</li>

<p id="auto_d05714eb-b19a-48f5-9a6c-222f417a19a2_fs-idm259661456">1. Task each group with identifying the top three tools or technologies that affect society today (students may suggest computers, modern medicine, cell phones, and so forth). As each group shares, compile a class list. Once all groups have shared, ask the students to come to a consensus on the defining technology of our era, based on their list.</p>
<p id="auto_d05714eb-b19a-48f5-9a6c-222f417a19a2_fs-idm260631952">2. Transition to the past by informing students that the creation of colonies in the New World took place during the Age of Sail. Facilitate a brief discussion on the role of ships and the importance of sailing technology by asking questions such as:</p>
<ol id="auto_d05714eb-b19a-48f5-9a6c-222f417a19a2_fs-idm237678448" type="a">
<li>Why would this era be known as the “Age of Sail”?</li>
<li>Can you make any comparisons between defining the present by (chosen technology) and defining this period by sailing ships? (Does it make people’s lives easier? Better? More exciting? And so forth.)</li>
<li>What limitations did ships have during the “Age of Sail”?</li>
<li>How long do you think transatlantic journeys took during this period?</li>
<li>How do you think this distance affected the colonies?</li>

<p id="auto_d05714eb-b19a-48f5-9a6c-222f417a19a2_fs-idm278500928">1. Give each group a copy of <strong data-effect="bold">Handout B: Key Terms of the Age of Sail.</strong> Have your students separate the key terms and match them with the images they think appropriate. Once identified, they should also put the ship images in chronological order.</p><p id="auto_d05714eb-b19a-48f5-9a6c-222f417a19a2_fs-idm259059088">2. Once the ships are ordered, have students identify how the ship designs advanced over time, why they think each of these technological advancements was significant, and how these advancements would have affected the lives of the men and women of this period. The following questions are samples that can guide their examination:</p>
<ul id="auto_d05714eb-b19a-48f5-9a6c-222f417a19a2_fs-idm259736672">
<li>What are the limitations or advantages of this ship type?</li>

<p id="auto_d05714eb-b19a-48f5-9a6c-222f417a19a2_fs-idm273514400">Once the groups have matched all their terms, organized the images, and stated their significance, the groups should prepare a thesis statement in response to the following prompt. Students should cite evidence from this activity in defense of their thesis statement.</p>

<p id="auto_d05714eb-b19a-48f5-9a6c-222f417a19a2_fs-idm257484080">Have the class write their thesis statements on the board. Discuss these statements, helping students strengthen and clarify them. Probe their responses and ensure they use evidence in defense of their statements. Ask them to identify what additional information would have been helpful.</p>
<p id="auto_d05714eb-b19a-48f5-9a6c-222f417a19a2_fs-idm280507936">Finally, review the steps the students just went through. Highlight that there was a gathering of evidence in matching terms, an analysis of this evidence in organizing the images, an interpretation of the evidence in writing their thesis statements, and argumentation in using evidence to defend their thesis. These steps are central to the historian’s craft.</p>

<li>Write a letter to parliament as the king or queen of England justifying the expense of these voyages and your hopes for their return. Convince parliament to support your decision to send or perhaps continue to send voyages to the New World.</li>
<li>In your memoirs, as the king or queen of England, you are reflecting on your decision to spend great amounts of money and risk dangerous seas and pirates for what you got in return.

<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm539457440">A Paideia Seminar is similar to a Socratic seminar but is intended to interrogate a single text or a pair of texts. The purpose of this activity is to allow students to discuss their understanding freely and openly in an academic fashion, and to collectively build understanding of a topic.</p>
<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm232617840">For this activity, students should be arranged in a circle or a square so that all students can see and hear each other without obstructions. If necessary, students can be arranged in a “fishbowl,” with half the students on the outside circle, who will not speak in the first half of discussion, and the other half on the inside, who will be the main participants in the first half of discussion. Students can then be paired to observe and record a partner’s participation in the discussion and then switch halfway through the questions.</p>
<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm246315728">To cultivate civil discourse, it is important that the teacher and students respect the good will of others, regardless of their views and opinions. The teacher should only interject to correct a misconception or understanding, to redirect or refocus the conversation back to the question, or to present a new question to the group. Not all questions need to be asked for the seminar to be successful; the questions asked are up to the teacher’s (and potentially students’) discretion.</p>
<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm230241200">The teacher should also keep track of student participation in the discussion using <strong data-effect="bold">Handout D: Paideia Seminar Rubric</strong> and ideally provide this specific feedback to students with specific goals for developing their civil discourse skills in speaking and listening. Because this material is presented near the beginning of the course, this activity can be greatly beneficial to building classroom culture. If students are at first uncomfortable with free discussion, they can be provided with <strong data-effect="bold">Handout F: Discussion Starters</strong>.</p>

<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm237247696">1. Before this lesson, students should be introduced to the concept of a Paideia Seminar and the purpose of the activity.</p>
<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm233764352">2. Students should make a name tent for themselves by folding the piece of paper and writing their name on it with a marker.</p>
<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm226468976">3. Students will use <strong data-effect="bold">Handout A: Paideia Seminar Goals and Notes</strong> to write down one individual goal for themselves. Because this is most likely the first time students have participated in a Paideia Seminar as a group, students may need assistance in developing goals for themselves for this activity (see <strong data-effect="bold">Handout E: Individual Goal Bank</strong>). It may be helpful to distribute a few copies of these sentence starters to students to assist in their goal creation.</p>
<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm233721056">4. Ask one or two students to share their individual goal, if they wish.</p>
<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm237235712">5. Remind students of the purpose of the day’s activity. Then ask students to brainstorm some class norms to which all can adhere during the discussion. These norms may include:</p>
<ul id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm233747792">
<li>Respect others and other opinions.</li>
<li>Criticize ideas, not people.</li>
<li>One mic means one voice (or, take turns speaking).</li>
<li>Be aware of others trying to speak.</li>
<li>Don’t interrupt.</li>
<li>Ask questions when you don’t understand.</li>
<li>Speak loudly, clearly, and in a respectful tone.</li>
<li>Sit up and practice active listening skills.</li>
<li>Take notes on important points.</li>
<li>Use the text to support your answer.</li>
<li>Be patient and allow others to speak their minds; practice wait time between responses before speaking.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm234937984">6. Then, ask students to suggest goals for the class to strive toward. These goals should be concrete, measurable, and something that everyone contributes to and can attain. These goals may include:</p>
<ul id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm224185088">
<li>Everyone should speak at least once.</li>
<li>Everyone should ask at least one question.</li>
<li>Everyone should use the text each time they speak.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm237129552">7. The class should be in consensus about their class goals and state them succinctly. Once a consensus has been reached, a volunteer should post the goals on the board so they are visible throughout the activity, and students should write down these goals on <strong data-effect="bold">Handout A: Paideia Seminar Goals and Notes.</strong></p>

<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm223626992">1. The teacher should be seated in the circle along with students. Remind students of the goals of the activity, and set the tone:</p>

<li>A Paideia Seminar is a collaborative, intellectual dialogue about a text, facilitated with open-ended questions. The main purpose of this particular seminar is to arrive at a fuller understanding of the ideas and values in Christopher Columbus’s voyage to the Americas, of ourselves, and of each other.</li>
<li>As the facilitator, I am primarily responsible for asking challenging, open-ended questions. I will take a variety of notes to keep up with the discussion, and I will help move the discussion along by asking follow-up questions.</li>
<li>As participants, I am asking you to think, listen, and speak candidly about your thoughts, reactions, and ideas. You can help each other do this by using each other’s names and referencing each other’s comments. It is not necessary that you raise your hands during the discussion; rather, the discussion is collaborative in that you try to stay focused on the main speaker and take turns sharing your ideas. Be sure to take notes on our discussion so you can remember your ideas and conclusions later.</li>
<li>Are there any questions about how this is going to work or what your responsibilities are as participants?</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm222894592">2. Begin the discussion with the Round Robin question on <strong data-effect="bold">Handout B: Paideia Seminar Questions</strong>. This should be answered in a single word or phrase, and students should not elaborate until all have shared. This does not count toward students’ participation.</p>
<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm228813072">3. Continue the discussion by opening up the floor for elaboration on the Round Robin question.

<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm246213104">1. Continue the discussion using questions from the “Elaborate and Apply” section on <strong data-effect="bold">Handout B: Paideia Seminar Questions</strong>. If you are using the fishbowl method, ensure that students in the first and second half of the discussion have the opportunity to answer “Explore” and “Elaborate and Apply” questions during their time.</p>
<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm227798912">2. End with the Closing Round Robin question for both groups: “Should Christopher Columbus have his own national holiday in the United States? Why or why not?” Students should first all share their “yes” or “no” response, and if time allows, they can elaborate on their answer.</p>

<p id="auto_3b93c8f7-3642-4dcd-95c7-f7437f7374f0_fs-idm221022112">1. After the discussion, students should complete <strong data-effect="bold">Handout C: Paideia Seminar Reflection</strong>. If time allows, students may reflect as a group on the experience of the Paideia Seminar format and how well they think they did as individuals and as a class.

<li>Students will use <strong data-effect="bold">Handout A: Long Essay Rubric</strong> and read through the rubric.

<li>Students will share their responses with others until they have found a partner whose self-identified strength matches their weakness, or vice versa.</li>
<li>After students have found a partner, the teacher will lead a discussion on strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing that it’s important to recognize the skills students already have. Students should then set a goal for writing this Long Essay, responding to where they feel least confident or another area of the rubric that they want to focus on.</li>

<li>Students should share their work with their partner from the warm-up by exchanging written outlines and reading their partner’s. At this time, students should not discuss or clarify their essay; rather, they should allow their partner to provide them with feedback on <strong data-effect="bold">Handout C: Peer Feedback</strong> using the following Praise, Polish, and Pose method:
<ol id="auto_ddcca5c9-c672-4c1e-bfdb-3ca36461c7e0_fs-idm259955552" type="a">
<li>Praise: Offer at least one piece of positive feedback. What was done well?</li>
<li>Polish: Offer at least one piece of constructive feedback. How can the essay be improved?</li>
<li>Pose: Ask your partner a clarifying or probing question. What are you confused by, or what do you want to know more about?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Next, students should discuss their Praise, Polish, and Pose feedback with their partner in a “mini conference.” Students should focus on each essay one at a time, spending approximately three minutes per outline. Students should have the opportunity to respond to their partner’s feedback or record any information necessary to improve their work.</li>
<li>Students will then create an action plan for their individual outline, noting two or three specific steps they will take to improve it, on the basis of their peer’s feedback and the AP Rubric.</li>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm266366032">The sixteenth century brought changes in Europe that helped reshape the whole Atlantic world of Europe, Africa, and the Americas. These events were the rise of nation states, the splintering of the Christian church into Catholic and Protestant sects, and a fierce competition for global commerce (<a href="#auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_BRI_APUSH_02_02_Timeline1" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Spain aggressively protected its North American territorial claims against imperial rivals, for example. When French Protestant <span data-type="term">Huguenots</span> established Fort Caroline (Jacksonville, Florida, today) in 1564, Spain attacked and killed the settlers the following year. France, Britain, and Holland wanted their own American colonies, and privateers from these countries used safe havens along the coast of North America to raid Spanish treasure ships. But North America did not hold the gold and silver found in Spanish possessions in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Peru. In the end, Spain concentrated on these more profitable portions of its empire, and other European nation states began to establish their own claims in North America.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm273228880">Europe’s political, religious, and economic rivalries were fought in both European wars and in a struggle for colonies throughout the Atlantic. England’s Queen Elizabeth I supported Protestant revolts in Catholic France and the Spanish Netherlands, which put her at odds with Spain’s Catholic monarch, Philip II. So did her support for English privateers such as Sir Frances Drake, Sir George Summers, and Captain Christopher Newport, who preyed on Spanish treasure ships and commerce. In 1584, Elizabeth ignored the Spanish claim to all of North America and issued a royal charter to Sir Walter Raleigh, encouraging him and a group of investors to explore, colonize, and rule the continent.</p>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm273326288">By 1600, the stage had been set for competition between the European nations colonizing the Americas, and several quickly established footholds. The Spanish founded St. Augustine (in what is now Florida) in 1565. In 1607, English adventurers arrived at Jamestown in the Virginia colony (see <a href="#page_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb" class="target-chapter">The English Come to America</a> Narrative). The French established Quebec in what today is Canada, in 1608. Spanish Santa Fe (in what is now New Mexico) was founded in 1610. The Dutch established Albany (now the capital of New York) as a trading center on the Hudson River in 1614, and New Amsterdam (called New York City today) in 1624. English <span data-type="term">Separatists</span>, now known as Pilgrims, established Plymouth Colony in 1620. Ten years later, in 1630, Puritans established the Massachusetts Bay Colony. European settlement grew exponentially. Seventeenth-century North America became a place where diverse nations—European and Native American—came into close contact.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm267371472">By the 1650s, the English, French, and Dutch were well established in North America. French traders used the waterways to move ever deeper into the interior of the continent from their <span data-type="term">toehold</span> in Quebec, trading with American Indians (<a href="#auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_BRI_APUSH_02_02_ColonyMap" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). French <span data-type="term">Jesuit</span> priests lived peacefully with American Indians, learned their languages, recorded their society norms and customs, and worked to convert them to Christianity. Europeans traded imported goods to American Indians for beaver and other furs that brought high profits in Europe (see <a href="#page_8b4a73ad-4dc5-446c-8a9c-3e37b60fe879" class="target-chapter">The Fur Trade</a> Narrative). The American Indians’ economy and culture, and relationships with other native tribes, were changed by their new focus on the fur trade and by the metal tools and firearms the Europeans offered. By the mid-1700s, the French had claimed the St. Lawrence River Valley, the Great Lakes region, and the whole of the Mississippi River Valley.</p>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm272421568">The Dutch settled the Hudson River Valley and established New Amsterdam. They began with a fur-trading site established in 1614 near what is today Albany, New York. It grew steadily during the next several decades, and historians estimate that by the 1660s, about nine thousand people inhabited the Dutch colony.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm265596288">Britain’s settlement at Jamestown, Virginia, which started as an entrepreneurial <span data-type="term">joint-stock company</span>, struggled initially. Investors in the Virginia Company of London sent settlers with supplies and instructions to discover profitable commodities for trade. They were also to search for the legendary <span data-type="term">Northwest Passage</span> to Asia and its lucrative trade. Gold, of course, was at the top of the Virginia Company’s list, but precious metals and jewels eluded the settlers. There were a number of schemes for making money, but it was not until 1617, when John Rolfe exported his first four barrels of Orinoco tobacco—a sweet-scented variety he obtained from the Caribbean and planted in Virginia—that the Virginia economy took off. By 1619, settlers were enjoying private property rights and had elected the House of Burgesses, the first representative assembly in the New World. Tobacco drove the Virginia economy until the twentieth century. A land- and labor-intensive crop, tobacco led the settlers to spread out and establish isolated plantations where indentured servants and later slaves toiled.</p>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm268497520">Native nations in North America sought the advantages of trade and the help of European allies to counter their enemies. But they also strove to control and resist the growing European presence on their land, using both diplomacy and military strikes. During the winter of 1609–1610, for example, Powhatan, an Algonquin chief and the father of Pocahontas, stopped trading with and providing food to the Jamestown settlers. His warriors laid siege to Jamestown and killed all who left the fort. During that winter, described by Englishmen as the “starving time,” Powhatan came close to ending the colony’s existence. Indians again waged war in the Second Anglo-Powhatan War of 1622 and the Third Anglo-Powhatan War of 1644, but by that time, the English presence in Virginia was too strong to resist (see <a href="#page_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab" class="target-chapter">The Anglo-Powhatan War of 1622</a> Narrative).</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm266037744">In the New Amsterdam and New England regions, Dutch and English traders wanted to control the lucrative fur trade. So did American Indian groups. The Pequot began expanding their influence in the 1630s, pushing out the Wampanoag to their north, the Narragansett to the east, and the Algonquians and Mohegan to the west. But they also came into conflict with the English of the Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Connecticut colonies. Tensions came to a head in the Pequot War of 1637, when the Pequots faced an alliance of European colonists and the Narragansett and Mohegan Indians. The conflict ended in disaster for the Pequot: The survivors of the defeated tribe were given to their Narragansett and Mohegan enemies or shipped to the Bahamas and West Indies as slaves.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm268852672">In these and other conflicts, American Indian nations and European nations competed among themselves and with each other for land, trade, and dominance. In the end, however, Europeans kept arriving and growing in numbers. Even more devastating was that American Indians had no immunity to European diseases like measles and smallpox, which caused 90 percent mortality rates in some areas (<a href="#auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_BRI_APUSH_02_02_Smallpox" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Epidemics spread across North America while Europeans steadily pushed American Indians farther west.</p>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm268207040">Enslavement of Africans was introduced early in the settlement of the Americas. In the early 1500s, Spain imported enslaved Africans to the Caribbean to meet the high demand for labor. The Dutch played a key role in the Atlantic slave trade until the 1680s, when the English gained control and allowed colonial shippers to participate. The Atlantic slave trade consisted of transporting captives from the west coast of Africa to the Americas in what became known as the “Middle Passage.” The Middle Passage was one leg of a profitable <span data-type="term">triangular trade</span> in the Atlantic. Ships transported raw materials from the Americas to Europe and then shipped manufactured goods and alcohol to Africa, where they were used to purchase human beings from the West Africans. Ships’ captains packed their human cargo of chained African men, women, and children into the holds of the ships, where roughly 10 to 15 percent died (<a href="#auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_BRI_APUSH_02_02_BrShip" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm275912928">Despite high mortality rates, merchant financiers and slave-ship captains made significant profits. More than ten million Africans were forcibly brought to the Americas during the three-century–long period of the slave trade. Most were destined for Brazil or the West Indies. About 5 percent of the African slave trade went to British North America.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm267831088">The first Africans in British North America arrived at Jamestown aboard a Dutch ship in 1619. Historians are not certain about their initial status—whether they were indentured servants or slaves. What is clear, however, is that over time, a few gained freedom and owned property, including slaves. During the next several decades, laws governing and formalizing the racial and hereditary slave system gradually developed. By the end of the seventeenth century, every colony in North America had a slave code—a set of laws defining the status of enslaved persons.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm276228032">In Maryland and Virginia, enslaved persons provided labor for the tobacco fields (<a href="#auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_BRI_APUSH_02_02_Tobacco" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Farther south, in the Carolinas, indigo and rice were the <span data-type="term">cash crops.</span> A southern plantation system developed that allowed wealthy landowners to manage many slaves who cultivated vast land holdings. Most whites were not large landowners, however. Many small farmers, businessmen, and tradesmen held one or two slaves, while others had none. Some paid a master for a slave’s labor in a system known as hiring out. By 1750, almost 25% of the population in the British colonies was enslaved. In Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina, the percentages were higher than in the North. In those southern colonies, slaves accounted for almost half the population. In South Carolina, almost two-thirds of the population were slaves.</p>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm274718480">No one escaped the brutality of the slave system. Ownership of another human being as chattel property—like a horse or a cow—was often enforced by violence, and violence was always at hand, though masters also provided a variety of incentives such as time off or small gifts at Christmas. Masters and overseers used physical and mental coercion to maintain control. The whip was an ever-present threat and used with horrific results. A master was not faulted or legally punished for killing a rebellious slave. But perhaps one of the most powerful threats was the auction block, where fathers, sons, daughters, and mothers could be sold away from family (<a href="#auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_BRI_APUSH_02_02_Ledger" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The children of enslaved mothers inherited the condition and were born into a life of servitude. Under the law, they were property a master could dispose of as he saw fit.</p>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm273111072">During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, most runaway slaves had no place to go. Before the American Revolution, some southern slaves ran away to Spanish Florida, but every British colony enforced slavery and slave laws, even as a few individuals and groups denounced the brutality of slavery and the slave trade (see the <a href="#page_740a7281-804f-4927-b6d7-7aa6d2fdb6ec" class="target-chapter">Germantown Friends’ Antislavery Petition, 1688</a> Primary Source). People of African descent could be arrested without cause anywhere they were strangers or unknown by the community. Even the few free blacks (probably no more than 0.5 percent of the African American population in 1750) stayed close to communities where they were known, where influential whites vouched for their free status. Law, society, and custom all suppressed the fundamental rights of blacks. This system, enforced by fear and violence, spawned revolts. Some were small; individuals ran away, broke tools, or damaged crops. Other revolts were larger and more violent, like the1739 Stono Rebellion in South Carolina (see <a href="#page_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78" class="target-chapter">The Stono Rebellion</a> Narrative).</p>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm266340976">In 1620, a group of English separatists known as the Pilgrims settled at what today is known as Cape Cod Bay. The Pilgrims were “separatists” because they believed the protestant Church of England remained too close to Catholic doctrine, and they saw no other solution but to leave or separate from the church. Because they dissented from the established state church, they were persecuted, and they decided to leave England (see the <a href="#page_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07" class="target-chapter">Pilgrims to the New World</a> Decision Point). The Pilgrims applied to the Virginia Company of London in 1619 and received a patent to settle at the mouth of the Hudson River. When they reached North America, poor sailing conditions and treacherous waters forced them to settle at Cape Cod Bay instead, where they established the colony they called Plymouth (<a href="#auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_BRI_APUSH_02_02_Landing" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm270066832">In 1628, another group of English religious dissenters arrived in nearby Massachusetts Bay and settled there on behalf of the Massachusetts Bay Company. Like the Pilgrims who settled in Plymouth, these new emigrants believed the Church of England was too Catholic in its practices, but instead of separating, these migrants, known as <span data-type="term">Puritans</span>, sought to purify or reform the Church from within. They hoped to establish a “city upon a hill,” as one of their leaders, John Winthrop, described it—a shining example to their brethren in England of a good and Godly community (see the <a href="#page_02072e90-832f-4aea-908d-cde3bc69a335" class="target-chapter">A City Upon a Hill: Winthrop’s “Modell of Christian Charity,” 1630</a> Primary Source).</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm265522704">Puritans came to America in part for the freedom to practice their religion as they saw fit. Therefore, they enforced a strict religious orthodoxy in Massachusetts and Connecticut. When Roger Williams advocated a separation between church and government and preached freedom of conscience, he was forced to flee Massachusetts. In 1636, he founded Providence, Rhode Island, which became a haven for Protestant religious dissenters. Anne Hutchinson challenged the established Massachusetts Bay clergy on doctrine, an act all the more presumptuous coming from a woman. Banished from the colony, she sought refuge in Rhode Island (see the <a href="#page_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288" class="target-chapter">Anne Hutchinson and Religious Dissent</a> Narrative).</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm272587568">Puritan society was torn in other ways as well. In the 1690s, a group of teenage girls accused members of the community of Salem (today Danvers, Massachusetts) of consorting with the Devil, beginning a period of mass hysteria known as the Salem witch trials, during which several residents were executed. The factors that led to the flurry of accusations were complex and may have included a belief in supernatural forces, England’s control over New England, and economic tensions that made the accusations believable (<a href="#auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_BRI_APUSH_02_02_Spirits" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The hysteria ended only when town leaders themselves were charged with witchcraft and turned against the accusers, leading the newly appointed royal governor to declare the trials over (see <a href="#page_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4" class="target-chapter">The Salem Witch Trials</a> Narrative).</p>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm274863248">Religion was a defining feature of other North American settlements as well (<a href="#auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm268524608" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Cecil Calvert, Lord Baltimore, was an English noble and a Roman Catholic. He received a charter from King Charles I of England allowing him to establish the Maryland proprietary colony and giving him and his family full control of it. Lord Baltimore founded Maryland on religious toleration and provided a safe haven for English Catholics. The first colonists arrived in 1634 and settled at St. Mary’s City. Despite the colony’s 1649 Toleration Act, however, religious tolerance was short lived. In the 1650s, in the wake of the English Civil Wars, a Protestant council ruled the colony and persecuted Roman Catholics (see <a href="#page_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034" class="target-chapter">The Founding of Maryland</a> Narrative).</p>

Quakers were another Protestant group that frequently clashed with the Church of England; Penn had been imprisoned for a time in the Tower of London for his religious views. He saw his proprietorship of Pennsylvania as an opportunity to provide a refuge for Quakers and others persecuted for their beliefs: a “holy experiment” (see the <a href="#page_3cc16652-b7b9-4d1c-8b12-c258fd3c9d06" class="target-chapter">Penn’s Letter Recruiting Colonists, 1683</a> Primary Source). The colony practiced religious toleration, welcoming those of other faiths. Penn pledged to maintain just relations with American Indians and purchased land from the Lenape nation.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm272934896">Penn also intended for the colony to be prosperous, with a diverse population specializing in a wide array of occupations. By the mid-1700s, Philadelphia was one of North America’s most prosperous and rapidly growing trading ports.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm270079584">As colonies prospered and their populations grew, younger generations became increasingly secular, leading to tensions with traditional, established churches. Between the 1730s and 1740s, a wave of religious revivalism known as the Great Awakening swept over the colonies and Europe (see <a href="#page_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b" class="target-chapter">The Great Awakening</a> Narrative). Church services during this revival were characterized by passionate <span data-type="term">evangelicalism</span> meant to evoke an emotional religious conversion. The Great Awakening was opposed to the rationalism of the Enlightenment and questioned traditional religious authority.

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm272722304">In the late 1600s and early 1700s, the British consolidated their control over the eastern seaboard of North America. During the period 1675 to 1676, New England fought against the Wampanoag and their allies in what was called <span data-type="term">King Philip’s War</span>. The conflict resulted in staggeringly high casualties on both sides and the physical expansion of colonies in New England. It helped convince the English government to revoke the Massachusetts charter and establish greater control over the colony (see the <a href="#page_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f" class="target-chapter">King Philip’s War</a> Decision Point and the <a href="#page_50fde56b-cf1e-41d6-94fb-9e26161a90d7" class="target-chapter">Maps Showing the Evolution of Settlement, 1624–1755</a> Primary Source).</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm266269616">Some conflicts arose between the colonists and royal colonial administrations when officials prevented settlers from expanding into American Indians’ lands or failed to protect the settlers when they did. In 1676, western colonists were alarmed by a series of attacks by American Indians, and even more by the perception that Governor William Berkeley’s government in Jamestown was doing little to protect them. Nathaniel Bacon demanded a military commission to campaign against the Indians, but Berkeley refused. The refusal prompted Bacon and his followers—including small planters, indentured servants, and even slaves—to take up arms in defiance of the governor. Ultimately, the rebellion collapsed, and the English crown sent troops to Virginia to reestablish order. White farmers on smaller farms won tax relief and an expanded suffrage. With better economic conditions in England, fewer people migrated as indentured servants, increasing the demand for enslaved people (see the <a href="#page_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f" class="target-chapter">Bacon’s Rebellion</a> Narrative and the <a href="#page_ad80870f-4f75-444e-b3b7-4264a176267e" class="target-chapter">Bacon vs. Berkeley on Bacon’s Rebellion, 1676</a> Primary Source).</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm265999824">European nations sought to control the flow of goods and materials between them and their colonies in a system called <span data-type="term">mercantilism.</span> Mercantilism held that the amount of wealth in the world was fixed and best measured in gold and silver bullion. To gain power, nations had to amass wealth by mining these precious raw materials or maintaining a “favorable” balance of trade. Mercantilist countries established colonies as a source of raw materials and trade to enrich the mother country and as a consumer of manufactures from the mother country. The mercantilist countries established monopolies over that trade and regulated their colonies. For example, the British and colonial trade in raw materials and manufactured goods was expected to travel through British ports on British ships. The result was a closely held and extremely profitable trading network that fueled the British Empire. Parliament passed a series of laws called the Navigation Acts in the middle of the seventeenth century to prevent other nations from benefiting from English imperial trade with its North American colonies.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm267576608">In the mid-1600s, the English went to war with the competing Dutch Empire for control in North America. The English seized New Amsterdam in 1664 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. King Charles II gave it to his brother, the Duke of York, as a proprietorship, and the colony was renamed New York in the Duke’s honor, thus eliminating the Dutch toehold in North America. By the 1700s, therefore, there were only two major European powers in North America: Britain and France.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm267576352">During the early eighteenth century, the French extended their influence from modern-day Canada down the St. Lawrence River Valley through the Great Lakes and into the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. By 1750, French influence extended all the way down the Mississippi to Louisiana (<a href="#auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_BRI_APUSH_02_02_SettleMap1" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Tensions were high as rivalry between France and Great Britain played out against the backdrop of the North American frontier (see the <a href="#page_55d408ee-ebad-4f1e-bb7f-b6f1f257e0dc" class="target-chapter">Albany Plan of Union</a> Narrative).</p>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm274871968">By 1750, both Britain and France claimed the Ohio River Valley. In 1753, the French began building a series of forts there, on land claimed by British land companies such as the Ohio Company and the Loyal Company. Virginia’s lieutenant governor, Robert Dinwiddie, an investor in the Ohio Company, sent a young Virginia militia major named George Washington to the Ohio country to warn the French to leave. They refused.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm274871584">By the spring of 1754, the French were building another fort at the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers (the site of modern-day Pittsburgh). Governor Dinwiddie sent Major Washington back with a contingent of troops. This time, Washington attacked the French and their Indian allies, then moved his force to Fort Necessity. Surrounded there by French, Shawnee, and Delaware fighters, he surrendered after a brief battle on July 4, 1754. This incident sparked the <span data-type="term">Seven Years’ War</span>—or the “<span data-type="term">French and Indian War</span>,” as it was known in America (see the <a href="#page_b588cf6c-ace2-41de-8917-5b28011a2514" class="target-chapter">Washington’s Journal: Expeditions to Disputed Ohio Territory, 1753–1754</a> Primary Source).</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm272474928">The Seven Years’ War was mainly fought in Europe and North America, but engagements also occurred around the world (see the <a href="#page_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd" class="target-chapter">A Clash of Empires: The French and Indian War</a> Narrative). In North America, American Indians continued their complex foreign policy, allying themselves in ways they hoped would allow them to dominate trade in their region. Many tribes sided with the French, but the Iroquois Confederacy and Catawba fought with the British. While British and colonial troops under the command of General Edward Braddock failed to capture Fort Duquesne, other forces moved northward and westward from New York to try to capture key French fortifications.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm270088592">The campaign was a disaster for Britain. But in 1759, the British captured Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain and then defeated the French at Quebec and Fort Niagara. The following year, in Montreal, Governor Vaudreuil negotiated terms with British General Jeffery Amherst and surrendered. In 1763, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Paris, ending the French and Indian War and giving Britain control of all of North America east of the Mississippi River and of Canada. France was expelled from North America, and British colonists celebrated their victory (<a href="#auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_BRI_APUSH_02_02_SYWMaps" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Never did these colonists feel more patriotic toward king and country. One reason was that they expected an opportunity to push farther westward as a result of their success in battle (see the <a href="#page_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b" class="target-chapter">Wolfe at Quebec and the Peace of 1763</a> Narrative).</p>

<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm274733552">That same year, 1763, a coalition of Great Lakes, Illinois region, and Ohio region American Indians went to war against the British. The British emerged victorious, but the Indian nations demonstrated they would not easily submit. Led by an Ottawa man named Pontiac, American Indians warred with British soldiers and colonists across the frontier from Detroit to the Ohio River Valley.</p>
<p id="auto_e1363585-7bd7-4cf5-a3db-50c1647dfac4_fs-idm274732768">The British believed they no longer had to court and negotiate with the American Indians. However, they wanted to end the costly conflicts between the colonists and American Indians. Thus, King George III issued the Proclamation of 1763 and temporarily prohibited settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains. Colonists protested. They believed they had the right to settle those lands. In the meantime, the British had incurred massive debts during the Seven Years’ War and wanted American colonists to pay a share in their protection. Parliament soon passed a series of restrictions and taxes on the colonies without their consent that eventually drove a wedge between them and the mother country.</p>

<p id="auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_fs-idm389487424">The rise of nation-states in Europe and the splintering of the Christian church during the <span data-type="term">Protestant Reformation</span> (begun in 1517) led to political, religious, and economic competition for colonies in North and South America. In the 1500s, Catholic Spain built an extensive empire of its American colonies and grew rich with gold, silver, and precious gems. The Spanish used this bounty to pay for armies to fight their rivals in Europe. The desire for wealth and empire also drove English exploration of North America.</p>

<p id="auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_fs-idm409299632">Tensions between England and Spain increased during the long reign of England’s Protestant Queen Elizabeth I. Following the Gulf Stream currents, Spanish treasure ships traveled up the southern coast of North America on their way back to Europe. The English saw the Chesapeake Bay and eastern coast of what is today North Carolina as strategic locations from which to strike the Spanish ships. Thus, English privateers, along with French and Dutch ships, lay in wait along the coast hoping to capture a rich cargo of gold, silver, and gems destined for Spain. In 1584, Elizabeth I granted a charter to Sir Walter Raleigh (<a href="#auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_BRI_APUSH_02_03_WRaleigh" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) to find riches in the New World and establish a base from which the English could attack and capture Spanish ships.</p>

<p id="auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_fs-idm393966560">Raleigh sent out his first expedition in 1584. Its members built a small fortification on Roanoke Island off what is today the coast of North Carolina, approximately one hundred miles south of the Chesapeake Bay. The adventurers claimed the region for England and named it Virginia in honor of Elizabeth, the virgin queen. In 1587, a group of colonists arrived, led by Governor John White. Shortly after, the governor’s granddaughter, Virginia Dare, became the first English child born in the New World. White departed for England in late 1587 to arrange for provisions for the colony. Unfortunately, he arrived home when England was preparing to meet the <span data-type="term">Spanish Armada</span>, and no ships or supplies could be spared for the American settlers. By the time White returned in the summer of 1590, the colonists had disappeared. All that remained of them was the word “CROATOAN” carved into a post. The sign might have indicated that they had left willingly and possibly incorporated themselves into the Croatoan tribe, but it might also have been meant to tell of an attack in which all the settlers were killed. An approaching storm prevented White from searching for his daughter, granddaughter, and the other colonists. The Lost Colony became one of America’s enduring mysteries (<a href="#auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_BRI_APUSH_02_03_Roanoke" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_fs-idm402048912">In 1606, Elizabeth’s successor, King James I, issued a new charter to a business venture known as the Virginia Company of London. The king granted the company all the territory between modern-day Cape Fear, North Carolina, and Long Island Sound. That grant, of course, ignored the fact that the Indian people the English called Powhatan already ruled much of the Chesapeake region.</p>

<p id="auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_fs-idm398249664">The Virginia Company investors expected to establish a colony that would extract North American riches, including gold, silver, or precious gems. That would be the quickest way to enjoy a return on their investment, but they were open to profit through other natural resources as well. Moreover, they wanted to find the <span data-type="term">Northwest Passage</span>, a legendary waterway to the lucrative Asian trade. The Company was an entrepreneurial enterprise designed to earn a profit, and also a bold and risky venture. By no means was its success guaranteed.</p>

<p id="auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_fs-idm406369312">The Company’s first group of 104 men and boys left London in December 1606 and landed in the Chesapeake Bay in April 1607. The Company had appointed a governing council that selected a president, Captain Edward Maria Wingfield. On May 14, the council chose for its first settlement a location about sixty miles from the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay on the James River, named in honor of the king. Jamestown’s position promised the best defense against England’s greatest enemy, Spain. As it turned out, however, hunger—not the Spanish—would be the settlers’ greatest <span data-type="term">adversary</span>. They arrived at a time of severe drought and, because they had communal rather than private property, lacked an incentive to plant corn. They were also too taken by the mentality of getting rich quick. Many were sickened by disease and salt poisoning from drinking the brackish water and were physically unable to work. Starvation and disease plagued the colony for years.</p>

<p id="auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_fs-idm386586736">Once they had selected the site for their settlement, the Englishmen began exploring the area. On May 26, nearly 200 local Indians attacked them, wounding almost a dozen and killing two Englishmen. As the Indians persisted in attacking the settlement, the settlers began constructing a three-sided fort with bulwarks in each corner to mount cannon. They planted crops, even though it was late in the planting season, but life in the colony remained difficult. In addition to disease and the lack of food, there was political infighting among the councilmen. By the time supply ships arrived from England in January 1608, two-thirds of the colonists were dead.</p>

<p id="auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_fs-idm386620928">Captain John Smith was a controversial figure among the first settlers. He arrived in Virginia in chains, having been accused of mutiny during the voyage from England. In the months after the settlement was established, he undoubtedly contributed to the political infighting on the council. But he also demonstrated his usefulness to the colony, leading expeditions to map the area and obtaining food from local people through a combination of force and trade. In December 1607, while exploring the Chickahominy River area, Smith was captured by the brother of the Powhatan leader. He was taken to the northern shore of what is today called the York River to meet Chief Powhatan.</p>

<p id="auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_fs-idm389637344">Powhatan was a powerful ruler who controlled most of the tribes in the Chesapeake region. John Smith described him as “a tall well proportioned man . . . his head somwhat gray. . . . His age neare 60; of a very able and hardybody to endure any labour.” Smith was fed and questioned during his stay with Powhatan. He later claimed that Powhatan attempted to execute him but the chief’s young daughter, Pocahontas, saved him. Today, some historians believe Smith misunderstood his ordeal and that, in fact, he underwent an adoption ceremony in which he was ritually killed and resurrected by Pocahontas. It seems that Powhatan had decided Smith and the English settlers were worthy allies. Perhaps he wanted to control trade with Europeans. Perhaps he wanted access to metal tools and weapons. We cannot be certain of his motives, but we can be sure the great chief was no novice at diplomacy (<a href="#auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_BRI_APUSH_02_03_PowhatanVA" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_fs-idm398134320">The next year or so was relatively peaceful. Smith continued to explore and map the region. He also successfully traded with American Indians to increase the English supply of food. In September 1608, the council elected Smith president, and over the following year he focused on stabilizing the colony, instituting a “work or starve policy,” and searching for raw materials to export. The Virginia Company of London was concerned that the struggling colony had yet to make a profit. That same month, Smith was badly injured in an explosion and returned to England.</p>

<p id="auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_fs-idm395270992">The Jamestown colony almost did not survive the next year. Even after the arrival of additional supplies and colonists from England, internal strife, lack of food, and conflict with native people turned the winter of 1609–1610 into the “starving time,” during which the colony dwindled from five hundred inhabitants from waves of settlers to sixty. Only the arrival of supplies and new settlers helped Jamestown continue. The colony still struggled economically, and the London Company investors were running out of patience. There were no precious metals or gems in Virginia. The colonists tried refining pitch and tar from local pine trees, a valuable naval commodity. Glassblowers attempted to use local sand to produce glass products. Then, in 1611, John Rolfe began experimenting with the production of tobacco. Tobacco was an <span data-type="term">indigenous</span> plant, but the strong and harsh local variety proved unsuitable for the new tobacco market developing in Europe. Rolfe brought a variety of tobacco from the Caribbean and successfully cultivated it in Virginia. He shipped his first cargo to England in 1617, and within a couple of years Jamestown had established a profitable <span data-type="term">cash crop</span>. The introduction of private property a few years later gave the settlers an incentive to work hard to keep the profits from the tobacco they raised.</p>

<p id="auto_3c8a5f6b-486a-400a-a5fb-299b952c19bb_fs-idm402091920">More colonists arrived, and slowly the struggling colony took hold. A new charter in 1618 encouraged settlement by offering colonists the opportunity to own land and take a hand in managing the affairs of the colony. The first General Assembly met in Jamestown on July 30, 1619, and consisted of the governor, his council, and twenty-two elected members of the <span data-type="term">House of Burgesses</span>. Representing the English settlements established on the James River, the burgesses composed the first European representative assembly in the New World. Finally, after more than ten years, the Englishmen in the Virginia Colony were building a firm foundation economic opportunity and representative government, based upon the English model on which later generations also came to rely. The profits from tobacco led to a scramble for land and indentured servants as settlers risked the high mortality rate to get rich.</p>

<p id="auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_fs-idm391125824">In 1609, Powhatan, the powerful ruler who controlled most of the tribes in the Chesapeake region, became wary of the English settlers who had built the fort on Jamestown Island. The colony seemed to be growing. Regular supply ships arrived from England, and with each ship came more settlers. During the winter of 1609–1610, Powhatan laid siege to Jamestown. We cannot be certain why. Perhaps he wanted to destroy the colony. Perhaps he only wanted to weaken it significantly. In either case, the Powhatan people refused to trade food with the English, whom they sometimes attacked and killed when the settlers ventured outside the Jamestown fort. The English entered into the period they called the “starving time.” Five hundred strong at the beginning of the siege, by May 1610 they had dwindled to sixty. That winter, they ate all their domestic livestock, as well as rats and snakes, and even resorted to cannibalism to survive. They abandoned the fort in June 1610 to make their way back to England. As they departed down the James River, they met the new governor, Lord De La Warr, and much-needed supply ships. De La Warr ordered them to return to Jamestown.</p>

<p id="auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_fs-idm388665968">Tensions between the Powhatan and the English did not end, however. Powhatan sustained his attacks on the settlers, and the English retaliated. In August 1610, the English besieged a Powhatan confederation village, cutting down corn fields, burning houses, and killing the queen and all her children. Relationships remained tense. In 1613, Powhatan’s daughter, Pocahontas, was lured aboard an English ship and held hostage at Jamestown. While living there, she converted to Christianity, took the name Rebecca, and married a colonist named John Rolfe (<a href="#auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_BRI_APUSH_02_03_Pocahontas" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Powhatan supported the marriage. For Europeans and American Indians, marriage was a traditional way to cement an alliance between two peoples. Powhatan did, after all, have enemies to his west, and an alliance with the English could help to keep these enemies, the Monacans, at bay. The marriage of Pocahontas and John Rolfe brought a period of relative peace between settlers and the Powhatan people. It concluded the period historians refer to as the First Anglo-Powhatan War, and the English settlement grew.</p>

<p id="auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_fs-idm407924544">In 1615, Pocahontas gave birth to a son. The following year she, John Rolfe, and their son traveled to England. The trip was an opportunity for Rolfe to cement his business connections for the growing tobacco trade. Several Powhatan Indians accompanied them to see England firsthand and report back. Pocahontas did not return to Virginia. She died and was buried at Gravesend, England, in March 1617. John Rolfe returned. So did Tomocomo, Uttamatomakkin, and other members of the Powhatan delegation. Perhaps they understood that the English would continue to come to Virginia in ever-increasing numbers.</p>

<p id="auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_fs-idm404522304">In April 1618, Powhatan died and was replaced by his brother, Opitchapam. Another brother, Opechancanough, served as the chief responsible for diplomacy and the military. The last several years of Powhatan’s life had been relatively peaceful, but Opechancanough was not inclined to tolerate the growing numbers of English settlers. He decided to make clear that the English lived in the Chesapeake region at the pleasure of the Powhatan. Like the many tribes assembled in the Powhatan confederation, they owed <span data-type="term">fealty</span> to Opitchapam. Over the next two years, Opechancanough carefully planned a strategy to subjugate the English, who were growing in number and expanding geographically.</p>

<p id="auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_fs-idm389872896">By the 1620s, the series of English settlements, or plantations, along the James River had expanded significantly. Tobacco was a profitable crop, but it required a great deal of land. And it required labor. In 1618, the Virginia Company of London had established the headright system, granting fifty acres of land to anyone who paid for his own or another Englishman’s transport to Virginia. The settlers came to Jamestown mostly as indentured servants, who were bound to work for three to seven years to pay off the cost of their passage. If they survived to the end of their terms, they would usually receive a small bounty and could then buy their own property to farm. The first Africans were probably indentured servants, until racial attitudes hardened and the decreasing migration of indentured servants from England led to the practice of enslaving Africans for life. As the population expanded, so did land ownership. Increasingly, the Powhatan saw their cornfields and landscape give way to English tobacco fields.</p>

<p id="auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_fs-idm385452864">Commerce and exchange had encouraged peace between the two cultures. English settlers, believing they were safe, allowed the Powhatan to come and go openly in the settlements. Then, on March 22, 1622, Opechancanough orchestrated a coordinated attack. In settlements along the James River, Powhatans entered ostensibly as friends. At a prearranged signal, they pulled out weapons and attacked, slaughtering men, women, and children in the fields and homes of several plantations. Jamestown was warned and took steps to defend itself, but nearly everywhere else the attack was devastating. Plantations were destroyed and burned. The Powhatan killed 347 people, or one-third of the English population. This Massacre of 1622 (as the settlers called it) launched what historians call the Second Anglo-Powhatan War (<a href="#auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_BRI_APUSH_02_03_Jamestown" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_fs-idm384652176">Opitchapam and Opechancanough did not press their advantage and continue the attack, leaving some historians to believe that perhaps their purpose was not to eradicate the English presence. Rather, they may have wanted to make clear that the English lived there at their pleasure. Other historians argue that Openchancanough tried to debilitate the English to the point where they would abandon the settlements. The chief predicted, “Before the end of two Moons there should not be an Englishmen in all their Countries.”</p>

<p id="auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_fs-idm387999504">For the English, however, the attack signaled that the American Indians had to be conquered. Hostilities continued, and the English, isolated and struggling to feed and defend themselves, suffered a second starving time during the winter of 1622–1623. In organized campaigns against the Powhatan, the English burned villages, destroyed crops, and killed warriors, women, and children. The Powhatan responded with raids and attacks against English settlers. In May, Captain William Tucker held peace negotiations and concluded by providing a toast that poisoned and sickened more than two hundred Powhatans. Then the English fired on the Indians and killed several.</p>

<p id="auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_fs-idm384659088">The next year, the combatants met in a two-day battle that ended with Indian cornfields destroyed and the Powhatans in retreat. By 1632, the two sides had fought to a draw, and they negotiated a peace. But the balance of power had shifted to the English. More settlers continued to arrive: By the 1640s, there were more than eight thousand. They outnumbered the Powhatan living in the region and continued to expand along the James and York Rivers and up into the middle and northern peninsulas of Virginia. Englishmen had taken land everywhere in the Chesapeake, from the James River to the Potomac River and across the bay to the continent’s eastern shore.</p>

<p id="auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_fs-idm398358032">Opechancanough became paramount chief in 1629. In 1644, he launched another ferocious attack that killed more than 400 English settlers, but by then, that represented only a small fraction of their number. The settlers struck back with equal ferocity. In 1646, they captured Opechancanough at his fort on the Pamunkey River. They brought him to Jamestown in chains and treated him like a curiosity on display. English settlers came to gawk at him. Within two weeks he was murdered by one of his guards. His successor, Necotowance, concluded a peace treaty with English governor William Berkeley. Never again, Necotowance pledged, would the Powhatan “wrong the English in any kind, but they would ever hold love and friendship together.”</p>

<p id="auto_1079d731-8e6c-4001-94ae-73a1e41f62ab_fs-idm390654560">The interactions between the American Indians and English in the first 40 years of Virginia settlement were often turbulent and fraught with violence. Each side struggled to dominate and control the contested lands and their bounty, but in the end, the Powhatan could not counter the constant arrival of new English colonists who spread across the Chesapeake region. The expanding English colony steadily displaced native people and established a pattern that was repeated over the next two centuries.</p>

In this attack 347 of the English of both sexes and all ages were killed. Simply killing our people did not satisfy their inhuman nature, they dragged the dead bodies all over the country, tearing them limb from limb, and carrying the pieces in triumph around. . . .</p>
<p>When the occurrence of this massacre became known in the mother country, the English were ordered to take revenge by destroying with fire and sword everything of the Indians; consequently they . . . destroyed both the houses and crops of the Indians, took Opechankenough [Powhatan] prisoner and shot him on the very place where his house stood before it was burned down. On this spot the English then built a new town. By these means the Indians became very much subdued and lived in constant dread of the English.</p>
<p>The English in the meantime became thereafter more prudent in their dealings with the Indians. Moreover, the King of England sent from his arsenals all sort of weapons and ammunition and ordered his subjects to more and more cultivate the land and bring the Indians into submission.”</p>

<p id="auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_fs-idm410270400">Virginia’s English colonists were nervous. Since founding Jamestown in 1607, they had endured cold winters, starvation, war with Indians, and changes in their colonial charter. Now, in 1634, they had a new concern: English Roman Catholics were about to become their neighbors to the north. Remember that in this time, religion and politics were closely related, and since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, for whom the Virginia colony had been named, England had committed itself to Protestantism. Yet in 1632, King Charles I granted a charter to the second Lord Baltimore, Cecil Calvert, to begin a colony in the Chesapeake, right next to Virginia. Cecil and his father, George, had converted to Roman Catholicism in the 1620s.</p>

<p id="auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_fs-idm401224480">All sorts of fears ran through the Virginians’ minds. What if the Catholics coming to the Calvert’s new colony converted Virginian Protestants to their faith? What if these English Catholics threw off the king’s authority once they were an ocean away? Worst of all, what if they allied with Florida’s Spanish Catholics or Canada’s French Catholics and conquered the entire Atlantic Coast under the banner of Roman Catholicism?</p>

<p id="auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_fs-idm401286192">The Calverts knew these fears could disrupt their plans. In their minds, the colony would be a refuge for English Catholics, who had long been persecuted by their Protestant countrymen. They worried that anti-Catholic anger might keep their colony—named Maryland in honor of King Charles’ wife, Queen Henrietta Maria—from succeeding. In an attempt to address Protestant fears, the Calverts published a paper titled “Objections Answered Touching Maryland.” They insisted that they posed no threat to the Protestant colonies in Virginia and New England. They assured their Protestant countrymen that there was no conspiracy to subvert the English Crown, to ally with the Spanish, or to <span data-type="term">proselytize</span> their Protestant neighbors. All the Maryland colonists wanted, the Calverts explained, was to worship freely as Catholics and live in peace and harmony with their neighbors (<a href="#auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_BRI_APUSH_02_03_CalvertMD" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_fs-idm386490752">As it turned out, Maryland’s founders were in for a disappointment. Relatively few English Catholics made the long trek across the Atlantic. The colony founded to be a refuge for Catholics held greater appeal for Protestant dissenters, such as Quakers and Puritans who disagreed with the Church of England. The Calverts had imagined a Catholic colony but ended up with religious diversity. Maryland’s real problem was figuring out how its religiously diverse people, a mix of England’s religious outsiders and members of the Church of England, could live with each other in harmony and order.</p>

<p id="auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_fs-idm393838880">In 1649, Maryland’s assembly proposed a remedy, passing a landmark bill called the “Act Concerning Religion,” also referred to as the Maryland Toleration Act or the Toleration Act (<a href="#auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_BRI_APUSH_02_03_MDTolerAct" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The act made it illegal for Marylanders to use derogatory religious terms for each other, including “heretic, schismatic, idolater … popish priest, Jesuited papist … or any other name or term in a reproachful manner relating to matters of religion.” More important, the act decreed all Christians free to worship as they wished, so long as they believed in the Trinity (the existence of God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and in the divinity of Jesus Christ. No Christians would be persecuted for their faith, and none could be forced to attend services of or pay tithes to any other denomination. The Act was truly ground breaking. For the first time in English law, all Christians were promised free exercise of religion. If the colonists had embraced the concept, Maryland would have become the first place in the English-speaking world where Catholics, Protestants, and Christians of all kinds could live together in peace.</p>

<p id="auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_fs-idm390238608">Unfortunately for Maryland’s Catholics, events back in England frequently disrupted colonial harmony. King Charles I’s own Catholic leanings, together with his high-handed use of monarchical power, eventually led to the English Civil War (1642–1645). After Charles’s defeat and execution for treason in 1649, England was ruled by the Puritan Oliver Cromwell. Under the authority of the English Parliament, Puritans seized control of Maryland. These new overseers, staunch Reformed Protestants, were not friendly toward Catholicism. They immediately repealed the Toleration Act and banned Catholics from openly worshiping.</p>

<p id="auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_fs-idm389397776">After the English monarchy was restored in 1660 by Charles I’s son, King Charles II, the Toleration Act was reinstated. But tensions between pro-Catholic Englishmen and Reformed Protestants continued. After Charles II’s death in 1685, his brother James II became king. Britain’s Protestants, increasingly nervous at James’s friendliness with France, decided they had had enough of pro-Catholic kings. In 1688, England overthrew James and replaced him with the Dutch Protestant William of Orange, who was married to Mary, the daughter of James. This “<span data-type="term">Glorious Revolution</span>” affirmed the Protestant character of the English monarchy once and for all. It also allowed simmering anti-Catholic sentiment in England and the North American colonies to boil over (<a href="#auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_BRI_APUSH_02_03_CharlesI" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<figure id="auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_BRI_APUSH_02_03_CharlesI" class="full-width"><figcaption>Religion and politics were a deadly mix in England and its colonies in the mid to late seventeenth century. The English Civil War saw the execution of the pro-Catholic Charles I outside Whitehall Palace in London. Religious tensions continued during the reigns of the Puritan leader Oliver Cromwell, Charles II (the son of the beheaded King Charles I), and James II (Charles II’s pro-Catholic brother) until the Glorious Revolution of 1688.</figcaption>

<p id="auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_fs-idm393935936">In Maryland, resentment against Catholic leaders had been growing for decades. Although the majority of the population was Protestant, Catholics retained control of the <span data-type="term">proprietary government</span> and reinstated the Toleration Act. At least according to some Protestants, Maryland’s religious liberty was a farce. Catholics appeared to enjoy all the power and all the wealth. Protestants complained that Catholic officials monopolized political offices, imposed unfair taxes, and lived in luxury while Protestant ministers struggled to make a living. Some non-Catholics whispered that Maryland Catholics had allied with the Seneca Indians for the “total destroying of all the Protestants.”</p>

<p id="auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_fs-idm407333536">When word of James II’s ouster came across the Atlantic, Protestants in Maryland rejoiced, while Catholics continued to hope that James II might still put down the rebellion. Finally, Protestants acted against the Catholic proprietors. John Coode, an Anglican minister and zealous anti-Catholic, led an armed force against the colonial capital, present-day Annapolis. When the Catholic government tried to rally Marylanders to put down Coode’s Rebellion, it found few who were willing. Eventually, Lord Baltimore’s men were forced to surrender on August 1, 1689.</p>

<p id="auto_b1cee49d-6bed-4cd9-839b-5bc3bec77034_fs-idm388263744">With a new Protestant governor in place, Marylanders openly passed a wave of repressive, anti-Catholic religious and civil measures. The Toleration Act was revoked again, Catholic worship was banned, and Catholics were barred from voting. The ground-breaking religious freedom that Maryland’s Catholics had extended to Protestants in 1649 was not enjoyed again until the time of the American Revolution. Eventually, the principle of religious liberty that Maryland first put forward in the Toleration Act was expanded to include non-Christians and was enshrined in U.S. law.</p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm413432112">In the summer of 1630, a fleet of eleven ships bearing more than one thousand settlers landed in Massachusetts. The new arrivals were Puritans whose governor, John Winthrop, preached a sermon in which he announced that their errand was to establish a “city upon a hill” to serve as an example of a purified church and godly society. The Puritans believed the survival of the Massachusetts Bay Colony depended upon a common vision and unity based upon their mutual <span data-type="term">covenant.</span></p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm417042080">Puritan theology was rooted in a belief in predestination—the idea that God, from the beginning of time, had determined who would be saved in heaven and who damned in hell. Individuals’ future status in the afterlife thus did not depend on their actions on earth, though it did manifest itself during the course of their lives. The Puritans believed that individuals who were among “the Elect,” the saved, underwent a conversion experience in which they sensed an overpowering feeling of salvation. Members of the Elect showed outward signs of God’s grace in moral and upright behavior that demonstrated they were “Visible Saints.”</p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm410526960">Men and women were members of the Elect. Women could not be ministers or hold other positions of leadership, although they could hold spiritual meetings in their homes. They gathered in small groups to pray, read the Bible, and review sermons from Sunday services and Thursday lectures (<a href="#auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_BRI_APUSH_02_03_PilgChurch" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm410355584">In 1634, Anne and William Hutchinson moved to the Massachusetts Bay Colony with their several children. William was a wealthy textile merchant who served in several government and church positions. Anne was the daughter of a Puritan clergyman who had run afoul of the authorities of the Church of England and was arrested for his dissenting views. Nevertheless, her father had educated Anne and instructed her thoroughly in scripture and theology. She was a follower of the controversial minister Reverend John Cotton, who had migrated to Massachusetts Bay and started the First Congregational Church. Anne Hutchinson soon became known as an outspoken troublemaker who frequently challenged authority (though otherwise conformed to social expectations as a woman and mother).</p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm409100192">As was common in the colony, Hutchinson began to hold meetings for women in her home. At first, small gatherings of five or six women assembled at her house; however, she was soon hosting two meetings per week for large groups of more than sixty women and men. Participants listened raptly as she spoke from her chair, providing scriptural analysis and commentary on the sermons of the ministers. Women could repeat the content of sermons but were not supposed to comment on them, especially for men. Like Reverend Cotton, however, Hutchinson began to criticize the idea of “visible sainthood” as constituting a doctrine of “good works,” which resembled what Puritans thought was a corruption of the Catholic Church. She insisted upon a covenant of grace instead, in which individuals were justified by their faith alone. She even walked out of several Sunday services to express her displeasure with differing religious ideas preached from the pulpit. In some ways, her Puritan theology was even more strict than that of the other Puritans of the colony.</p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm410345296">In the summer of 1637, the General Court ordered Hutchinson to stop holding meetings. The government and church authorities thought women should neither teach men nor criticize ministers, because it upset the patriarchal structure of Puritan society in which men ruled families, churches, and government. Their overriding goal was social harmony and obedience to a prescribed set of ideas. Nevertheless, Hutchinson persisted because she felt a duty to attend to her fellow Puritans’ spiritual needs and to discuss biblical and doctrinal truths with them.</p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm406547776">By November, however, the authorities had had enough of Hutchinson’s public opinions and defiance. At age forty-six years and pregnant, she was arrested and put on trial for <span data-type="term">sedition</span> before Governor John Winthrop and forty other deputies of the court. As the proceedings opened, Winthrop read the charges against Hutchinson: She had seditiously criticized the ministers and taught <span data-type="term">heretical</span> religious views contrary to common opinion. Her views were dangerous to the colony because they threatened to “seduce many honest persons” and spread heresy that would destroy the common good. The governor thought this especially perilous because Hutchinson was a woman. As Winthrop pointed out to her directly, expressing these views was “a thing not tolerable nor comely in the sight of God nor fitting for your sex.”</p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm410379104">Hutchinson was intelligent, quick-witted, and profoundly knowledgeable about scripture. She ably and courageously defended herself against the charges of the mostly hostile panel of judges and challenged them to point out specifically how she had violated the law or scripture with her views. “I am called here to answer before you,” she said, “but I hear no things laid to my charge.” When Winthrop asked why she held her weekly meetings, she vehemently replied, “It is lawful for me to do so.” When he asked whether it was appropriate for her to teach men, she wryly responded, “Why do you call me to teach the court?”</p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm412939856">In making its case against her, the court called six ministers to testify about Hutchinson’s preaching. These men noted that she was “not only difficult in her opinions, but also of an intemperate spirit.” Hutchinson withstood the inquiry, answering questions boldly and honestly. Two days into the trial, she openly claimed to have learned God’s will through an immediate revelation. Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley scoffed, “How! An immediate revelation.” Hutchinson replied without hesitation, “By the voice of His own spirit to my soul.”</p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm404331152">With those words, her fate in the colony was sealed. The ministers would not accept this challenge to their spiritual authority, especially from a woman. They did not accept the claim that a person could experience an immediate divine revelation. Expecting the worst, Hutchinson vowed, “Now if you do condemn me for speaking what in my conscience I know to be truth, I must commit myself unto the Lord.”</p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm409103552">After several days of testimony, Winthrop issued the court’s verdict. “The court,” he said, “hath already declared themselves satisfied concerning the things you hear, and concerning the troublesomeness of her spirit and the danger of her course amongst us, which is not to be suffered.” Hutchinson was convicted of sedition and heresy and sentenced to be jailed and then banished from the colony as a woman “unfit for our society” the following spring. Because of the idea of a covenant that bound New England society together religiously, politically, and socially, the community could not keep an unrepentant heretic among them or they would be punished collectively by God. When Hutchinson demanded, “[Why] I am banished?” Winthrop replied, “Say no more. The court knows [why] and is satisfied.”</p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm413281344">Hutchinson was also excommunicated from the church. The next year, 1638, she, her husband, their fourteen children, and sixty of her followers moved to the island of Aquidnick (Rhode Island), a haven for religious dissenters. In 1642, after the death of her husband, Hutchinson and her youngest children moved to the Dutch colony of New Netherlands (New York). The Siwanoy Indians on Long Island launched a retaliatory raid against several outlying settlements there a year later and killed Hutchinson and all but one of her children.</p>

<p id="auto_f19406a2-2688-4d44-88c6-0e1192246288_fs-idm413068128">Although some interpreters paint Hutchinson as a victim of Puritan repression or a hero of modern feminism, the truth is more complex. A woman who risked everything for the courage of her convictions, she was silenced pushing the boundaries of patriarchy. Yet, she was also uncompromising in her orthodox religious beliefs and held views that challenged the unity of the fledgling colony. The banishment of Anne Hutchinson revealed many tensions within Puritan society.</p>

Being much troubled to see the falseness of the constitution of the Church of England, I had like to have turned Separatist. . . . The Lord knows that I could not open scripture; he must by his prophetical office open it unto me. So after that being unsatisfied in the thing, the Lord was pleased to bring this scripture out of the Hebrews. he that denies the testament denies the testator, and in this did open unto me and give me to see that those which did not teach the new covenant had the spirit of antichrist, and upon this he did discover the ministry unto me; and ever since, I bless the Lord, he hath let me see which was the clear ministry and which the wrong. Since that time I confess I have been more choice and he hath left me to distinguish between the voice of my beloved and the voice of Moses, the voice of John the Baptist and the voice of antichrist, for all those voices are spoken of in scripture. Now if you do condemn me for speaking what in my conscience I know to be truth I must commit myself unto the Lord.</p>
<p>Mr. Nowel [assistant to the Court]: How do you know that was the spirit?</p>
<p>Mrs. H.: How did Abraham know that it was God that bid him offer his son, being a breach of the sixth commandment?</p>
<p>Dep. Gov.: By an immediate voice.</p>
<p>Mrs. H.: So to me by an immediate revelation.</p>
<p>Dep. Gov.: How! An immediate revelation.”</p>

<p id="auto_f049cf5d-5a91-4dfa-99f3-6ade5158dc0e_fs-idm410388816">As he disembarked from his ship onto the western shore of the Delaware River in 1682, William Penn surveyed the green country in front of him. The thirty-eight-year-old Englishman could not help contrasting this strange, expansive land with memories of the cramped prison cell he had occupied twenty years earlier back in England.</p>

<p id="auto_f049cf5d-5a91-4dfa-99f3-6ade5158dc0e_fs-idm411194464">Penn was part of a religious sect known as the Society of Friends. Its members were called “Quakers” by their enemies because their intense meetings sometimes led members to shake in fits of spiritual fervor. During the 1660s, Englishmen harshly persecuted the Quakers, whom they considered to be dangerous radicals because of their teachings on social and religious equality. Even though he was an English aristocrat, the young Penn had been imprisoned for his illegal preaching and publication of Quaker doctrines. As a result, he became an ardent activist for religious freedom. During the 1670s, he began to dream of a colony where Quakers—and all kinds of Christians—would be free to worship as they saw fit. This dream became a reality when King Charles II offered him title to a large expanse of land in the New World to pay off a substantial debt the crown owed to Penn’s family. Now, in 1682, Penn finally stood on the shores of the colony of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p id="auto_f049cf5d-5a91-4dfa-99f3-6ade5158dc0e_fs-idm411193968">Penn had high hopes that the colony would enjoy religious freedom, as well as peace with the Lenni Lenapes and other American Indians who had lived in this land for centuries. Like all Quakers, he was a pacifist, and he was adamant that his new colony would avoid the bloodshed and war between Indians and other English colonists that had occurred in New England and Virginia. One year before his trip across the Atlantic Ocean, Penn had written a letter to the “Kings of the Indians,” explaining that he was coming to settle in their land. He regretted the “unkindness and injustice” that Indians had experienced from other Europeans and promised that Pennsylvania would be different. Because God commanded his people to love others, his colony would treat the Indians with honesty, fairness, and peace.</p>

<p id="auto_f049cf5d-5a91-4dfa-99f3-6ade5158dc0e_fs-idm416356240">Having arrived, Penn worked on bringing his plans to fruition. The Quakers refused to take any land unless the Indians agreed to it. During the first couple of years, Penn purchased land from the Lenape and Susquehannock leaders, including large areas along the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers. As he stood side by side with the Indian leaders and signed the purchase contracts (<a href="#auto_f049cf5d-5a91-4dfa-99f3-6ade5158dc0e_BRI_APUSH_02_03_PennTreaty" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), he may have felt a measure of pride that his land was being honestly bought rather than stolen from the Indians. However, he did not realize that these peaceful transactions were being aided by forces beyond his control. Since Europeans had arrived in the New World, disease and war had reduced the Lenni Lenapes to a mere five thousand people. Their alliance with the English thus provided much-needed protection from their rivals, the Iroquois League, the most powerful Indian alliance in the region, and contributed to their willingness to sell their land.</p>

<p id="auto_f049cf5d-5a91-4dfa-99f3-6ade5158dc0e_fs-idm407095872">Not long after the ink on the purchase agreement was dry, the Quakers began to build a city on the land between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers. They optimistically proclaimed that their capital would be a “City of Brotherly Love.” The capital’s grid-patterned streets were soon bustling (<a href="#auto_f049cf5d-5a91-4dfa-99f3-6ade5158dc0e_BRI_APUSH_02_03_PhilCity" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Only four years after Penn landed, the colony was home to a diverse group of more than eight thousand settlers of many different religions and ethnicities: Quakers, Anglicans, Dutch Calvinists, German Lutherans, and many Christians who had been persecuted in England, including Presbyterians, Baptists, and Catholics. These colonists had to obey Pennsylvania’s moral laws—no swearing, no “wildness,” and certainly no “whoredom or fornication”—to promote a healthy civic society. However, they were free to practice their own religion as long as they believed in “the one Almighty and eternal God.”</p>

<p id="auto_f049cf5d-5a91-4dfa-99f3-6ade5158dc0e_fs-idm407906352">In spite of good intentions to foster religious harmony and toleration, the City of Brotherly Love was not entirely peaceful. In the early 1690s, a Quaker missionary and pastor named George Keith grew concerned that Philadelphia’s Quakers had departed from the teaching of the Bible, relying too much on the “inward light” of the Spirit. The leading Quakers thought him too divisive and removed him as pastor. Keith ignored this judgment and increased his criticism, arguing that Quaker ministers had been corrupted by their own political influence. After he proclaimed that the top Quaker magistrate’s “name would stink,” Keith was indicted for <span data-type="term">libel</span>. The dispute culminated in an attempt by Keith and his followers to set up their own gallery in the Philadelphia meetinghouse, at which point a brawl broke out and both galleries were destroyed. Keith’s followers eventually dwindled in number, and he returned to England. This dispute showed the difficulty Quakers had in maintaining authority and religious orthodoxy in their own city. Even though Pennsylvania aspired to harmony between Christians of all kinds, it still experienced strife and rivalry within its own denominations.</p>

<p id="auto_f049cf5d-5a91-4dfa-99f3-6ade5158dc0e_fs-idm410376032">Nonetheless, Penn’s colony was undoubtedly a religious and commercial success. The prospect of religious freedom attracted many middle-class merchants, farmers, and traders from Europe, and Philadelphia’s population quickly surpassed that of the much older New York City. Commerce flourished as Philadelphia’s Quakers engaged in a profitable trade with their fellow Quakers in Boston, New York, and the West Indies. In spite of many Quakers’ reservations about slavery, slaves and slave trading did become common in Philadelphia. Moreover, many poor whites from Britain and Europe migrated as indentured servants and owed their labor for a time to their masters. However, the climate of the colony’s western backcountry favored the growing of wheat over the much more labor-intensive tobacco. As a result, fewer slaves were needed, and small, independent farms thrived.</p>

<p id="auto_f049cf5d-5a91-4dfa-99f3-6ade5158dc0e_fs-idm406352464">William Penn’s experiment in religious and political liberty paid dividends for his colony. Philadelphia became a place where Quakers, Baptists, and Presbyterians all practiced their religion freely without an established church. The capital also had a growing economy. Pennsylvania treated American Indians with justice even as the settlers moved west and established prosperous small farms. The colony became a model of religious liberty and justice in British North America.</p>

<p id="auto_8b4a73ad-4dc5-446c-8a9c-3e37b60fe879_fs-idm416701312">In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, European explorers of North America competed to find a Northwest Passage to the East Indies and precious metals such as gold and silver. They did not succeed, but they did encounter American Indians who traded ample amounts of beaver and other pelts with them. The valuable fur trade thus became part of the search for wealth in the New World and the imperial struggle among the great powers. Over the course of the next century, the fur trade fundamentally reshaped American Indian life, relationships with Europeans, and even the North American ecological landscape.</p>

<p id="auto_8b4a73ad-4dc5-446c-8a9c-3e37b60fe879_fs-idm408685712">The early European explorers and fishermen who roamed the Atlantic coast in the 1500s traded knives, copper kettles, and beads to the American Indians for beaver, fox, otter, lynx, mink, and other furs. Both sides in these trades were shrewd; the American Indians hunted furs easily and, in return, acquired items they wanted, while the Europeans thought the Indians accepted trifles for furs that fetched high prices in Europe. The trade helped shape their relationships over the next two centuries.</p>

<p id="auto_8b4a73ad-4dc5-446c-8a9c-3e37b60fe879_fs-idm416150352">When the Europeans came, there were an estimated sixty million to two hundred million beavers in North America. The animals had a beneficial effect on the environment, because their dams served as a means of flood control and created ponds with rich silt that made for fertile soil. The American Indians hunted them with bows, primarily for their fur and meat, and generally killed only as many as they needed. They supplied the traders with furs in increasing numbers because Europeans wore them as fashionable hats.</p>

<p id="auto_8b4a73ad-4dc5-446c-8a9c-3e37b60fe879_fs-idm406040368">The fur trade reshaped American Indian life, however. Indians acquired brass kettles, axes, hatches, farm implements, and metal fishing hooks that altered the way they lived. Firearms changed the way they hunted and the way they went to war with each other and with Europeans. Wider trade networks brought once-isolated American Indians into contact, helping diseases to which they were vulnerable, such as smallpox, spread more easily. Once they realized the Indians would trade for wampum (white and purple beads shaped from shells), the Europeans acquired it from coastal Indians to trade with interior tribes for furs. Thus, American Indians made and acquired greater amounts of wampum, causing it to then decline in value as a medium of exchange. They began to consume alcohol obtained from Europeans, at first using it for spiritual trances but then drinking it in destructive quantities. Finally, American Indians began to wear European clothing they acquired through trade (<a href="#auto_8b4a73ad-4dc5-446c-8a9c-3e37b60fe879_BRI_APUSH_02_03_Ninigret" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_8b4a73ad-4dc5-446c-8a9c-3e37b60fe879_fs-idm414810656">The fur trade was not one sided, and it created a mutual dependency. Because Europeans depended on American Indians to supply thousands of furs to trading posts and colonial settlements, the fur trade linked the Indians to the broader Atlantic system of trade through a valuable <span data-type="term">commodity</span> that was easily transportable. The Indians could play the Europeans off against each other or force them to help some native tribes battle others to maintain the fur trade. For example, the Huron and Algonquian compelled the French to fight against the Five Nations Iroquois. Moreover, French, Dutch, and English settlements were often affected by the geography of the fur trade. The focus on the fur trade meant that the French in Canada developed simple trading posts in Quebec and Montreal rather than large colonies with many settlers. Trading posts began to spread to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley by the mid-eighteenth century, which helped cause the French and Indian War when the English wanted to seize control of the lucrative fur trade. The Dutch settled in Albany and then in Manhattan as the Dutch West India Company entered the fur trade and built fortified settlements to protect it. The English moved into the Connecticut Valley in part because of the fur trade. European colonists also routinely raided each other’s trading posts to control the fur trade throughout the colonial period.</p>

<p id="auto_8b4a73ad-4dc5-446c-8a9c-3e37b60fe879_fs-idm412794528">Sometimes the fur trade helped create intimate relations between the American Indians and Europeans. The French were generally noted for living among the Indians, learning their languages, and treating them more respectfully than did the English. In time, some daring, young, entrepreneurial backwoodsmen known as <em data-effect="italics">coureurs de bois</em> (“runners of the woods”) paddled canoes along the frontier to hunt their own furs. They learned Indian ways, languages, and hunting methods, and some married Indian women. Sometimes, however, Indians saw them as competitors and bloody conflicts resulted.</p>

<p id="auto_8b4a73ad-4dc5-446c-8a9c-3e37b60fe879_fs-idm410376032">By the 1660s, there were troubling signs that beaver and other animal populations were in decline because of the tremendous demand. In one six-year period, for example, the trader William Pynchon alone bought nine thousand beaver furs and hundreds of moose, otter, raccoon, muskrat, and other furs. American Indians hunted growing numbers of animals, especially when they acquired firearms and brass and iron for arrows from the Europeans, and wiped out local animal populations. As they traveled farther to hunt pelts, they came into conflict with other tribes, causing wars to break out or traditional alliances and trade partnerships to shift. In the next few decades, changing fashion led to declining European demand for furs, which, in turn, affected imperial rivalries and relationships with native people. Meanwhile, the effects of declining animal populations like beavers upset local ecosystems, which affected humans.</p>

<p id="auto_8b4a73ad-4dc5-446c-8a9c-3e37b60fe879_fs-idm408519568">The fur trade had widespread economic, strategic, cultural, and environmental effects upon the landscape of North America and the many different people who inhabited the continent. The American Indians and the Europeans all acted in an economically and strategically rational manner, seeking to acquire the goods they needed and wanted. Still, the fur trade resulted in many unintended changes that had a broad impact on North America and even Europe in the colonial era as the colonists brought a new system of private property and ownership.</p>

<p id="auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_fs-idm407687696">By the 1670s, the English had expanded throughout the Chesapeake region. Steadily, the settlers in Virginia <span data-type="term">encroached</span> on American Indian lands, and wherever the two groups came into contact, there was friction. In 1675, a Potomac River planter named Thomas Mathew had a trade disagreement with the Doeg Indians. It escalated when Matthew and his neighbors killed several Doegs attempting to steal livestock. The Doeg retaliated by killing an Englishman. The local militia marched in pursuit. They followed the Doeg to their cabin and attacked them. Then the militiamen came upon a cabin of peaceful Susquehannock hunters and attacked them as well. This action prompted a war with the Susquehannock, who raided frontier settlements and killed dozens of English settlers over the next few months.</p>

<p id="auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_fs-idm415582832">The governor, Sir William Berkeley, his council, and Virginia’s legislative body, the House of Burgesses, met in Jamestown to debate the war against the Susquehannock. The leadership of the colony planned a series of fortifications and patrols along the frontier. Many, however, disagreed with that strategy. First, it was expensive. Virginians, in particular middle-class and poor Virginians, were suffering economically. Second, it seemed to many that the strategy was insufficiently aggressive. By the 1670s, a significant number of English settlers believed all American Indians were enemies, even groups allied with the English. Many also felt entitled to expand onto Indian lands. They advocated all-out war. The governor’s strategy, it seemed to them, protected the enemy and prevented farmers from acquiring more land. These war advocates found an ally in a young leader named Nathaniel Bacon. Bacon was a recent but influential immigrant from a prominent, wealthy family. Upon arriving in Virginia, he had received an appointment to the governor’s council.</p>

<p id="auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_fs-idm410459264">When Indians attacked one of his plantations and killed one of his overseers, Bacon raised the militia of Henrico and Charles City Counties. He demanded that Governor Berkeley give him a commission to war against the Indians. The governor described Bacon as a “young, unexperienced, rash, and inconsiderate person” and refused. Bacon played on popular fears, charging that the governor was corrupt and secretly aiding the Indians. Ignoring Berkeley’s authority, Bacon, with three hundred men, pursued the Susquehannock as far as the Roanoke River. There, he persuaded the Occaneechi nation (long-time trading partners and English allies) to attack the Susquehannock. When the Occaneechi returned with Susquehannock captives, Bacon turned on them as well and killed men, women, and children.</p>

<p id="auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_fs-idm404382208">Governor Berkeley declared Bacon a rebel, thereby making him an outlaw. He expelled Bacon from the council and called for a new General Assembly election. Unfortunately for Berkeley, however, Bacon’s actions had struck a chord with many poorer Virginians, and his movement grew. His followers demanded more than just a harsher Indian policy. Tobacco prices had fallen in recent years, making it more difficult to pay taxes, and small farmers struggled. Berkeley’s plan to levy more taxes and build a series of forts would make these farmers’ financial situation even worse. In addition, many of them depended on trade relationships with the very gentlemen planters who ran the local and colonial government that levied the taxes. More settlers came to believe that Berkeley and other gentlemen were not looking out for the common Virginian.</p>

<p id="auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_fs-idm406194288">Even though Bacon was an outlaw, the people of Henrico County elected him their representative to the General Assembly. He sailed to the capital with fifty armed bodyguards and on June 6 arrived at Jamestown to take his seat. After a force loyal to the governor fired on his vessel, however, Bacon surrendered to Berkeley and was jailed. The next day, Bacon apologized to the governor on his knees and swore allegiance to the government. Berkeley, thinking he had made his point, readmitted Bacon to the governor’s council. When some demanded that the governor give Bacon a commission to wage war against the Indians, Berkeley refused and expelled Bacon from the council.</p>

<p id="auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_fs-idm414779984">Bacon fled Jamestown and assembled a force of five hundred supporters who marched on the government, arriving in Jamestown on June 23. The rebels formed up in front of the state house and drew their arms. Governor Berkeley appeared before them. In a dramatic moment, he bared his chest and dared Nathaniel Bacon to kill him (<a href="#auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_BRI_APUSH_02_03_FairMark" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Bacon’s followers menacingly aimed their muskets at the windows of the House of Burgesses. Members of the General Assembly intervened. They agreed to grant the commission and name Bacon commander of the army to pursue the Indians. In addition, Bacon gained a pardon for himself and his men for all acts of rebellion since March 1.</p>

<p id="auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_fs-idm413363248">Tensions between Berkeley’s supporters and Bacon’s allies continued, however. In July, Berkeley again declared Bacon a rebel. This time, Bacon marched his army to Middle Plantation (known as Williamsburg today) and issued a declaration of grievances against Berkeley’s misrule. Indentured servants and slaves joined the rebel army, alarming wealthy loyalist planters. Berkeley, with a group of his supporters, fled to Virginia’s eastern shore. In August, he called a gathering of the colony’s leading men, and seventy of them swore allegiance to him. Bacon, acting the part of Virginia’s self-appointed governor, called for the election of a new House of Burgesses. He also confiscated the lands of Berkeley loyalists.</p>

<p id="auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_fs-idm410767664">Bacon expanded his war on American Indians and attacked the Pamunkey even though they were allies of the English. The Pamunkey retreated into the swamps of Virginia’s Middle Peninsula, and Bacon’s forces slogged through the mire, unable to capture their adversary. Finally, they stumbled on an encampment and attacked. Forty-five Pamunkey were captured. The remaining fled or were killed.</p>

<p id="auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_fs-idm410890752">Bacon also dispatched a small fleet of ships that summer to find and capture Berkeley and his forces. When they located him in Northampton County, however, the governor deftly captured the ships and executed a handful of rebels. The remaining members of the ships’ crews joined Berkeley. The governor now commanded upward of fourteen ships and controlled Virginia’s waterways. He sailed for Jamestown and on September 8 took the town without firing a shot. Bacon, not far away, laid siege to the governor’s army at Jamestown. Berkeley could not hold the position. On September 18, the governor again retreated to the eastern shore. Bacon retook the town, but knowing he did not have the forces to hold it, he burned it to the ground instead. Jamestown, the capital of the colony of Virginia, had been reduced to ashes.</p>

<p id="auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_fs-idm410396224">Bacon led his army out again to attack Indians and loot the property of suspected Berkeley loyalists. That fall, however, he fell ill with dysentery, and he died on October 26. The rebellion continued despite his death and degenerated into harsh fighting between neighbors. Despite loyalist raids, the rebels continued to control much of Virginia until late December (<a href="#auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_BRI_APUSH_02_03_BaconCast" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Finally, in January, Governor Berkeley was able to return to Jamestown and his plantation at Green Spring.</p>

<p id="auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_fs-idm407093936">In February, English troops and an investigative commission sent by King Charles II arrived. Twenty-three rebels were tried and executed by Berkeley and the commission. Although the commission found that Berkeley had again gained control of the colony, it faulted his handling of the situation. Stung by the commission’s criticisms, Berkeley returned to London. He intended to vindicate himself and defend his actions in an audience with the king, but he was a sick man and died before he could do so.</p>

<p id="auto_802983f4-8952-4fac-a7c7-8a4447a6857f_fs-idm404339840">In the decades following Bacon's Rebellion, the wealthy planters, fearing increased royal control, cut taxes, expanded the suffrage, and pushed the frontier boundaries for land in the hope of creating a more stable society and staving off royal oversight. This continued expansion caused more conflict with American Indians, who found themselves pushed ever farther westward. With better economic conditions in England, the number of people migrating as indentured servants greatly diminished. The large and small planters instead invested in African slaves as a source of labor. Slavery was codified into law, and the number of enslaved persons increased from three hundred in 1650 to thirteen thousand in 1700. Plantations served as community hubs in rural Virginia and the political, economic, and cultural power of the gentry grew in the early eighteenth century. Small and large farmers enjoyed greater prosperity due to rising tobacco prices during that time.</p>

    <div data-type="exercise-stimulus"><p>“In Virginia prior to Bacon’s Rebellion we . . . have black planters and white planters, black indentured servants and slaves, we have white people who are indentured servants and living in un-freedom.</p>
<p>In that kind of world, distinctions between black and white are of course made. But very few people talk about black people as being stupid or dull or ignorant or dirty or lazy. . . .</p>
<p>When we move into the post-Bacon’s Rebellion world where slavery and the plantation economy are in place, where black people are arriving in large numbers from Africa, the view of black people changes very rapidly. It is not simply slavery that transforms notions of race. It is this plantation slavery, the advent of the plantation and disciplined, exploitative labor that begins to transform notions of race.</p>
<p>And it is that which I am concerned with here. It’s not the origins of ideas of race but how race is continually transformed and giving different meanings in different circumstances.”</p>

<p id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm413281344">In January 1692, in the village of Salem, Massachusetts, the nine-year-old daughter and eleven-year-old niece of a contentious minister, Reverend Samuel Parris, began having strange fits and seeing <span data-type="term">apparitions</span> of local women they said were witches. A doctor diagnosed bewitchment, which meant that others were to blame for the girls’ possession, to which Parris responded with prayer. When this failed, Parris pressured the girls to identify the suspected witches. Meanwhile, other girls in Puritan households had supposedly been afflicted. Soon, three women had been accused of witchcraft, including the slave Tituba, who had performed a counter magical spell by baking a witchcraft victim’s urine in a cake and feeding it to a dog. The three women were arrested and jailed. The accusations gathered momentum and a panic set in.</p>

<p id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm409097712">Villagers were emboldened to voice their own suspicions of other witches, which led to more arrests. The accused were brought to the public meetinghouses and urged to confess so they could be brought back into the Christian fold. Most people gave credence to “spectral evidence”—evidence based on visions and dreams—in which the afflicted claimed they could see invisible spirits flying around the room and causing them pain. Even a four-year-old girl, the daughter of one of the accused, Sarah Good, was imprisoned for witchcraft. Before long, the witch hunt had spread to several neighboring communities.</p>

<p id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm408151472">Some people doubted the wild accusations that were tearing apart the communities. For example, Reverend Cotton Mather, a Boston minister, believed in witchcraft but had initial doubts about the outbreak. He questioned the use of spectral evidence, because in English law it was grounds for suspicion but not proof. Mather offered to provide spiritual guidance to the afflicted and cure their ills through prayer and counseling. Unlike the case in most witch hunts, in this one, only those who refused to confess were hanged, for clinging obstinately to Satan.</p>

<p id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm412730560">In May, the governor of Massachusetts, William Phips, set up a special court to deal with the forty-odd people who had been charged. A wealthy merchant, Samuel Sewall, sat on the court, and Lieutenant Governor William Stoughton presided. Many of the accused were perceived to be outsiders in some way, tainted by association with Quakers, American Indians, and non-English European settlers. People living closer to the town were also more likely to be suspects, as kinship groups and sections of town accused other kinship groups and sections of town with whom they were at odds.</p>

<p id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm411358512">The court convened on June 2 for the first trials, and on the basis of unprovable charges and spectral evidence, Bridget Bishop was found guilty and hanged (<a href="#auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_BRI_APUSH_02_03_WSSeal" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). One of the judges, Nathaniel Saltonstall, was so outraged by the proceedings that he immediately resigned. A few days later, several clergymen published a statement, “The Return of Several Ministers,” expressing their own dissatisfaction with the use of spectral evidence and asking for greater burdens of proof. Nevertheless, the trials continued despite the travesty of justice that was recognized at the time. The conviction rate was unusually high, mainly because more than fifty suspects confessed, presumably to evade the noose. Puritans saw in the large numbers only mass allegiance to Satan, which, in turn, led to more accusations. The psychological pressures were intense, and some confessed “witches” recanted, thus sealing their fates.</p>

<p id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm410889392">The court convened again in late June, with more than one hundred accused witches in jail. Five more were tried and executed, followed by another five in August, and eight in September—fourteen women and five men (<a href="#auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_BRI_APUSH_02_03_GJacobs" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Elizabeth Proctor was found guilty but received a reprieve because she was pregnant. Giles Corey, who refused to plead, was pressed to death beneath a growing blanket of stones; his wife Martha was hanged. The deaths caused profound unease, including among previously enthusiastic ministers and magistrates. Reverend Increase Mather delivered a sermon in which he asserted, “It were better that ten suspected witches should escape, than that one innocent person should be condemned.”</p>

<p id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm410273696">As in European witch trials (where an estimated sixty thousand accused witches were executed in the preceding centuries), the problem was using spectral evidence as proof, which, it was argued, may have been the Devil’s illusion to foment discord. Perhaps Satan’s goal had been not to recruit witches but to trick the court into executing the innocent. Particular weight had been placed on the girls’ testimony and on the confessions of the accused, both of which were unreliable. In late October, the Massachusetts Court called for a day of fasting and prayer for reflection on the hysteria. A few days later, Governor Phips met with Stoughton to decide the fate of the court and decided to halt the trials. The jailed were released.</p>

<p id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm416692160">Samuel Sewall, one of the judges, regretted the role he had played in the witchcraft trials and wondered whether the subsequent misfortunes of his own family, and of all New England, might be divine punishment for shedding innocent blood. In January 1697, he stood bare headed in church in Boston while the minister read the following apology:</p>

<blockquote id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm416685360">Samuel Sewall, sensible of the reiterated strokes of God upon himself and family; and being sensible, that as to the guilt contracted upon the opening of the late commission of Oyer and Terminer at Salem (to which the order for this day relates) he is, upon many accounts, more concerned than any that he knows of, desires to take the blame and shame of it, asking pardon of men, and especially desiring prayers that God, who has an unlimited authority, would pardon that sin and all other his sins, personal and relative; and according to his infinite benignity, and sovereignty, not visit the sin of him, or of any other, upon himself or any of his, nor upon the land. But that He would powerfully defend him against all temptations to sin, for the future and vouchsafe him the efficacious, saving conduct of his word and spirit.</blockquote>

<p id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm414473056">The jurors apologized later that same year. They admitted that, because they had not been “capable to understand nor able to withstand the mysterious delusions of the powers of darkness,” they were “sadly deluded and mistaken” in believing weak evidence and had caused the deaths of blameless people.</p>

<p id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm408936464">The factors that led to the 1692 Salem witchcraft outbreak were indeed complex. Much of the conflict fueling the trials originated in tensions between a traditional Puritan lifestyle based on piety and subsistence farming, and an increasingly worldly, capitalist outlook. Some Puritans complained of “declension”—a waning of godly ideals beginning in the 1630s, when Massachusetts Bay was settled. Friction between town and village had also developed over governance: Villagers resented paying taxes to maintain a distant town church and wanted independence.</p>

<p id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm416150352">The accusations may also have reflected tension between neighbors. Some scholars blame them on the fantasies and hysteria of children, and possibly even ergotism (a form of poisoning from a potentially hallucination-causing fungus that grows on rye) and an <span data-type="term">encephalitis</span> epidemic. Gender also seemed to be significant: Were propertied women the victims of envious men? The Puritans believed witchcraft was God’s punishment for sin, either by allowing the Devil to convert so many witches or by turning fearful people against innocent neighbors. The Puritans believed in the existence of the Devil and his evil minions, who they thought could intervene in human affairs, tricking some into following them by practicing witchcraft.</p>

<p id="auto_4f3f0497-87c7-4d4c-9ed3-e6f8b2371cb4_fs-idm406194288">The witchcraft outbreak was intensified across New England by political uncertainty during the years between the loss of the Massachusetts charter in 1684 and the granting of a new one by the English crown in 1691. The Glorious Revolution of 1689–1690 led to war with France, which, in turn, reignited war with American Indians in New England. These events all contributed to an atmosphere of profound insecurity and danger, spiritual and physical, though perhaps none really adequately explain the Salem witchcraft outbreak of 1692.</p>

</div>

<p id="auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_fs-idm414847008">The white planters and farmers on the Stono river near Charleston, South Carolina, had reason for concern in the late summer of 1739. A smallpox epidemic had raged through the area the previous year, and yellow fever was spreading. The settlers expected a bumper rice crop of about 35 million pounds for export, but it was hurricane season and they watched the weather closely. Conflict with Spain, Britain’s imperial rival, also caused talk of war to increase in the port city. Most ominously, the settlers were concerned about a recent proclamation from Spanish Florida offering freedom to their runaway slaves.</p>

<p id="auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_fs-idm416510960">The Spanish proclamation went into effect in 1733, but it was enforced only with the arrival of a new Florida governor, Manuel Montiano, in 1737. The previous year, seventy slaves from South Carolina had traveled over water and land as they fled successfully to Florida and freedom. South Carolina planters generally had large plantations of several hundred acres to raise labor-intensive rice and indigo. The wealthier ones owned hundreds of African slaves, who outnumbered white settlers in the colony. Poorer farmers had smaller farms and fewer slaves but were just as interested in controlling the slave population through a variety of means, including whipping, slave patrols, and a version of Christianity that promoted obedience.</p>

<p id="auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_fs-idm412721504">Slaves worked in the colony according to a “task system” in which they completed their work at their own pace under the watchful eye of an overseer. Compared with enslaved people in other regions, they had a fair amount of autonomy to determine the means by which they would labor for their masters. The presence of fewer Europeans enabled these Africans and African Americans to shape their own communal culture in the fields and in their quarters during time off for the Sabbath on Sunday. They resisted the slave system by feigning illness, running away for a few days, or breaking farming implements. But violence ultimately controlled slaves and compelled their labor. Meanwhile, slave owners lived in constant fear that their slaves would revolt and kill them, because they were greatly outnumbered. In August 1739, the colonial assembly passed a law requiring planters to go to church armed in case of a slave revolt or an escape.</p>

<p id="auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_fs-idm416273600">Sometime after midnight on September 9, about twenty slaves working as a crew on a drainage ditch decided to escape to freedom in Florida. Many were Angolans and were led by an enslaved man named Jemmy. They broke into Hutchenson’s general store for the arms and gunpowder sold there. Somehow, they were discovered by two white men, Robert Bathurst and a Mr. Gibbs. The slaves killed the men and left their heads on the front steps. There was no turning back.</p>

<p id="auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_fs-idm416688944">Moving out into the night without a plan, the armed slaves first came upon the home of a planter named Godfrey. They plundered the house and killed Godfrey and his two children before setting fire to the dwelling. With the flames rising, they continued their march southward. Before dawn they reached Wallace’s Tavern, where they drank briefly but heartily and spared the owner because he was known to be kind to his slaves. They proceeded to sack the nearby home of a Mr. Lemy, killing him, his wife, and their child before setting the house ablaze.</p>

<p id="auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_fs-idm407680464">The emboldened slaves traveled along the road, burning six more houses and killing several of the white inhabitants, whether wealthy planters or poor farmers. Some of the slaves in the plantations hid their masters and even drove off the rebels, either too frightened to join the rebellion or genuinely concerned for their owners. Other slaves, however, joined the rebels, whose ranks grew to fifty or sixty.</p>

<p id="auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_fs-idm409222096">As dawn broke, the rebels boldly marched down the road waving a banner and beating a drum to signal other slaves to rebel. They even loudly cried out the word “liberty” for anyone to hear. Destruction was evident in their wake, with flames and smoke rising high into the sky across the landscape. Just then, Lieutenant Governor William Bull and a small group of white planters coincidentally riding along the road spied the formation. Realizing what was happening, Bull and his outnumbered companions wheeled their horses and fled, narrowly eluding capture and sounding an alarm as they went.</p>

<p id="auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_fs-idm413419936">As they marched several more miles, the rebels were joined by additional runaways and numbered almost one hundred. Exhausted from their journey, they stopped in a field to rest, celebrate their freedom, and wait for more of their fellow slaves to join the escape. But suddenly, a group of dozens of armed and mounted white planters converged on them from the south with murderous intent.</p>

<p id="auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_fs-idm410396224">The slaves grabbed their muskets and fired a few hasty shots. The planters descended upon the slaves, dismounted, and loosed a devastating volley into their ranks. After the exchange of gunfire, fourteen slaves were dead or wounded. In the confusion, about thirty escaped into the countryside. Some of the surviving runaways were summarily executed or questioned and then killed. The planters allowed others to return to their plantations and await their fate. Some were killed by their masters; others were whipped and sent back to the fields.</p>

<p id="auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_fs-idm408994176">In the coming weeks, patrols roamed the countryside in a fierce manhunt to capture the runaways (<a href="#auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_BRI_APUSH_02_03_BurnStake" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Whites even employed some friendly American Indians to track them. About a week later, whites discovered a group of ten runaways and killed them in a pitched battle. Georgians over the border were on high alert at their forts and plantations. Eventually, all the rebels were either killed or returned to slavery. Slaves who had protected their masters during the rebels’ march received gifts of money and clothing.</p>

<p id="auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_fs-idm410221616">In October, the colonial assembly met and discussed the events that unfolded during the Stono slave revolt. Several revisions were made to the colony’s slave code in hope of preventing future revolts. Masters were not to work slaves on the Sabbath; they had to provide slaves with adequate food and clothing and could not murder them. At the same time, the colony tightened restrictions on slaves, banning the sale of alcohol to them, not allowing them drums, and preventing masters from teaching them to read or write.</p>

<p id="auto_10d4f53c-a5fa-4b56-8918-6325a29cfb78_fs-idm404382208">The largest and most significant slave rebellion in the British North American colonies, the Stono Rebellion revealed tensions that continued in slave states throughout the next century. Slaves were oppressed by a brutal system of forced labor and sometimes violently rebelled. Slave owners, on the other hand, kept a watchful eye and constantly sought ways to keep slaves obedient and accepting of their condition.</p>

<p id="auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_fs-idm405868736">During a cool October 1740 morning in Kensington, Connecticut, Nathan Cole was hard at work in his field, as he had been since sunrise. Suddenly his labor was interrupted by a passing messenger’s shouts: at 10 o’clock the evangelist George Whitefield was going to preach in nearby Middletown. Nathan immediately dropped his tools in the field, ran to fetch his wife, and saddled his horse. He and his wife joined a throng of others hurrying along the roads to Middletown, afraid they would arrive too late to hear the famous preacher.</p>

<p id="auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_fs-idm404979920">After receiving his degree from Oxford University, Whitefield had begun a life of <span data-type="term">itinerant</span> preaching and evangelism. Rather than expounding on the intricacies of Christian doctrine, he appealed to the emotions of his listeners at home in England, and now, still only twenty-five years old, he had brought his new style to the American colonies (<a href="#auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_BRI_APUSH_02_03_Whitefield" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). For weeks, Nathan Cole had heard reports that Whitefield’s preaching tour of the colonies was drawing huge crowds numbering in the tens of thousands. Many people in the audience experienced the “new birth” of evangelical conversion. Watching the celebrated preacher begin, Cole began to tremble. “My hearing him preach,” he wrote in his diary, “gave me a heart wound.”</p>

<p id="auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_fs-idm408242336">Whitefield’s message was simple: It was not enough to be baptized or go to church. Each individual must be converted by the Holy Spirit of God through a personal, wrenching examination of his or her own corruption and sinfulness. The youthful, twenty-five-year-old English minister held the crowd at Middletown spellbound with his masterful, emotional pleas that each person receive God’s gift of salvation and be “born again.” Countless listeners, including Nathan Cole, were converted.</p>

<p id="auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_fs-idm415591312">Whitefield was not America’s first revival preacher. Just a few years earlier, Jonathan Edwards, a minister in Northampton, Massachusetts, had led a series of awakenings too. Possibly the greatest theologian the colonies had ever produced, Edwards was a master of rhetoric who preached on human sinfulness and the need for divine grace. Most famously, he delivered a 1741 sermon titled <em data-effect="italics">Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God</em> (<a href="#auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_BRI_APUSH_02_03_AngryGod" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Under Edwards’ preaching, a town-wide revival broke out in Northampton from 1734 to 1735. In London, Edwards published a compelling account of this revival, <em data-effect="italics">A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God</em>. As George Whitefield, England’s John Wesley, and other evangelical ministers read Edwards’ narrative, they realized they were part of a series of religious revivals that began in the colonies and spanned the Atlantic. They were in the middle of what historians came to call “The Great Awakening.”</p>

<p id="auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_fs-idm413357056">Over the course of his seven preaching tours of the colonies, Whitefield reached 75 to 80 percent of the population, sometimes addressing crowds that approached thirty thousand listeners. His revivals were controversial. Local ministers resented Whitefield and other traveling preachers coming to their towns uninvited. When revivalists drew massive crowds and preached in public, local ministers and churches worried the preachers were undermining their spiritual authority. Worse, some evangelical preachers, such as New Jersey’s Gilbert Tennent, dared to suggest that many of the established church’s pastors were not converted. Tennent charged that some pastors were Christians only in name, because they had not yet experienced the “new birth.” He called true believers to leave the lukewarm established congregations and join new, “pure” churches.</p>

<p id="auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_fs-idm417045856">In addition to challenging religious authorities, the revivals could also challenge social conventions. Following their conviction that all believers were equal before God, some evangelicals allowed women to “exhort,” or preach informally, during meetings. In Ipswich, Massachusetts, a gathering of evangelicals in 1742 was amazed when a “spirit of prophecy” filled a female convert named Lucy Smith. Smith preached the Gospel to this assembly for over two hours. White evangelicals even ordained converted African Americans and American Indians to preach or be missionaries, although typically only to their own communities. Some evangelicals began to argue that, in light of the Gospel’s implications, slave owning was sinful. These egalitarian impulses were unprecedented in colonial society and challenged racial and social hierarchies, especially in the South.</p>

<p id="auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_fs-idm414790848">Evangelical teaching also challenged barriers based on social class. Uneducated, poor whites with no theological training often felt a strong calling to preach. Their sermons were frequently highly charged, even frenzied, displays of emotion and, according to some critics, resulted in indecent and immoral behavior. However, the messages of these radical preachers resonated with those lower on the social ladder. Common people and American Indians loved the emotional, radical preaching of James Davenport, a college-educated preacher in New England. In 1743, in New London, Connecticut, Davenport and his followers built a bonfire and instructed the audience to throw their religious books into it. Davenport then turned his eye to their fancy clothing (“cambric caps, red-heeled sho[e]s, fans, necklaces, gloves”), all of which deserved to be burned. Davenport led by example, pulling off his own pants and throwing them on the fire. But this action went too far for some audience members. A woman snatched his clothes off the flames and threw them in his face, and his audience rebuked him.</p>

<p id="auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_fs-idm408935056">Many critics thought the emotional appeal of the “New Light” evangelical ministers was foolish and led to social chaos. The New Light ministers rejected the rationalism of the Enlightenment and appealed to the passions of the audience members rather than their reason, which resulted in emotional reaction and immediate conversion. The main source of opposition was conservative pastors of the established churches, particularly Anglicans and Congregationalists. These “Old Light” ministers insisted upon sober and rational sermons and religious practices and rejected the passionate New Light theology and style of the evangelical preachers. The Old Light ministers successfully banned the New Light ministers from preaching in several churches and towns.</p>

<p id="auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_fs-idm416150352">By the late 1740s, the New England revivals had cooled, but the Great Awakening’s effects were widespread and long-lasting as the fervor continued to spread to the southern colonies in the ensuing decades. The revivals had weakened the hold of the established churches in colonial America, and large numbers of Christians joined new evangelical churches like those of the Baptists or Methodists.</p>

<p id="auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_fs-idm413584704">The Great Awakening also contributed to colonial religious liberty by changing the balance of religious power. During the American Revolution and the struggle for individual liberty, Baptists used their new numbers and influence to challenge religious establishments, first in Virginia and then throughout the new nation. Many evangelicals called for an end to government-supported denominations, which received tax money and lands called “glebes” to support ministers and churches. After the Revolution, opposition to established churches helped inspire the First Amendment’s prohibition of the “establishment of religion” and its guarantee of “free exercise” of religion. The founders believed that freedom of conscience was an inalienable right of all individuals. The religious landscape of the new nation was never the same.</p>

<p id="auto_34e9fb20-406f-4c95-9c85-9304cc747c4b_fs-idm416823760">The Great Awakening helped prepare the colonies for the American Revolution. Its ethos strengthened the appeal of the ideals of liberty, and its ministers and the members of the new evangelical faiths strongly supported the Revolution. The drive for religious liberty against a tyrannical religious authority fed into the movement for civil liberty against the unjust political authority of the British in the 1770s. Likewise, the evangelical teaching that each individual believer was equal before God made it easier for people to accept the radical implications of democracy and to question authority. Thus, the same movement that sent Nathan Cole sprinting out of his field that October morning helped set the stage for American independence. The Great Awakening was the most significant religious and cultural upheaval in colonial American history, and helped forge U.S. civil and religious liberties emerging in the mid-eighteenth century.</p>

</div>

<p id="auto_c2f38ccf-f5e1-4300-b219-278cda63351c_fs-idm383959440">Benjamin Franklin stood on the corner of Fourth and Arch Streets in Philadelphia and took in the massive unfinished building in front of him. He remembered how nine years earlier, in 1740, the hall, constructed for the celebrated evangelical preacher George Whitefield, had been the largest in Philadelphia. Now it stood empty, and Franklin pondered what it might become. At forty-three years old, he was a savvy entrepreneur. In 1728, he had set up a printing house where he published several different newspapers, printed hundreds of books on a variety of topics, and, most famously, wrote his popular yearly <em data-effect="italics">Poor Richard’s Almanack</em>. Franklin’s “Poor Richard” offered witty advice and practical tips, encouraging colonists to be thrifty, hard-working, and disciplined. The <em data-effect="italics">Almanack</em> was a smashing success, running for twenty-eight years and selling ten thousand copies annually.</p>

<p id="auto_c2f38ccf-f5e1-4300-b219-278cda63351c_fs-idm407971856">Franklin was an important American scientist, inventor, and printer who was part of the larger Enlightenment, or Age of Reason. The Enlightenment was an international conversation of ideas that took place in the eighteenth century to increase and classify knowledge about the natural world and human condition through reason and experimentation. Scientists and other thinkers joined learned scientific societies, corresponded with one another, and published their discoveries in scientific journals. Their goals were to improve society and humanity.</p>

<p id="auto_c2f38ccf-f5e1-4300-b219-278cda63351c_fs-idm405047712">Although Franklin made plenty of money from his printing, he also believed his work served a greater civic and humane purpose. Newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets were like little beacons of light, spreading knowledge among citizens throughout the land. Printing also helped keep government from becoming corrupt. Franklin remembered how, in 1733, authorities had dragged the New York newspaperman John Peter Zenger into court for criticizing the royal governor, William Cosby. Zenger’s newspaper published articles suggesting that the governor had fired colonial justices who refused to increase his salary. Zenger was found not guilty of libel in the landmark case for freedom of the press. However, colonial authorities continued their attempts to censor newspapers. Franklin knew he had to be clever in using satire and anonymously written pieces if he were to criticize the government in print.</p>

<p id="auto_c2f38ccf-f5e1-4300-b219-278cda63351c_fs-idm409790272">As he studied the giant assembly hall, he wondered how it might serve the cause of enlightening the city’s young men. Franklin believed it was critical for the citizenry in colonial America to be well educated. Along with others who shared the Enlightenment ideals of reason and free inquiry, he felt moral virtue was formed through learning. A virtuous people could then govern themselves in their colonial legislatures and town meetings. In addition to his work as a printer, Franklin had worked hard to spread knowledge throughout the city and improve civic life. In 1727, he created a debating society called the Junto that discussed new ideas, and in 1731, he founded the first public lending library in the colonies, the Library Company of Philadelphia, to promote civic knowledge and virtue. He also helped found a hospital, a fire company, and the militia. Now, in the 1740s, a new idea came into Franklin’s mind as he stood in front of the empty speaking hall. Perhaps this building could be a place of instruction, a beacon of light that would shed rays of truth throughout the colonies.</p>

<p id="auto_c2f38ccf-f5e1-4300-b219-278cda63351c_fs-idm407185584">Franklin quickly drew up a plan for this institution, the Academy of Pennsylvania (later renamed the University of Pennsylvania). All the other colonial colleges had been founded for religious purposes. For example, Harvard College was established in the 1630s to train Puritan ministers. By the early 1700s, it was still committed to Christianity, but it taught its Congregationalist ministers the new “rational” theology instead of Calvinist doctrine. In 1701, a rival institution, Yale College, was founded by ministers who hoped it would maintain traditional Calvinist theology. The College of William &amp; Mary (1693) was run by Virginian Anglicans, and evangelical Presbyterians founded the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1746. Franklin wanted his Academy to be different. Instead of primarily training ministers, it would educate young men to be successful businessmen and public servants.</p>

<p id="auto_c2f38ccf-f5e1-4300-b219-278cda63351c_fs-idm406595376">Unlike other colonial colleges, the Academy would not be run by one Christian denomination. Franklin, who grew up in a strict Calvinist family, had gradually come to think that true religion was about moral virtue rather than a particular set of doctrines. He was skeptical about traditional Christian teaching on salvation, the divinity of Jesus Christ, and the Trinity. He was also convinced, like other Enlightenment thinkers, that the best way for a society to promote virtue was to tolerate all religious beliefs. Governments should not support one particular religion, Franklin argued, but instead trust that truth would prevail through inquiry. His belief in toleration extended to the Academy’s Board of Trustees, which comprised members of several different Christian denominations.</p>

<p id="auto_c2f38ccf-f5e1-4300-b219-278cda63351c_fs-idm410345296">As plans came together for the Academy, Franklin embraced another idea. Instead of following the traditional curriculum, in which students studied ancient languages and Roman and Greek classics, the Academy would teach students knowledge of contemporary arts and sciences. Franklin was a scientist who argued that the Academy should teach “practical knowledge.” Such an education would equip young men to make a good living and to be active citizens. The trustees of the Academy did not share Franklin’s vision, however, and ultimately chose a more traditional curriculum.</p>

<p id="auto_c2f38ccf-f5e1-4300-b219-278cda63351c_fs-idm406547776">Franklin, perhaps the colonies’ most prominent Enlightenment thinker, most famously contributed to human knowledge with his innovative scientific discoveries. He began wondering whether lightning were a form of electricity. In 1750, he published an article suggesting that this could be proven by flying a kite in a lightning storm. Two years later, Franklin decided to try. He stepped out into the streets of Philadelphia as thunder crashed and lightning streaked across the sky and released into the stormy air a kite with a key tied to its string. He watched as the loose threads of the string began to repel each other and, as he moved his hand close to the key, saw it spark. He had proven that lightning was electricity. Franklin won international acclaim as a man of science and corresponded with many of the most important scientists throughout the colonies and Europe (<a href="#auto_c2f38ccf-f5e1-4300-b219-278cda63351c_BRI_APUSH_02_03_BFranklin1" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_c2f38ccf-f5e1-4300-b219-278cda63351c_fs-idm410317920">Though that was Franklin’s most famous experiment, it was by no means his last. An endlessly curious man, Franklin invented <span data-type="term">bifocal</span> glasses and a more fuel-efficient fireplace stove, studied the circulation of currents in the Atlantic Ocean, wrote about theories of light, and made scientific observations of meteorology, refrigeration, and conduction. He did not take out any patents to profit financially from his discoveries, because he wanted all humanity to benefit from the expansion of knowledge. He pursued his scientific work while continuing to publish through his printing press, serving as president of the American Philosophical Society and colonial America’s Postmaster General, and working tirelessly as a political theorist and statesman. Franklin exemplified the enthusiasm and optimism of the Enlightenment. Like Thomas Jefferson and other men and women of the Enlightenment, he believed in the promise of reason and scientific discovery for progress. The new nation that Franklin helped found reflected many of his values: freedom of the press, freedom of religion, the importance of education and learning, healthy civic institutions, and knowledge held by a self-governing citizenry. Franklin’s work as a printer, scientist, and politician helped shed the light of liberty across a new nation. Over the next few decades, the Founders contributed to the American Enlightenment associated with creating a political <em data-effect="italics">novus ordo seclorum</em>—a “new order for the ages.”</p>

<p id="auto_55d408ee-ebad-4f1e-bb7f-b6f1f257e0dc_fs-idm417042080">In 1753, tensions on the American frontier were high because European rivals France and Great Britain were nearly at war over their competing imperial claims in North America. Meanwhile, a group of Mohawk Indians traveled to New York City, where they declared an end to the alliance between the British colonies and Iroquois nations. The Mohawks were the easternmost nation in the Iroquois Confederacy (the other five nations in the confederacy were the Oneidas, Tuscaroras, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas). They were also key players in the Covenant Chain, the alliance that kept the peace between the Iroquois and the northern British colonies. When the British crown learned of the Mohawks’ complaints about land frauds and diplomatic neglect, it ordered the colonial governments to convene a meeting in Albany to address these grievances and restore the alliance.</p>

<p id="auto_55d408ee-ebad-4f1e-bb7f-b6f1f257e0dc_fs-idm404876272">Seven colonies—Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland—sent delegations to Albany in June 1754, where they negotiated with approximately 150 Iroquois. Albany had long served as the geographic center of the Covenant Chain, and it had hosted many previous intercolonial treaty conferences. This one, which eventually became known as the Albany Congress, was different because of the unprecedented number of colonies represented and because of the urgency of the situation. Britain could not afford to go to war against France if the Iroquois were not willing at least to remain neutral.</p>

<p id="auto_55d408ee-ebad-4f1e-bb7f-b6f1f257e0dc_fs-idm410183616">The colonial delegates turned their attention first to renewing the Covenant Chain, which involved exchanging speeches with the Iroquois and providing them with presents. The Crown and colonial governments donated trade goods as material evidence of British regard for their Indian allies. In addition to conducting their business with the Iroquois, the delegates addressed the issue of intercolonial union. Unity among the colonies was an elusive goal because of their many political, economic, religious, and cultural differences.</p>

<p id="auto_55d408ee-ebad-4f1e-bb7f-b6f1f257e0dc_fs-idm383917184">Benjamin Franklin had first proposed the idea of an intercolonial government in 1751, and a month before the Albany Congress convened, he had published his famous “Join, or Die” cartoon in the <em data-effect="italics">Pennsylvania Gazette</em> (<a href="#auto_55d408ee-ebad-4f1e-bb7f-b6f1f257e0dc_BRI_APUSH_02_03_JoinDie" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The political cartoon showed a snake cut into several pieces, which Franklin used to warn his readers about the dangers of division in the face of French encroachments on British claims to the Ohio Valley.</p>

<p id="auto_55d408ee-ebad-4f1e-bb7f-b6f1f257e0dc_fs-idm409051248">As a member of the Pennsylvania delegation in 1754, Franklin drafted "Short hints towards a scheme for uniting the Northern Colonies" before arriving in Albany and circulated it among some friends. Other delegates also arrived in Albany ready to discuss forging such a union to counter the growing threat on the frontier. Massachusetts and Connecticut authorized their delegations to address the matter, reflecting the New England colonies’ long experience of cooperating in their Indian relations and military affairs. Other colonial governments were more suspicious of any plans that might limit their autonomy, however, so most of the delegates arrived in Albany either without authorization to discuss union or with express instructions not to do so.</p>

<p id="auto_55d408ee-ebad-4f1e-bb7f-b6f1f257e0dc_fs-idm413166064">Despite this lack of a <span data-type="term">mandate</span>, the delegates in Albany formed a committee to draft a plan of union, taking Franklin’s “Short Hints” as their starting point. Delegations from each colony were to form an intercolonial legislature called the Grand Council, with representation apportioned according to each colony’s contribution to a common treasury. A royally appointed President General was to work with the Grand Council in the same manner that a royal governor worked with a colonial assembly, having the power to command troops, to negotiate treaties and land purchases with Indians, and to oversee the formation of new colonies in the continent’s interior.</p>

<p id="auto_55d408ee-ebad-4f1e-bb7f-b6f1f257e0dc_fs-idm410567408">The Albany Plan of Union was a creative response to the problems facing the colonies on the eve of the French and Indian War, but it failed to impress the colonial governments or policymakers in Britain. When the delegates carried the plan back to their home governments, they found their efforts greeted mostly by indifference or hostility. None of the colonial assemblies endorsed it. The king’s ministers dismissed it as a threat to royal powers in colonial affairs and only appointed two royal superintendents who would oversee the fur trade, land purchases, and diplomacy with Indian nations.</p>

<p id="auto_55d408ee-ebad-4f1e-bb7f-b6f1f257e0dc_fs-idm412999792">During the Revolutionary era, creating an American political union again became important, but patriots did not cite the Albany Plan as an influence when they attended the Stamp Act Congress (1765), adopted the Articles of Confederation (1777), or ratified the Constitution (1788). Despite his presence in the Continental Congress and Constitutional Convention, Franklin never explicitly linked the Articles of Confederation or the Constitution to the Albany Plan either. Rather, in his <em data-effect="italics">Autobiography</em>, he postulated that had the Albany Plan been adopted in 1754, it might have very well prevented the crisis that drove the colonies and Britain apart a generation later.</p>

<p id="auto_55d408ee-ebad-4f1e-bb7f-b6f1f257e0dc_fs-idm416218448">Some historians have argued that the Albany Plan is evidence of American Indian influence on the ideas that have shaped U.S. democracy and federalism. Proponents of the “Iroquois Influence Thesis” claim that Franklin and several other founders were keen observers of American Indian government, and that, in particular, they were impressed with the way the Iroquois nations used their confederation to preserve their security and power. In a letter he wrote in 1751, Franklin cited the Iroquois as an example of successful political union, stating, “It would be a very strange Thing, if six Nations of ignorant Savages, should be capable of forming a Scheme for such an Union, and be able to execute it in such a Manner, as that it has subsisted Ages, and appears indissoluble; and yet that a like Union should be impracticable for ten or a Dozen English Colonies, to whom it is more necessary, and must be more advantageous; and who cannot be supposed to want an equal Understanding of their Interests.” Franklin never expressed curiosity about how “ignorant Savages” formed or operated the Iroquois Confederacy, however. The other founders of the American nation, when they exhibited any familiarity with the Iroquois, shared similar sentiments, praising the Iroquois for their military power and political unity but generally dismissing them and other American Indians as savages who possessed no government worthy of study or imitation.</p>

<p id="auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_fs-idm403028464">The French and Indian War was the climactic struggle between Great Britain and France for imperial control of North America. The war began in 1754, when a young Virginia militia officer named George Washington engaged in a skirmish with a party of French soldiers, and it ended six years later when the governor-general of New France surrendered to a British army at Montreal. The conflict was part of a much larger global struggle known as the Seven Years’ War that began in 1756 and ended in 1763 among Britain, France, and several other European nations. Although the French and Indian War was only one of several Anglo-French conflicts in North America, it was exceptional for its scale and its influence on the lives of American Indians and colonists.</p>

<p id="auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_fs-idm407806864">Unlike many earlier Anglo-French wars, the French and Indian War originated in North America, in a remote region known as the Ohio country. In the early 1750s, this land became the center of a three-way contest among American Indians, the French, and the British. A loose confederacy of Indian nations dominated by the Delawares, Shawnees, and Senecas populated the Ohio country after migrating from other regions taken over by colonists. There they found a new homeland rich with natural resources, especially the animals that supplied the fur trade. British and French traders competed with each other for this business. The Indians generally preferred British trade goods, which were cheaper and more plentiful, but they had better relations with the French because of New France’s effective missionary work and diplomacy among Indian nations living along the Great Lakes. Regardless of their preference for the French or British, the Ohio Indians shared a common desire to keep European soldiers and settlers out of their territory.</p>

<p id="auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_fs-idm399163600">Tensions in the Ohio country heated up in 1753, when the French sent troops to fortify the passage from Lake Erie to the Ohio River. This move was intended to cement the French claim to the region and to open a route through the interior of the continent that would connect the French colonies in Canada and Louisiana. Virginia and Pennsylvania had their own designs on the Ohio country. Fur traders from both colonies were active there, and both claimed the Ohio country by right of their original royal charters. Pennsylvania, which lacked a militia because of its Quaker origins, was slow to mobilize against the French, but Virginia acted more forcefully. Its governor, Robert Dinwiddie, was an investor in the Ohio Company, a group of entrepreneurs who hoped to profit by opening western lands to settlers. When he learned that the French were occupying the Ohio country, he sent twenty-one-year-old militia officer George Washington to drive them out.</p>

<p id="auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_fs-idm396704560">In his first mission to the Ohio country in 1753, Washington delivered a diplomatic warning to the French, telling them they were encroaching on British territory. The French officers he met politely rebuffed him, and he was disturbed by the efforts he witnessed among the French to win over the Ohio Indians, including his own guide, an influential Seneca named Tanaghrisson. In spring 1754, Governor Dinwiddie sent Washington back to the Ohio country, this time with an army of two hundred militiamen and orders to defend Virginia’s claim to the Forks of the Ohio (modern Pittsburgh). For a guide, Washington again relied on Tanaghrisson, who led him to a party of French soldiers near the British encampment.</p>

<p id="auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_fs-idm409950960">In an ill-advised surprise dawn attack, Washington and his men killed several French soldiers and wounded their commander, Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville. Washington believed he had prevented a French attack on his own men, but Jumonville insisted he had only been on a diplomatic mission, carrying a message from his commander at the French post Fort Duquesne. His protests were cut short when Tanaghrisson stepped forward and killed him with a tomahawk blow to his skull, a move likely intended to force the British into a more aggressive stance against the French.</p>

<p id="auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_fs-idm407147728">After Jumonville’s death, a shaken Washington had his men build a stockade that he named Fort Necessity, in anticipation of a counterattack from Fort Duquesne (<a href="#auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_BRI_APUSH_02_03_Necessity" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). A superior force of French soldiers and Indian warriors soon surrounded the outnumbered and inexperienced Americans. The French and Indians fired on the garrison from covered positions, demoralizing Washington’s men and exhausting his supplies. Washington decided his only option was to surrender, and he claimed he unwittingly signed articles of <span data-type="term">capitulation</span>, written in French, that described him as responsible for the “assassination” of Jumonville. This inadvertent admission became the basis for the French declaration of war against Britain.</p>

<p id="auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_fs-idm408259760">In 1755, the British returned to the Ohio country, this time with an army of regulars and colonists commanded by General Edward Braddock, whom Washington served as an aide-de-camp. Braddock intended to lay siege to Fort Duquesne and then move north to attack the French at Fort Niagara, which guarded the passage from Canada to the Ohio country. Encumbered by artillery and a supply train, Braddock’s troops slowly cut a road through dense wilderness from Fort Cumberland on the Potomac River toward Fort Duquesne. After crossing the Monongahela River on the morning of July 9, Braddock’s army collided with a French and Indian force that took advantage of high ground and cover provided by the surrounding forest to rain their fire on the British. Braddock suffered a fatal wound and Washington narrowly escaped death himself. The destruction of Braddock’s army left the Ohio country firmly in control of the French. Indians allied with the French launched a devastating war against settlements along the Appalachian frontier from Pennsylvania to Virginia (<a href="#auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_BRI_APUSH_02_03_FrIndMap" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_fs-idm393818208">For the next three years, the British struggled to regain their position in the Ohio country. Promoted to colonel of a regiment of Virginia soldiers, Washington worked feverishly to build fortifications and restore security along the frontier. Like many other colonial Americans, he disliked the British policy that gave seniority to British army officers over American officers, regardless of their respective ranks. In 1758, he worked closely with British General John Forbes as Forbes planned a new expedition into the Ohio country. Washington wanted Forbes to follow Braddock’s route west, but Forbes decided instead to cut a new road west from the Susquehanna River. This route favored Pennsylvania’s claim to the Ohio country, and Washington resented Forbes for it.</p>

<p id="auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_fs-idm398232320">In November 1758, Forbes’s army forced the French to abandon Fort Duquesne, but Washington took little pleasure in the victory and soon returned to his home at Mount Vernon to resume his civilian life. Over the course of five years, he had learned much about military leadership and frontier warfare, but his ambitions to become a commissioned officer in the British regular army had been thwarted more often than helped by his British superiors. He had also lost several battles in the early part of the war, but nonetheless, he emerged as a war hero with a growing continental reputation.</p>

<p id="auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_fs-idm404087776">Shortly after Forbes’s victory, the British built Fort Pitt on the ruins of Fort Duquesne. This act, along with the British occupation of other French posts in the Great Lakes region, angered the Ohio Indians because they had been promised in 1758 that the British would evacuate their homelands after the war was won. The Indians were now entirely dependent on the British for their trade goods, and the roads built by Braddock and Forbes became routes for settlers to move into the region.</p>

<p id="auto_68d8e54d-feb7-4194-8699-efcd2e5ffbfd_fs-idm407772096">Violence erupted in 1763 when Indians throughout the Great Lakes attacked western British posts and settlements. This conflict, named Pontiac’s War after the Ottawa chief who led the siege of Detroit, caused the British to issue the Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited land sales and settlement west of the Appalachians and kept soldiers stationed on the frontier to restore peace between Indians and colonists. That policy compounded the frustrations of colonists such as George Washington, who believed the Crown was denying them access to the lands they had helped conquer and had been promised as a bounty for their war service. Britain had won the French and Indian War and driven the French out of North America, but as a result, its empire suffered internal tensions that were to lead to revolution. Great Britain also amassed a massive war debt during the conflict and expected the colonies to begin paying more taxes as a share of their defense.</p>

</div>

<p id="auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_fs-idm405594752">Although the French and Indian War started in the Ohio country, most of its battles were fought along the borderland separating French Canada from New England and New York. French and British soldiers built forts to assert control over important waterways and land routes in this region, while American Indians engaged in their own diplomacy and warfare to protect their homelands.</p>

<p id="auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_fs-idm406260080">In May 1756, General Louis-Joseph, marquis de Montcalm, arrived in Canada to lead the French war effort in North America. He sailed up the St. Lawrence River with an army of hundreds of regular soldiers in six French warships. Montcalm had little regard for the small-scale raiding tactics that had been the hallmark of French and Indian warfare in earlier colonial wars. Instead, he led armies composed of professional soldiers, Canadian militiamen, and Indians against British forts, relying on the siege tactics then commonly used in Europe.</p>

<p id="auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_fs-idm415595488">On the British side, a series of veteran officers came to mobilize the colonies and fight the war against the French and their Indian allies. After the death of General Edward Braddock in 1755, General John Campbell, the Earl of Loudoun, became the British commander-in-chief in America. He was succeeded by General Jeffery Amherst, who worked closely with General James Wolfe to execute British operations against Canada from 1758 to 1760. These British generals quickly grew frustrated with the lack of cooperation they received from the colonial governments and the poor discipline among colonial troops. As the war progressed, they increasingly relied on professional soldiers and sailors from Britain for their operations and fought with European methods and tactics.</p>

<p id="auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_fs-idm415600016">The clash between the colonial and European ways of war was evident in two humiliating defeats suffered by the British at Oswego and Fort William Henry. Located on the southeastern shore of Lake Ontario, Oswego was an important fur-trading post that provided Britain’s sole access to the Great Lakes. Montcalm laid siege to Oswego in August 1756, and the post quickly fell because of poor leadership and morale among the colonial soldiers defending it (<a href="#auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_BRI_APUSH_02_03_Oswego" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). After the surrender, French-allied Indians attacked the garrison, taking scalps, British supplies, and captives despite the efforts of the French to protect their prisoners of war.</p>

<p id="auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_fs-idm408531072">The following summer, the same series of events unfolded on a larger scale when Montcalm attacked Fort William Henry, which guarded the passage from Lake Champlain to the Hudson River. This event became known among British colonists as the “Fort William Henry Massacre,” and it was later dramatized by novelist James Fenimore Cooper in his novel, <em data-effect="italics">The Last of the Mohicans</em> (1826). Cooper’s portrayal of French treachery and Indian savagery became the most enduring image of the French and Indian War in U.S. arts and literature, but he took considerable liberties with his sources. Eyewitnesses at the time praised Montcalm and other French officers for trying to preserve the lives of the British. The Indians, who were not included when Montcalm and his British counterparts negotiated terms of surrender at Oswego and Fort William Henry, attacked the garrisons to acquire their traditional trophies of war.</p>

<p id="auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_fs-idm409284816">British fortunes in the war turned around when Prime Minister William Pitt re-oriented Britain’s resources away from the war’s European theater and toward North America. Pitt believed that Britain’s naval power gave it a considerable advantage over the French in America, and that British victories there could undermine the French war effort elsewhere. He secured greater cooperation from the colonial governments by promising to reimburse them for funds they expended on the war effort, and he sent tens of thousands of British soldiers and sailors to North America, thereby minimizing British dependence on colonial troops. Pitt’s policies expanded the war in North America to an unprecedented scale and committed Britain to the conquest of New France.</p>

<p id="auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_fs-idm405106832">Pitt’s strategy began to pay off in 1758. Under the leadership of Jeffery Amherst and James Wolfe, a massive amphibious force of British soldiers and sailors attacked Louisbourg, the French fortress that guarded the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. After a seven-week siege, Louisbourg fell, opening a seaborne route for the British invasion of Canada. The following year, Amherst and Wolfe split their forces and attacked Canada from two directions. Amherst led an army northward from Albany, forcing the French to abandon their forts at Crown Point and Ticonderoga along Lake Champlain as he drove toward Montreal. Meanwhile, Wolfe led a fleet of British warships and troop transports up the St. Lawrence River for an amphibious assault on Quebec, the capital of New France. For several weeks, Wolfe bombarded the city with artillery fire and terrorized the surrounding countryside, but Montcalm’s forces hunkered down behind the city’s walls and tried to wait out Wolfe’s supplies and patience.</p>

<p id="auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_fs-idm406255056">On the night of September 12, Wolfe executed a daring maneuver, using the cover of darkness to have his men scale cliffs leading from the river to the Plains of Abraham, high ground west of Quebec. Early the next morning, Montcalm rushed to meet the enemy army that had suddenly appeared outside his city’s walls. In the ensuing battle, both Wolfe and Montcalm received fatal wounds. Wolfe died as the battle raged, but Montcalm survived until the next day. Despite the loss of their commander, the British broke the French lines and won a quick victory. Their moment of triumph was immortalized by American painter Benjamin West in his masterpiece <em data-effect="italics">The Death of General Wolfe</em> (1770). British subjects on both sides of the Atlantic celebrated Wolfe as a national martyr, and in 1772, a monument in his honor was placed in London’s Westminster Abbey. The conquest of New France was completed nearly a year after Wolfe’s death, when Montreal surrendered to General Amherst (<a href="#auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_BRI_APUSH_02_03_Wolfe" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_fs-idm410846432">After the fall of Canada, the Seven Years’ War continued in theaters around the globe, finally ending in the Peace of Paris in 1763. For colonial Americans, the most significant results of this treaty were Britain’s acquisition of Canada from the French and of Florida from the Spanish. Britain now controlled all of North America east of the Mississippi River, but it also faced a host of new problems in governing its empire there. It had to incorporate a French-speaking population of former enemies, as well as restore peace among Indian nations that were anxious to resume the fur trade but resented the British army’s occupation of their homelands.</p>

<p id="auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_fs-idm414823808">Amherst tried to reduce the expenses of Britain’s Indian diplomacy by decreeing that Indian agents would no longer distribute trade goods as diplomatic gifts. He also mandated deep reductions in the amount of gunpowder traded to the American Indians formerly allied with the French. These policies angered Indians in the Great Lakes region, who believed Amherst was trying to enslave them. They rose up in Pontiac’s War in 1763, challenging British control of the trans-Appalachian West. This crisis led to the Crown’s imposition of the Proclamation of 1763, which forbade colonial land purchases and settlement west of the Appalachians until authorized by royal officials. The proclamation angered the colonists who felt entitled to expand onto new lands, based upon Lockean property rights to settle and improve property in recognition of their sacrifice and contribution to the war effort. Despite the Proclamation, settlers still moved west.</p>

<p id="auto_a27b752b-c72b-416e-a222-96ca676b7c8b_fs-idm410436032">The conquest of Canada had been a stunning victory for Britain but also an expensive one. Britain’s national debt doubled during the Seven Years’ War, and now the Crown had to figure out a way to pay for governing its new North American dominions. Britain had to maintain thousands of troops on distant frontiers and pay the salaries of officials charged with governing vast new territory. Beginning in 1764, the British Parliament passed a series of acts intended to strengthen British rule in the colonies and extract from the inhabitants more taxes and customs revenues. These new policies angered the colonists, who had <span data-type="term">incurred</span> substantial war debts of their own and were tired of being treated like second-class citizens. The colonists’ persistent opposition to British taxation without representation eventually led to revolution.</p>

<p id="auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_fs-idm398663776">The <em data-effect="italics">Mayflower</em> set sail from the English port of Plymouth on September 6, 1620. A leaky old wine ship, it carried 102 passengers, plus around thirty crewmen and various livestock. The passengers were mostly English members of a dissenting <span data-type="term">Separatist</span> congregation that had lived in exile in the Dutch city of Leiden, together with their servants. Also traveling on the <em data-effect="italics">Mayflower</em> were people the other passengers called “strangers.” These were a mixed group of emigrants recruited by the Merchant Adventurers, a trading company based in London that had invested in the journey as a commercial opportunity.</p>

<p id="auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_fs-idm406198048">Separatists were those men and women who believed the Protestant Reformation should have swept all remnants of the old Catholic ritual out of the Church of England. Whereas English Puritans wanted to purify the Church of England from within, Separatists did not believe this was possible and left the church instead. They refused to abide by the teaching of the Church of England (the established or orthodox faith of the land), were persecuted, and fled England for Holland and then New England. Their chronicler and later governor of the Plymouth Colony, William Bradford, described their plight: “Religion has been disgraced, the godly grieved, afflicted, persecuted, and many exiled, while others have lost their lives in prisons and other ways; on the other hand, sin has been countenanced, ignorance, profanity, and atheism have increased, and the papists have been encouraged to hope again.”</p>

<p id="auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_fs-idm360368064">The group of Separatists remained in Holland for a decade, suffering persecution and corrupting worldliness. With religious and political tensions rising in Europe, they feared for their security and freedom. Faced with these fears, they saw an alternative in the wilderness of North America. Perhaps there they could find the freedom to pursue their faith and live away from the corrupting influence of the Old World and establish a pure church. They had a choice of whether to remain in the known world and risk continuing persecution or whether to face the dangers of the Atlantic and an unknown continent on which to build a pure church. They chose the path fraught with many difficulties and dangers. They would be pilgrims to the new world.</p>

<p id="auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_fs-idm391283936">The ocean crossing was particularly stormy, terrifying everyone on board, especially when a cracked beam threatened to sink the ship. The passengers suffered seasickness and scurvy during the miserable journey and wondered whether they would arrive safely at distant shores. They decided to trust the will of God, and they bravely proceeded. The journey took eight weeks, during which two people died and two babies were born. On November 9, the group sighted Cape Cod, which was several hundred miles north of their intended destination in Virginia.</p>

<p id="auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_fs-idm402896448">With North America in sight, this group, later known as the Pilgrims, had to determine the kind of community they were creating. Some passengers were unhappy with the decision to stay in Cape Cod rather than continue to their original destination. The resulting friction led them to draw up an improvised means of preserving order and governing the colony according to just principles—the “Mayflower Compact”:</p>

<blockquote id="auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_fs-idm404525040">Having undertaken, for the glory of God and advancements of the Christian faith and honour of our king and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia, [we] do by these presents . . . covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body politic; for our better ordering and preservation and furtherance of the ends aforesaid; and by virtue hereof to enact, constitute, and frame such just and equal laws, ordinances, acts, constitutions, and offices, from time to time, as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the general good of the colony, unto which we promise all due submission and obedience.</blockquote>

<p id="auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_fs-idm389126128">Those who signed the document bound themselves to a rule of law and cooperation for the common good in facing the dangers ahead. They were now knit together into a government and a civil society. They decided that they would seek the common good through good government rather than merely their own private self-interests (<a href="#auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_BRI_APUSH_02_04_MCompact" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

It was written and signed aboard the ship in 1620, and no original drafts survive.

<p id="auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_fs-idm361218400">The first scouts went ashore on November 11 and took maize from American Indians’ grain stores; there is some question whether they stole it or paid for it. They had very few provisions and faced a brutal winter during which their clothes froze on their bodies. When, the following month, Nauset Indians fired arrows at them, the scouts decided to sail across Cape Cod Bay and settle there instead. Meanwhile, their fellow migrants remained on the <em data-effect="italics">Mayflower</em>, suffering from cold, malnutrition, and disease. The survival of the colony was very much in doubt.</p>

<p id="auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_fs-idm397163824">The survivors did not disembark until March 1621, by which time half the passengers and crew had died. They named their new home Plymouth, after their place of departure, but the American Indians who had lived there had named it Patuxet (<a href="#auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_BRI_APUSH_02_04_PHarbor" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Bradford, soon to be governor of the new colony, recorded how the Pilgrims “fell upon their knees and blessed the God of heaven who had brought them over the vast and furious ocean, and delivered them from all the perils and miseries thereof, again to set their feet on the firm and stable earth.”</p>

<p id="auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_fs-idm388872064">After disembarking, the Pilgrims were met with more reminders of death: Littering the beach were the bleached bones of American Indians who had had earlier contact with Europeans and been wiped out by diseases to which they had no immunity. Bradford interpreted the death of the local population as part of a divine plan for the Pilgrims to create a commonwealth in North America and spread the gospels to “godless Indians.”</p>

<p id="auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_fs-idm406561120">The Pilgrims, the “strangers,” and the crew hauled the ship’s cannon up the hill, where they built a defensive timber fortress within which their settlement of homesteads and storehouses took shape. Massasoit, chief of the Wampanoag confederation, sent an envoy, Squanto, who had survived the epidemic at Patuxet, probably because he had been a slave in London and had acquired some immunity there. Squanto and another American Indian, Samoset, gave the Pilgrims invaluable advice on how to plant maize, and together the English colonists celebrated their first harvest with some ninety Wampanoags in the fall of 1621 to thank God for the bounty and their survival. Colonial Americans continued to hold occasional days of thanksgiving to thank God, and days of prayer and fasting to seek forgiveness. The story of the Pilgrims crossing the Atlantic in the <em data-effect="italics">Mayflower</em> to escape religious persecution and live freely and independently in North America is commemorated each November as Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p id="auto_ec9212e3-5c2d-4b62-a702-c64c8b703b07_fs-idm401230512">In 1630, the Pilgrims were followed by four hundred nonseparatist Puritans who sought, in the words of Governor John Winthrop, to establish a “city upon a hill” at Massachusetts Bay. That beachhead sparked a massive migration of more than fifteen thousand settlers in the next decade.</p>

<p id="auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_fs-idm404676064">In what is now Massachusetts, the period between the Pilgrims’ landing in 1620 and the 1661 death of Massasoit, chief of the Wampanoag confederation, was one of mostly peaceful coexistence between the colonists and the local tribes. The American Indians, however, were suffering. Their population had been decimated by European diseases. Moreover, they had lost tribal lands due to legal sales to the colonists and illegal land grabs, which meant they had less area for hunting and agriculture. It was clear to American Indian leaders that English power was increasing while the power of the Indians was declining (<a href="#auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_BRI_APUSH_02_04_KPhilWar" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_fs-idm379304048">Upon Massasoit’s death, his two sons took control of the Pokanoket tribe within the Wampanoag confederation of Indians. Massasoit’s elder son, Wamsutta (also known as Alexander), died under mysterious circumstances after having been interrogated by Plymouth authorities about rumors that the Pokanokets were amassing muskets and discussing possible warfare. Wamsutta’s brother, Metacom (also known as King Philip), now took control of the Pokanokets. He knew what was coming and had to decide how he would react to the expansion of the English. “I am determined not to live until I have no Country,” he said. An act of violence would be the catalyst for his decision to fight the English.</p>

<p id="auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_fs-idm379277728">Tensions increased further in 1674 when the English accused the Pokanokets of killing one of their interpreters, a Christian Indian named John Sassamon. Sassamon had recently decided to live among the English, and his body was discovered in a pond under the winter ice. His death was thought accidental until another Christian Indian, Patuckson, accused three Pokanokets of murdering Sassamon. An English court of twelve jurors and an auxiliary Indian jury found the three Pokanokets guilty of the murder and hanged them. Just one year later, the situation reached a boiling point when Philip’s warriors, probably without his consent, killed some English cattle in the town of Swansea. The English responded by shooting one of the warriors. The war had begun.</p>

<p id="auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_fs-idm383906032">Wampanoag warriors were quickly joined by warriors of the Nipmuck and many smaller tribes along the Connecticut River. In the opening months of the war, the Indians were highly successful through a combination of raiding English frontier towns, killing hundreds of settlers, and ambushing the English militia. In fact, one of the worst losses suffered by the English was the ambush at Bloody Brook (in South Deerfield, MA), when Indian warriors killed 76 colonists in a lightning-fast strike. They also attacked several towns, including Brookfield and Springfield. After driving off an attacking Indian army, the English sent one hundred American Indian women and children into slavery.</p>

<p id="auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_fs-idm407784960">Meanwhile, the Wampanoag and their allies captured English colonists who, if they survived, might be released in exchange for ransom payments. One such colonist was Mary Rowlandson from Lancaster, who suffered more than two months of captivity. She later chronicled her ordeal in a best-selling book, describing how the band of American Indians who held her was always on the move and hungry (<a href="#auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_BRI_APUSH_02_04_Rowlandson" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Their forced mobility impeded the Indians’ ability to conduct warfare, but they were not able to grow their crops, because the colonists had located many of their villages and burned them to the ground. The American Indians conducted what now is called guerrilla warfare, but being constantly on the move was wearing them down.</p>

<p id="auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_fs-idm381414608">Because the English were losing the war in the opening months, they took a calculated gamble and planned an attack on the powerful Narragansetts. The Narragansetts (living in what is now Rhode Island) were a neutral tribe, but the colonists feared they would soon join King Philip’s warriors and the other hostile tribes. English authorities decided a sneak attack on the Narragansetts was worth the risk, and in December 1675, Massachusetts Bay Colony, Plymouth Colony, Rhode Island, and Connecticut sent one thousand militia to spring an attack on a major Narragansett winter encampment. Between three hundred and six hundred Narragansett warriors and men, women, and children were killed in the assault, as were many of the colonists. The Narragansetts retaliated by raiding several English towns and killing many colonists in the first four months of 1676.</p>

<p id="auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_fs-idm410162304">The attacking English had been assisted by Mohegans, illustrating that not all the Indians of New England were aligned with Philip in the uprising. The inability of the tribes to unite against the English was a major reason the tide of the war shifted in the spring of 1676. Friendly Indians acted as guides for the English, helping prevent the English from walking into ambushes. One English militiaman, Captain Benjamin Church, became very adept at learning from his Indian allies, and he had considerable success killing and capturing hostile American Indians.</p>

<p id="auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_fs-idm381346912">The battle that broke the back of the Indian war effort occurred at modern-day Turners Falls in May 1676. American Indians had used Peskeompskut, a village on the banks of the river, as a place to rest and resupply before setting out on more raids. They must have believed they were relatively safe because the village was north of any sizable English town, so they posted few guards. However, Captain William Turner marched his troops north from the Hadley, Northampton, area and surrounded the village during the night. At dawn, the soldiers attacked, killing many unsuspecting Indians.</p>

<p id="auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_fs-idm404642752">By June 1676, it was clear to the Indians that the English were just too strong in southern New England. Many went north and joined the Abenakis. Others surrendered, only to be either executed or sold into slavery to toil in the sugarcane fields of Bermuda or the Caribbean. King Philip returned to his home grounds at Mount Hope (Bristol, Rhode Island) with a handful of Indians still loyal to him. Perhaps he knew the war was over and wanted to go down fighting in the land he knew best. But his stay at Mount Hope was short. Benjamin Church, using friendly Indians as guides, tracked him down with the help of one of Metacom’s men who betrayed him. Church located Metacom’s camp; a handful of Indians still loyal to Metacom were hiding in the woods alongside their leader. Church positioned his men in a wide circle around the camp, so that if Metacom and his men tried to flee, they would be intercepted by musket fire. Church chronicled in his diary what happened next. When Metacom realized he was discovered, he ran within range of an Englishman and his Indian ally. “They let him come fair within shot,” Church recorded, “and the Englishman’s gun missing fire, he bid the Indian to fire away, and he did so to purpose: sent one musket bullet through his heart, and another not above two inches from it. He fell upon his face in the mud and water, with his gun under him.”</p>

<p id="auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_fs-idm383946912">With Metacom dead and the remaining hostile Indians fleeing to northern New England, the war in Massachusetts and Rhode Island sputtered to an end. It was the costliest war in American history in terms of casualties as a percentage of the population. The American Indians were driven out of their villages in southern New England, but the colonists suffered almost as much: More than half the English settlements were attacked during the war, and many colonists were left homeless. The king of England responded by tightening the reins on New England’s freedom, which the colonists later resisted.</p>

<p id="auto_865085f2-f30f-4d8c-878f-2b8c768d2b4f_fs-idm404983456">Many of the American Indians who survived the war sought their revenge by aligning themselves with the French in Canada. Not long after King Philip’s War ended, the long nightmare of the French and Indian Wars began.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm405622112"><h3 data-type="title">Claim A</h3>
<p id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm400158832">It is easy to assume that settlers in English North America had always felt alienated from Britain and its empire—why else would they have left home to start a new life abroad? But their transition in identity was slower and more complicated than it first appears. Throughout the seventeenth century, when the first permanent colonies were established in America, most settlers’ identities remained stubbornly “English” rather than anything that could meaningfully be called “American.”</p>
<p id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm415255504">English people lived within an intricate structure of ideology, institutions, laws, and customs. The reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) promoted a sense of national pride, especially in opposition to Catholic Spain. By the time of the exploratory voyages to America in the 1580s, most English people were content with the unitary rule of a Protestant queen and her Church of England. Away from the center of government in London, England was governed by a hierarchy of unpaid amateur officials, from justices of the peace down to village churchwardens and constables. This dispersed network of power, where local custom tempered centralized law, was popular and effective. Common law was in any case closely related to custom, rooted in the “ancient constitution” dating back to the Magna Carta (“the Great Charter”) of 1215, which curbed royal excesses.</p>
<p id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm406371600">Most migrants to North America just wanted a better standard of living and were eager to recreate English institutions and cling to English identity. In addition, many returned to England after a few years, either because they had never intended to stay or because their plans went awry. The English Civil War that erupted in 1642 between Parliament and King Charles I prompted one-sixth of the men who had arrived in the colonies over the previous decade to go home to fight. Even those who stayed in America preserved strong emotional ties with England, reinforced through connections of family and friendship lasting many decades. Many settlers, more so in Virginia and Maryland than in Massachusetts, remained loyal to the king. On both sides of the political divide, men were bound to England by trade and property interests, religious affiliations, and sheer nostalgia for what they persisted in calling “the motherland.”</p>
<p id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm410315616">The middle years of the seventeenth century divided loyalties in English America much as they did in England. The anxious desire of colonists to remain culturally English can be seen in petitions to the crown, asserting the political rights of freeborn Englishmen. These petitioners were more volubly English than their brethren at home who took their liberties for granted. Pledges of allegiance to Magna Carta and the ancient constitution became even more explicit when colonists protested the hated Navigation Acts of the mid-1600s. The passage of the acts made Englishmen abroad feel like foreigners, hardening anxieties of no longer being English—at least in the same way that people in England felt English. Yet the Navigation Acts, like all unpopular English legislation, were hard to enforce at a distance of three thousand miles. This created a kind of de facto autonomy in economic life, reinforced by the hard commercial fact that the colonies had raw materials that England had to buy.</p>
<p id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm408646512">Economic assertiveness was bound up with political self-determination. By 1700, local assemblies across English America, legitimately created for day-to-day administration, had grown in confidence. Impositions by the English government only reinforced the sense that it neither understood what life was like in America nor appreciated the sacrifices made by settlers, who saw themselves as “voluntary exiles.” These differences emerged as arguments during Bacon’s Rebellion in Virginia in 1676. For the rest of the seventeenth century, England redoubled its efforts to make its colonies toe the line and was successful in limiting the power of their elected assemblies. And yet by 1700, the power of royal governors clearly depended upon the compliance of prominent colonists, whose power came from having a stake in the land. Governors who behaved like despots achieved little or were deposed. The charters that had given life to American plantations continued to frame colonial affairs, both legally and politically, English political ideology was upheld.</p>
<p id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm405589872">During the French and Indian War, the British fought alongside the American colonists and defended them with a massive war effort. In the wake of the war, the British asked the American colonists, the least taxed in the British empire, to pay a fair share of their defense. They protested the taxes, but most did not object to British regulations in the colonies and simply wanted to return to the status quo before the war. Very few colonists argued for separation before 1776, and most wanted to remain British subjects and retain a British identity. After independence, tens of thousands of Tories fled to the British Empire.</p>

<p id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm412721504">Colonial Americans of the mid-eighteenth century were loyal members of the British empire who paid faithful homage to their king in London. They were also proud of the many liberties they enjoyed and understood that those freedoms had originated in the mother country; however, despite their devotion to their British heritage, Americans felt significantly more pride in the colonies they and their ancestors had established. Indeed, over the generations, they had built more than a dozen flourishing self-governing provinces along the eastern seaboard, where settlers largely directed their own economic, military, social, and political affairs. Without these long-established patterns of self-governance, British Americans would never have embarked upon independence in 1776.</p>
<p id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm410317920">The colonial American perception that they were equal, yet separate, members of the empire developed throughout the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. During these decades, the government in London generally ruled the colonies in a haphazard and inconsistent fashion. For instance, its efforts to regulate colonial trade, beginning with the Navigation Acts of the mid-1600s, generally failed due to erratic and irregular enforcement. Attempts to achieve political domination over particular colonies, such as James II’s Dominion of New England of 1686, foundered almost immediately in the face of widespread colonial resistance. During the reigns of the eighteenth-century Hanoverian monarchs, royal ministries generally ignored the colonies and looked upon them simply as sources of patronage offices, which officials used to consolidate power at home.</p>
<p id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm404339840">The colonies, meanwhile, developed at a rapid pace during these years. With abundant land, rich natural resources, low taxes, and a large, active middle class, British Americans became accustomed to directing their own economic, military, and political affairs, especially after 1700. In fact, they looked upon local control and self-governance as important freedoms. Colonists established, for instance, many economic practices that gave them a large degree of financial control within their colonies and communities. Provincial governments periodically printed their own currencies, owing to the virtual absence of money in the New World. Recognizing the damage this did to economic development, Virginia sanctioned the use of tobacco as legal money, while Massachusetts leaders issued paper bonds against future revenues as circulating currency. The British government tried to halt or limit these practices, but its attempts usually failed when colonial governors found themselves unable to enforce restrictions in the face of American anger. Colonists also became increasingly proficient at manufacturing locally or in their homes such basic necessities as wool and leather textiles, iron tools, and weapons, including firearms. Several seaport towns, moreover, established thriving shipbuilding yards where, because of abundant American timber, merchant ships were constructed 60 percent less expensively than in England.</p>
<p id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm406699184">Provincial governments (except for Quaker-run Pennsylvania) also organized their own military defenses to expand and protect their communities from hostile Indians as well as rival French and Spanish settlers. Before the French and Indian War, the London government typically refused to send expensive professional armies to North America. The king’s government instead relied upon colonial volunteers to fight and colonial assemblies to pay for imperial defense in the New World. British Americans knew full well that they provided for their own defense, albeit under the English flag (and, after 1707, under the Union Jack). Here too, however, Americans concluded that defending their homes, families, and communities was a fundamental responsibility of a free people.</p>
<p id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm408577232">Elected representative assemblies also exercised increasingly independent powers governing American colonies, especially in the decades before the Revolution. Filled with local leaders chosen by a broad spectrum of the white male population, these legislative assemblies controlled the public purse in terms of setting their colonies’ taxes and determining expenditures. They claimed the same rights and privileges as Britain’s Parliament, and most successfully assumed a number of executive responsibilities, particularly the appointment of colonial officials such as tax collectors, militia officers, and public printers.</p>
<p id="auto_74a2a32a-1523-4b0c-949d-d92a150b8b3a_fs-idm416292928">Beyond robust governing institutions, the colonists’ habit of directing their own affairs also shaped religious life in North America. After the Glorious Revolution removed Catholicism as a serious threat, British Americans became increasingly vocal in expressing dissatisfaction with their established Protestant churches, which many viewed as staid and uninspiring. This eventually led to the First Great Awakening. As large, powerful revivals swept the eastern seaboard from 1720 to 1760, hundreds of previously united Protestant congregations split between emotional and evangelical “New Lights” and more traditional “Old Lights.” The Great Awakening was not a rejection of established authority (as some have asserted), but rather it pointed to the fact that pre-Revolutionary Americans expected—and often demanded—the right to choose the authority to which they would submit.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_9eb25d9f-b234-44fe-80bb-bf1309d9a1fe_fs-idm394017152"><h3 data-type="title">Claim A</h3>
<p id="auto_9eb25d9f-b234-44fe-80bb-bf1309d9a1fe_fs-idm406663040">Some scholars have argued that the “Great Awakening” never happened, but rather was invented by evangelical historians in the nineteenth century. In 1982, a modern historian, Jon Butler, argued that some writers had exaggerated the cohesion and influence of the eighteenth-century revivals, which had been regional, short-lived, theologically diverse, and of limited importance. Above all, according to Butler, the revivals did not lead to the American Revolution. Although Butler’s argument challenged historians to think more carefully about the nature of these revivals, his notion that the Great Awakening was a fiction is not supported by the evidence. When considered in a larger chronological and geographic framework, it becomes clear that eighteenth-century revivals were interconnected, inclusive of several denominations, and long lasting. A closer look shows that these revivals had the potential to be radical and posed a strong challenge to the existing social order. Although the Great Awakening hardly caused the American Revolution, it helped to prepare colonists for a revolutionary movement against the British, because of the struggle for religious liberty by dissenters. Most importantly, the Great Awakening gave birth to the American evangelical movement, a development of enormous consequence in American life.</p>
<p id="auto_9eb25d9f-b234-44fe-80bb-bf1309d9a1fe_fs-idm394709552">It is true that people in the mid-1700s did not call the revivals The Great Awakening, but they did recognize that a significant event had transpired in the “late revival of religion.” The revivals of the eighteenth century can be called an awakening because even as they waned in one region, they spread throughout others. What began in New England and the middle colonies in the 1740s continued through the southern colonies in the 1750s, and revivals continued to regularly occur regionally through the end of the American Revolution. These revivals involved a wide range of denominations, including Anglicans, Congregationalists, Baptists, Methodists, and Moravians. Even though they were spread out over distance and time, they were profoundly interconnected, not only by itinerant preachers (especially George Whitefield) who traveled far and wide, but also through a robust religious print culture, which spread news of revival throughout the colonies.</p>
<p id="auto_9eb25d9f-b234-44fe-80bb-bf1309d9a1fe_fs-idm406731472">The revivals can also be called “great” because they affected so many people in the colonies and because they often contained seeds of religious, political, and social equality. The more radical among the evangelical revivalists gave leadership roles to a surprising number of women and nonwhites. For example, women engaged in public speaking and exhorted groups of men and women to convert. This role for women had little parallel elsewhere in colonial America. Although white evangelicals held out an ambiguous message to African Americans—some speaking against slavery and others affirming it—the revivals contributed to the beginning of the nearly wholesale conversion of African Americans to some form of evangelical Christianity. Among the Indians and African Americans who underwent evangelical conversion were the Mohegan pastor Samson Occom and the poet Phillis Wheatley.</p>
<p id="auto_9eb25d9f-b234-44fe-80bb-bf1309d9a1fe_fs-idm383561696">The revivals were also “great” in the significant challenge they posed to the existing religious and political hierarchy. The debates that raged over revival were, in part, debates over order. Revivalists also undermined the relationship between church and state by speaking against the official churches. For example, when Presbyterian minister Gilbert Tennent called for true Christians to leave behind their ministers and join the dissenting church, he was challenging the monopoly of the established church. More than anything, the revivals threatened the power of the established churches as Congregational and Anglican ministers denounced the new, dissenting denominations. This led to a split between the pro-revival “New Lights” and conservative “Old Lights.”</p>
<p id="auto_9eb25d9f-b234-44fe-80bb-bf1309d9a1fe_fs-idm402048912">Most significantly, the revivals were “great” to the extent that they created the American evangelical movement. In particular, the eighteenth-century revivals led religious dissenters such as the Baptists and Methodists to challenge the authority of the established churches in several states and thus set the stage for the flowering of religious liberty. Many evangelicals were pivotal in bringing about the end of American religious establishment, such as Virginia’s Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, authored by Thomas Jefferson and adopted in 1786 as a critical precedent for the natural right of freedom of conscience. The evangelical ethos of civil and religious liberty clearly contributed to the rhetoric and ideology of the Revolutionary movement.</p>

<p id="auto_9eb25d9f-b234-44fe-80bb-bf1309d9a1fe_fs-idm406693872">Evangelicals in colonial America had long hoped for an extraordinary outpouring of God’s grace akin to that of the Day of Pentecost, described in the Bible as a great outpouring of God’s Spirit. They found the mighty “Work of God” they were looking for when large, enthusiastic crowds began attending preaching services during the revivals of 1740–1745. But they selected and arranged the facts into a story, and thus they set about fabricating the “Great Awakening.” However, not all Americans were convinced that the revivalists’ narrative reflected a factual rendering of events. Although revival leaders concluded that the evidence added up to a “great and general awakening,” an equally vociferous group contended that the revivals were only scattered, local events not uncommon among Protestants, and that they amounted only to a “small Thing.” These critics believed that the so-called Great Awakening was attended by more “Noise” than substance and that the narrative was the overblown creation of self-promoting enthusiasts.</p>
<p id="auto_9eb25d9f-b234-44fe-80bb-bf1309d9a1fe_fs-idm402706816">An important moment in the fabrication of the Great Awakening occurred in 1754, with the publication of the first history of the revivals. Written by John Gillies, a Scottish evangelical and historian, the <em data-effect="italics">Historical Collections Relating to Remarkable Periods of the Gospel</em> proclaimed that the “general and great awakenings” were both extensive and extraordinary. Gillies explained his editorial method as one of piecing together accounts of local revivals into a coherent whole. He wrote in the preface, “When similar facts, that were so dispersed, and sometimes mixed with other subjects in different books . . . are now united, [and] laid before the reader in one view, . . . they may be read and compared with much greater advantage.” The facts that he collected had already been arranged to tell the desired story of a unified great awakening. In 1743, Thomas Prince, a Boston revival supporter and publisher, had solicited from like-minded ministers particular accounts of “the most remarkable Instances of the Power and Grace of God.” He provided an outline of the script that he sought, which emphasized the extraordinary nature of the revivals, including the size of crowds, the number of converts, and the nature of conversion experiences. As a result, when Prince received the almost two dozen narratives of local revivals, they bore a striking similarity, one to the other. It is not surprising that, when Gillies arranged his facts, they fit together and suggested a cohesive movement.</p>
<p id="auto_9eb25d9f-b234-44fe-80bb-bf1309d9a1fe_fs-idm356167504">Opponents insisted that the facts did not add up to a “great and extensive awakening.” One outspoken critic, Reverend Charles Chauncy of Boston, asserted that the extent of the revivals had been exaggerated by loud rhetoric and “romantick Representations.” He claimed that the much-publicized local revivals gave the impression of a movement much larger than the evidence supported, noting that only one in four New England congregations participated in the revivals. Furthermore, Chauncy argued, the awakening was not “great” if measured by the changes it wrought, asserting that followers of the revivals did not live more moral lives or show greater devotion to God: “Tis not evident to me, that Persons, generally have a better Understanding of Religion, a better Government of their Passions, a more Christian Love to their Neighbour, or that they are more decent and regular in their Devotions towards God.”</p>
<p id="auto_9eb25d9f-b234-44fe-80bb-bf1309d9a1fe_fs-idm389651040">The Great Awakening as a historical fabrication assumed its final form in 1841 with the publication of Joseph Tracy’s <em data-effect="italics">The Great Awakening: A History of the Revival of Religion in the Time of Edwards and Whitefield.</em> Tracy, an historian and evangelical, wrote his account to inspire other evangelicals of his day to work for and expect a glorious revival that would rival the documented awakening of one hundred years earlier. Tracy’s work continues to define how Americans discuss the eighteenth-century revivals. Nonetheless, the Great Awakening has found a permanent place in American religious history and continues to evoke profound disagreements over its meaning and even its reality.</p>

<p id="auto_02072e90-832f-4aea-908d-cde3bc69a335_fs-idm409099232">In April 1630, a fleet of four ships set sail for New England carrying four hundred settlers bound for the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Most were Puritans who traveled to North America to establish a godly society and a pure church free of what they considered corruptions in the Church of England. At some point before, during, or after the voyage, John Winthrop, their governor, delivered a sermon entitled, “A Model of Christian Charity,” for the settlers. Winthrop referred often to Scripture in creating the Puritan religious, political, and social covenant, or agreement. The most important covenant the settlers formed with God was to set an example of piety and virtue in their purified church. The political and social dimensions of the covenant would bind society together with mutual cooperation and obedience to the laws for the public good. “A Model of Christian Charity” is most famous for its assertion that the new colony would be “a city upon a hill,” a phrase which has been seized upon by politicians promoting a more secularized representation of America as a beacon of liberty and self-government for the world.</p>

We must uphold a familiar commerce together in all meekness, gentleness, patience and liberality. We must delight in each other; make other's conditions our own; rejoice together, mourn together, labor and suffer together, always having before our eyes our commission and community in the work, as members of the same body.

<p id="auto_ad80870f-4f75-444e-b3b7-4264a176267e_fs-idm385452864">In 1675, the Virginia colony was experiencing a great deal of tension between settlers and American Indians. Both sides engaged in fighting and retaliatory raids along the frontier because of disputed lands. Meanwhile, the colony was experiencing internal turmoil over increasing taxes, falling tobacco prices, increasing pressures to open more land for settlement, and growing questions over suspected corruption by long-term royal governor Sir William Berkeley. A recent wealthy migrant to the colony, Nathaniel Bacon, sat on the royal council. Bacon became a champion for the landless and poor when he urged the governor to send more armies against the American Indians. The colony split into factions supporting Bacon or Berkeley, who wished to avoid conflict with the American Indians in favor of stability and peace. Events soon descended into civil war: Rival armies fought each other and the capital, Jamestown, was burned. Order was only restored with the death of Bacon, the suppression of the rebellion, and the arrival of English troops.</p>

<li>How is Penn’s description of the colony at odds with the description offered by the Germantown Friends (Quakers)?</li>
<li>Both sources are in the form of a letter but are used for different purposes. How does their intended audience for each letter affect what the author says?</li>

<p id="auto_3cc16652-b7b9-4d1c-8b12-c258fd3c9d06_fs-idm393134752">English colonies were generally funded by joint-stock companies in which investors took significant risks but could reap great rewards. For more than a century, to induce investment and settlement, English sponsors and organizers of colonies wrote promotional literature with extravagant claims about settling in the New World. William Penn helped establish the Pennsylvania colony and acted as its governor. He understood that the success of his colony depended on a steady stream of settlers and financial support. In 1681, Penn encouraged the creation of The Free Society of Traders, a joint-stock company founded by a small group of Quakers in England. The members of this company were given concessions or privileges such as large tracts of land and seats on the Provincial Council in Philadelphia in return for their financial support of Penn’s colony. In this letter to The Free Society of Traders, Penn described Pennsylvania in glowing terms to encourage immigration and assure his investors they made a wise investment in his colony.</p>

<p id="auto_740a7281-804f-4927-b6d7-7aa6d2fdb6ec_fs-idm386433392">One of William Penn’s motives in establishing Pennsylvania was to provide a refuge for persecuted groups such as the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, as they were commonly known. Many Quakers became opponents of slavery because they believed in the equality of all men and women. A young German Quaker of the Germantown Friends drafted an antislavery petition, which was signed by three others living in Germantown (now part of Philadelphia) seven years after Pennsylvania’s founding. The document was intended to raise the issue of slavery as a matter of concern at an upcoming Quaker meeting in the nearby town of Dublin. In his argument against the evils of slavery, the author referenced the Bible to support the natural liberty of all humans and argued that slave owning in Pennsylvania hurt the colony’s reputation in Europe, thereby discouraging additional settlement to the colony.</p>

Viz., to be sold or made a slave for all the time of his life? . . .</a> There is a saying, that we shall doe to all men like as we will be done ourselves; making no difference of what generation, descent or colour they are. And those who steal or robb men, and those who buy or purchase them, are they not all alike? <a href="#auto_740a7281-804f-4927-b6d7-7aa6d2fdb6ec_fs-idm260357504">Here is liberty of <strong data-effect="bold">conscience</strong>, which is right and reasonable; here ought to be likewise liberty of the body,</a> except of evil-doers, which is another case. <a href="#auto_740a7281-804f-4927-b6d7-7aa6d2fdb6ec_fs-idm258686624">But to bring men hither, or to rob and sell them against their will, we stand against. In Europe there are many oppressed for conscience sake; and here there are those oppressed which are of a black colour.</a> And we who know that men must not commit adultery,—<a href="#auto_740a7281-804f-4927-b6d7-7aa6d2fdb6ec_fs-idm260880448">some do commit adultery, in others, separating wives from their husbands and giving them to others;</a> and some sell the children of these poor creatures to other men. Ah! Doe consider well this thing, you who doe it, if you would be done at this manner? And if it is done according to Christianity? You surpass Holland and Germany in this thing. <a href="#auto_740a7281-804f-4927-b6d7-7aa6d2fdb6ec_fs-idm237747440">This makes an ill report in all those countries of Europe, where they hear off, that Quakers doe here handle men as they handle their cattle. And for that reason some have no mind or inclination to come hither.</a> . . . Pray, what thing in the world can be done worse towards us, than if men should rob or steal us away, and sell us for slaves to strange countries; separating housbands from their wives and children. Being now this is not done in the manner we would be done at therefore we contradict and are against this traffic of men-body. And <a href="#auto_740a7281-804f-4927-b6d7-7aa6d2fdb6ec_fs-idm274907904">we who profess that it is not lawful to steal, must, likewise, avoid to purchase such things as are stolen, but rather help to stop this robbing and stealing if possible. And such men ought to be delivered out of the hands of the robbers, and set free as well as in Europe. Then is Pennsylvania to have a good report, instead it hath now a bad one for this sake in other countries.</a> Especially whereas the Europeans are desirous to know in what manner the Quakers doe rule in their province;—and most of them doe look upon us with an envious eye. But if this is done well, what shall we say is done evil? . . .</td>

<p id="auto_b588cf6c-ace2-41de-8917-5b28011a2514_fs-idm413522320">In 1753, the French were building forts around the Ohio River Valley to take firm possession of that territory against any expansion by the English. Virginia governor Robert A. Dinwiddie dispatched twenty-one-year-old George Washington to deliver a message to the French asserting Britain’s territorial claims. During his lengthy journey to modern-day Pittsburgh and beyond, he had many adventures on the frontier and was deeply involved with the events and imperial conflict that would lead to the French and Indian War less than a year later.</p>

<p id="auto_50fde56b-cf1e-41d6-94fb-9e26161a90d7_fs-idm409459536">Major advances in cartography took place during the European Age of Exploration in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The printing press made maps more widely available, and a renewed emphasis on geometry made them much more accurate in conveying physical features. Despite these advances, maps were still expensive, and settlers typically had to rely on the mother country to print and sell them. Explorers and colonizers needed maps, and some created their own as they explored new lands. Maps from the early colonial era outlined more than physical features of the land—they played an essential role in the encounters and struggles between Europeans and American Indians, as well as the clashing of European empires. As you examine these maps, think about how they reflect changes and continuities in English colonial claims from 1624 to 1755.</p>

<li>Based on your review of excerpts of these four charters, what rights do you believe are included in the phrase, “traditional rights of Englishmen”?</li>
<li>Based on your study of these excerpts, to what extent, if at all, do the most prevalent constitutional themes seem to change over time?</li>
<li>Give specific examples of ideas related to democracy, freedom, and individualism in the charters.</li>
<li>What cultural values and political institutions at this early time in the English colonies contributed to the development of an American identity?</li>
<li>To what extent do these documents foreshadow protections with which you are familiar in the twenty-first century?</li>

<ul id="auto_600abafa-307c-493b-9492-9468f8c1383d_fs-idm354886400">
<li>Step 1: You are twelve years old, and you love to read. However, books are very expensive and difficult to find where you live, so your father signs you up for an apprenticeship in a business that will give you much better access to books, newspapers, and magazines.</li>
<li>Step 2: You will receive free room and board in your new job, and you will live with your boss.</li>
<li>Step 3: You are committed by contract to work in this job for nine years.</li>
<li>Step 4: Although your boss will cover all your expenses for the term of the contract, you will only receive wages for the ninth year. In return, you will receive training so that you will be able to start your own business.</li>
<li>Step 5: The boss is your older brother.</li>

Conduct a brief discussion in which you ask those who were willing to take the job in step 1, but were no longer interested after step 5, at which step they would have declined the opportunity. Then, explain that these are the terms of apprenticeship in which Benjamin Franklin’s father arranged for him to work in the printing shop of his older brother, James, in 1718. Note also that these were considered generous terms for an apprentice at the time, and most working-class boys were expected to begin an apprenticeship to learn a trade in this manner by the time they were fourteen years old.</p>

<p id="auto_afdd8acd-d137-4e21-9532-2805179679bd_fs-idm407183920">Ask students to turn to one another in small groups and develop a response to this question: What kind of government does the United States have? After giving students a few minutes to discuss the question, call for their responses and write on the board a few key concepts that they mention. Because democracy and republic are often used interchangeably and many students may say the United States is a democracy, this will be an ideal time to direct students’ attention to the important differences between the terms, emphasizing that the United States is a republic. <strong data-effect="bold">Distribute the Handout B: Principles and Virtues Glossary</strong> and <strong data-effect="bold">Handout A: The Colonial Origins of American Republicanism Student Packet.</strong> Have students focus on the definitions of <strong data-effect="bold">democracy</strong> and <strong data-effect="bold">republic</strong> on the first page of the glossary and ask: “How would you know if your government demonstrates republicanism?” Answers should reflect student understanding that, to demonstrate republicanism, the government must be based on the idea that legitimate power comes from the people themselves (popular sovereignty and consent), and they freely elect representatives to make and carry out the laws.</p>
<p id="auto_afdd8acd-d137-4e21-9532-2805179679bd_fs-idm402554896">After the focus on republicanism in the warm-up activity, you might direct student attention to specific principles such as equality, consent, liberty, private property, freedom of religion. This will be helpful background especially if this is the first time your students have addressed constitutional principles. Use <strong data-effect="bold">Handout C: Principles and Virtues Graphic Organizer</strong> to help students come up with examples of these principles.</p>
<p id="auto_afdd8acd-d137-4e21-9532-2805179679bd_fs-idm403760816">Write in the board in large letters: Republicanism. Tell students that in this lesson they will examine some of the influences that contributed to the development of republicanism in the American colonies. Write on the board (see diagram) the terms, English tradition of constitutional self-government, arguments for freedom of conscience, and Early American Enlightenment, to keep them in front of students throughout the lesson.</p>

<p id="auto_afdd8acd-d137-4e21-9532-2805179679bd_fs-idm407895584">1. Have students turn their attention to <strong data-effect="bold">Handout A: The Colonial Origins of American Republicanism Student Packet.</strong> Assign the background and primary source readings to students. Assign the readings as best fits your teaching situation (small groups, jigsaw, and so forth). Depending on your students’ background, you may wish to walk students through the Mayflower Compact page as a whole class, modeling a think-aloud strategy to answer the questions provided and to identify the principles reflected in the Compact.</p>
<p id="auto_afdd8acd-d137-4e21-9532-2805179679bd_fs-idm406010800">2. Instruct students to discuss and annotate the assigned passages according to the directions provided on the handout, to show where and how the documents reflect constitutional principles and help them develop an answer to the guiding question: <strong data-effect="bold">How did the English tradition of constitutional self-government, arguments for freedom of conscience, and the early American Enlightenment contribute to republicanism in the American colonies?</strong></p>

<p id="auto_afdd8acd-d137-4e21-9532-2805179679bd_fs-idm404876272">1. Depending on the method you used to have students do the initial reading and analysis, conduct a discussion that allows students to consider all the documents. They may share their responses as a whole class, in the second stage of jigsaw groups, through inner/outer circle discussion, Socratic activities, and so forth. See <strong data-effect="bold">Handout D: Using the Inner and Outer Circle Discussion Technique</strong> for suggested guidelines on this discussion method.</p>
<p id="auto_afdd8acd-d137-4e21-9532-2805179679bd_fs-idm383896000">2. Draw students’ attention back to the Republicanism graphic on the board and discuss the following:</p>
<ol id="auto_afdd8acd-d137-4e21-9532-2805179679bd_fs-idm406418976" type="a">
<li>“To what extent did the English tradition of constitutional self-government, arguments for freedom of conscience, and the early American Enlightenment contribute to republicanism in the American colonies?” (They can use their three-color coding of the handout to help compose an answer and justification for their response.)</li>
<li>Scholars generally assert that the American Enlightenment began in the 1700s. Is there any evidence in these documents to suggest it began earlier? Explain.</li>
<li>Did natural law exist before the philosophes in France began to write about it?</li>
</ol>

<p id="auto_ef437dd4-f272-416b-b4b7-3a84938d6c5d_fs-idm394404640">1. Students will read through the <strong data-effect="bold">Handout A: Long Essay Rubric</strong>, focusing on the thesis and evidence points. Students should highlight in one color the area of the rubric about which they feel most confident and highlight in a second color the area of the rubric about which they feel the least confident.</p>
<p id="auto_ef437dd4-f272-416b-b4b7-3a84938d6c5d_fs-idm396318400">2. The teacher will lead a discussion on student questions about the AP Long Essay Rubric. Assure students that the rubric is a tool not only for the reader who will score their exam in May but also for the student, who can use it as a checklist to ensure their essay addresses as many aspects of the rubric as possible. In this outline, they will focus on writing a strong comparative thesis statement that is supported by specific and relevant evidence.</p>

<p id="auto_ef437dd4-f272-416b-b4b7-3a84938d6c5d_fs-idm402896448">1. Two student volunteers should read aloud the two options on <strong data-effect="bold">Handout B: Long Essay Options and Outline</strong> for the essay questions.</p>
<p id="auto_ef437dd4-f272-416b-b4b7-3a84938d6c5d_fs-idm388011696">2. Each student should select option A or B to answer and outline a response to the chosen question. Students can be provided <strong data-effect="bold">Handout E: Comparative Thesis Statements and Sentence Stems</strong> for extra support in crafting sentences.</p>
</section>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_ef437dd4-f272-416b-b4b7-3a84938d6c5d_fs-idm399447008"><h3 data-type="title">III. Application</h3>
<p id="auto_ef437dd4-f272-416b-b4b7-3a84938d6c5d_fs-idm370122224">1. Students should share their written outlines with a partner. At this time, students should not discuss or clarify their outlines but rather allow their partner to provide them feedback on <strong data-effect="bold">Handout C: Peer Feedback</strong> using the Praise, Polish, and Pose method.</p>
<ol id="auto_ef437dd4-f272-416b-b4b7-3a84938d6c5d_fs-idm402569888" type="a">
<li>Praise: Offer at least one piece of positive feedback. What was done well?</li>
<li>Polish: Offer at least one piece of constructive feedback. How can the essay be improved?</li>
<li>Pose: Ask your partner a clarifying or probing question. What are you confused by, or what do you want to know more about?</li>
</ol>
<p id="auto_ef437dd4-f272-416b-b4b7-3a84938d6c5d_fs-idm383561696">3. Next, students should discuss their Praise, Polish, and Pose feedback with their partner in a “mini conference.” Students should focus on each outline, one at a time, spending approximately three minutes per outline. Students should have the opportunity to respond to their partner’s feedback or record any information necessary to improve their work.</p>
<p id="auto_ef437dd4-f272-416b-b4b7-3a84938d6c5d_fs-idm395817104">4. Students will then create an action plan for their individual outline, noting two or three specific steps they will take to improve it, based on their peer’s feedback and the AP Rubric.</p>

<p id="auto_ef437dd4-f272-416b-b4b7-3a84938d6c5d_fs-idm347442176">1. After the teacher has had the opportunity to evaluate student outlines based on the rubric, students should be provided the opportunity to reflect on their writing progress and set intentional goals for growth, using <strong data-effect="bold">Handout D: Writing Reflection</strong>.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm223361680">When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm216040368">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. —That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, —That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. —Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm221526464">He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm235656464">He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm224843632">He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm220586768">He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm244966528">He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm237837296">He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm232604640">He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm229014000">He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm214397728">He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm236314736">He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm217446896">He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm237550720">He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm246755136">He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm216526512">For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm221788272">For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm216004848">For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm234915616">For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm232000432">For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm241174048">For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm238234736">For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm234357904">For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm234901968">For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm224084192">He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm219576688">He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm238210048">He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm235067200">He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm252585616">He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm233742736">In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm213672448">Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</p>

<p id="auto_3ff09ed8-404c-4b72-b8b2-eedd3f174b0a_fs-idm241290112">We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>
