			<p id="auto_e634f49f-4834-4617-8a9a-eb3378bac700_fs-idm331867600">The American legal system has its roots in the British legal system. It was developed with the purpose of establishing standards for acceptable conduct, proscribing punishment for violations as a deterrent, establishing systems for enforcement, and peacefully resolving disputes. The ultimate goal of the American legal system is promotion of the common good.</p>

			<section data-depth="1" id="auto_e634f49f-4834-4617-8a9a-eb3378bac700_fs-idm333845552"><h3 data-type="title" class="Heading-2">Establishing Standards</h3>
			<p id="auto_e634f49f-4834-4617-8a9a-eb3378bac700_fs-idm348679920">The American legal system was developed with the goal of establishing a set of standards that outline what is to be considered minimally acceptable behavior. Broadly speaking, federal laws are those that all United States citizens are expected to follow. State and local laws may often be similar to federal laws, but they may also differ quite a bit, and only govern the state’s citizens.</p>

			<p id="auto_e634f49f-4834-4617-8a9a-eb3378bac700_fs-idm342611984">The American legal system follows the British Common Law system, which is designed to leverage past judicial reasoning, while also promoting fairness through consistency. Judges in the Common Law system help shape the law through their rulings and interpretations. This body of past decisions is known as <span data-type="term">case law</span>. Judges use case law to inform their own rulings. Indeed, judges rely on <span data-type="term">precedent</span>, i.e., previous court rulings on similar cases, for ruling on their own cases.</p>
			<p id="auto_e634f49f-4834-4617-8a9a-eb3378bac700_fs-idm331224912">All U.S. states, except Louisiana, have enacted “reception statutes,” stating that the judge-made common law of England is the law of the state to the extent that it does not conflict with the state’s current laws.</p>
			<p id="auto_e634f49f-4834-4617-8a9a-eb3378bac700_fs-idm355924592">However, the body of American law is now so robust that American cases rarely cite English materials, except for a British classic or a famous old case. Additionally, foreign law is not cited as binding precedent. Therefore, the current American practice of the common law tradition refers more to the process of judges looking to the precedent set jurisdictionally, and substantially similar to, American case law.</p>

			<p id="auto_e634f49f-4834-4617-8a9a-eb3378bac700_fs-idm333925664">Congruent with the goal of establishing standards and promoting consistency, laws are also used to promote, provide, and maintain order.</p>

			<p id="auto_e634f49f-4834-4617-8a9a-eb3378bac700_fs-idm340546224">Conflicts are to be expected given people’s varying needs, desires, objectives, values systems, and perspectives. The American legal system provides a formal means for resolving conflicts through the courts. In addition to the federal court and individual state systems, there are also several informal means for resolving disputes that are collectively called alternative dispute resolution (ADR). Examples of these are mediation and arbitration.</p>

			<p id="auto_e634f49f-4834-4617-8a9a-eb3378bac700_fs-idm351019200">The United States Constitution and state laws provide people with many liberties and rights. American laws operate with the purpose and function of protecting these liberties and rights from violations by persons, companies, governments, or other entities.</p>
			<p id="auto_e634f49f-4834-4617-8a9a-eb3378bac700_fs-idm336752272">Based on the British legal system, the American legal system is divided into a federal system and a state and local system. The overall goal of both systems is to provide order and a means of dispute settlement, as well as to protect citizens’ rights.</p>
			<p id="auto_e634f49f-4834-4617-8a9a-eb3378bac700_fs-idm355461200">Clearly, the purposes of the American legal system are broad and well-considered.</p>

<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm336162048">The American legal system is made up of many types of codified forms of law, with the United States Constitution being the pre-eminent source of American law. The Constitution establishes the boundaries of federal law, and it must be followed by all citizens, organizations, and entities. It includes Congressional acts, Senate-ratified treaties, executive regulations, and federal case law. The United States Code (“USC”) compiles these laws.</p>

<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm348748432">American law mainly originates from constitutional law, statutory law, treaties, administrative regulations, and common law (which includes case law).</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm355083840"><h3 data-type="title" class="Heading-2 ParaOverride-5">The Constitution</h3>
<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm342387088">The United States Constitution is the foremost law of the land. The Constitution’s first ten amendments are referred to as the Bill of Rights, which offers specific protections of individual liberty and justice. Additionally, the Bill of Rights restricts certain powers of government. The Constitution empowers federal law making by giving Congress the power to enact statutes for certain limited purposes, like regulating interstate commerce. The United States Code officially compiles and codifies the federal statutes.</p>

<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm354212848">As discussed in the previous section, the United States follows the common law legal tradition of English law. Judges in the Common Law system help shape the law through their rulings and interpretations. This body of past decisions is known as <span data-type="term">case law</span>, which is used by judges to inform their own rulings. In fact, judges rely on <span data-type="term">precedent</span>, i.e., previous court rulings on similar cases, when determining the ruling in their own cases.</p>
<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm343956720">An example of how case law works is the case of the <em data-effect="italics"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">State v. Wayfair Inc.</span></em> (2017 SD 56, 901 N.W.2d 754 (S.D. 2017), cert. granted, 138 S. Ct. 735 (2018)), in which the South Dakota Supreme Court held that a state law requiring internet retailers without an in-state physical presence to remit sales tax was unconstitutional. Unless this ruling is overruled by the United States Supreme Court, then it becomes part of the case law and precedent set in that state, and it will be followed by subsequent rulings when similar cases are filed.</p></section>

<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm343327424">The Constitution empowers federal law making by giving Congress the power to enact statutes for certain limited purposes, like regulating interstate commerce. Federal law preempts conflicting state and local laws. However, federal preemption is not without limits, insofar as states each have their own constitution and are considered sovereign. Therefore, federal law may only preempt state law if it is enacted within the limited powers that are enumerated and granted to Congress in the Constitution.</p>
<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm342752448">Broad interpretations of the Constitution’s Commerce and Spending Clauses have expanded the reach of federal law into many areas. Indeed, its reach in some areas, such as aviation and railroads, is now so broad that it preempts virtually all state law. In other areas, such as family law, lawmaking continues to be left to the states. Finally, a number of powerful federal and state laws coexist in areas such as antitrust, trademark, employment law, and others.</p>

<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm336824224">When a bill becomes a federal law, it is assigned a law number and prepared for publication by the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Public laws are also given legal statutory citation by the OFR and are incorporated into the United States Code (USC).</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm343658896"><h3 data-type="title" class="Heading-2 ParaOverride-5">Regulations</h3>
<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm340462864">Laws differ from regulations in that laws are passed by either the U.S. Congress or state congresses. Regulations, by contrast, are standards and rules adopted by administrative agencies that govern how laws will be enforced.</p>
<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm345186800">Federal agencies often enjoy broad rulemaking authority when Congress acts to grant them this power. Called “regulations,” these agency rules normally carry the force of law, as long as they demonstrate a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established regulations for businesses and their emission and disposal of pollutants to protect the environment. The EPA has the authority to enforce these regulations when a business violates them, and such enforcement is usually done by fining the company or by using other means.</p>
<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm335534544">The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) enables the adoption of regulations, which are codified and incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Federal agencies frequently draft and distribute forms, manuals, policy statements, letters, and rulings. Though these may be considered as persuasive authority by the courts, they do not carry the same force as law. In other words, if a person or business questions a regulation of a government agency, saying it is unconstitutional, and that party is successful in proving it, then the regulation is not enforced and the agency will need to revise it or remove it.</p>

<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm331785648">America, as diverse as its fifty states, is also governed by fifty different state constitutions, state governments, and state courts. Each has its own legislative, executive, and judicial branches. States are empowered to create legislation that is related to matters not preempted by the federal Constitution and federal laws. Most cases involve state law issues and are litigated in state courts.</p>

<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm353139856">In addition to federal and state law, municipalities, towns or cities, and counties may enact their own laws that do not conflict with state or federal laws.</p>
<p id="auto_aab1204a-bb71-48a0-8056-005385057e27_fs-idm331384752">As demonstrated, American law does not draw from one source alone; instead, it is derived from many sources.</p>

  </figure><p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm354680368">As noted, business law touches upon a number of other legal areas, practices, and concerns. Some of the most important of these, which are discussed in this section, are disputes and dispute settlement, business ethics and social responsibility, business and the United States Constitution, criminal liability, torts, contracts, labor and employment law, Unfair Trade Practices and the Federal Trade Commission, international law, and securities regulation. Though they are discussed in much more depth in later chapters, the following gives a brief overview.</p>

  <section data-depth="1" id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm354086624"><h3 data-type="title" class="Heading-2 ParaOverride-5">Disputes and Dispute Settlement</h3>
  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm340136880">In addition to the federal court and individual state systems, there are also a variety of mechanisms that companies can use to resolve disputes. They are collectively called alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”), and they include mediation, settlement, and arbitration. Many states now require companies to resolve legal disputes using ADR before the initiation of any lawsuit to encourage speedy resolution, cost and time containment, and reduced judicial dockets. Traditional litigation remains an option in most cases if other efforts fail or are refused.</p>

  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm336571040">In the routine course of business, employees are often required to make decisions. Business ethics outline the ethical model, or framework, that companies expect employees to follow when making these decisions, as well as the behavior that the companies deem acceptable. Sound and ethical decision making can also help companies avoid legal liability and exposure. Typically, an ethics code and/or a code of conduct details a company’s requirements and guidelines, while also serving as a key corporate governance tool.</p>
  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm331511392">In addition to business ethics, companies must also consider their social responsibility and the laws related to it, such as consumer and investor protections, environmental ethics, marketing ethics, and ethical issues in financial management.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm336627616"><h3 data-type="title" class="Heading-2 ParaOverride-5">Business and the United States Constitution</h3>
  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm350757856">Since the start of the 20th century, broad interpretations of the Constitution’s Commerce and Spending Clauses have expanded the reach of federal law into many areas. Indeed, its reach in some areas is now so broad that it preempts virtually all state law. Thus, the Constitution’s Commerce Clause has been interpreted to allow federal lawmaking and enforcement that applies to many aspects of business activity. Additionally, the Constitution’s Bill of Rights extends some protections to business entities that are also constitutionally guaranteed to individuals</p>
  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm335833392">For example, on January 21, 2010, in <em data-effect="italics"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</span></em>, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), the U.S. Supreme Court heard the issue of whether the government can ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections. The Court ruled that corporations have the same Constitutional right to free speech as individuals, and thus lifted the restrictions on contributions.</p></section>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm352104864"><h3 data-type="title" class="Heading-2 ParaOverride-5">Criminal Liability</h3>
  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm333929984">The imposition of criminal liability is one method used to regulate companies. The extent of corporate liability found in an offensive act determines whether a company will be held liable for the acts and omissions of its employees. Criminal consequences may include penalties, such as prison, fines and/or community service. In addition to criminal liability, civil law remedies are usually available, e.g., the award of damages and injunctions, which may include penalties. Most jurisdictions apply both criminal and civil systems.</p>

  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm345627456">Within the business law context, torts may involve either intentional torts or negligence. Additionally, companies involved in certain industries should consider the risk of product liability. Product liability involves a legal action against a company by a consumer for a defective product that caused loss or harm to the customer. There are several theories regarding recovery under product liability. These include contract theories that deal with the product warranty, which details the promises of the nature of the product sold to customers. The contract product warranty theories are Express Warranty, Implied Warranty of Merchantability, and Implied Warranty of Fitness. Tort theories deal with a consumer claim that the company was negligent, and therefore caused either bodily harm, emotional harm, or monetary loss to the plaintiff. The tort liability theories that can be used in this context are negligence (failure to take proper care in something), strict liability (imposition of liability without a finding of fault), and acts committed under Restatement (Third) of Torts (basic elements of the tort action for liability for accidental personal injury and property damage, as well as liability for emotional harm).</p>

  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm355256768">The main function of a contract is to document promises that are enforceable by law. The key to an agreement or contract is that there must be an offer and acceptance of the terms of that offer. Sales contracts normally involve the sale of goods and include price terms, quantity and cost, how the terms of the contract will be performed, and method of delivery.</p>

  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm341719840">Employment and labor law is a very broad discipline that covers a broad array of laws and regulations involving employer/employee rights and responsibilities in the workplace. This law includes worker protection and safety laws, such as OSHA, and worker immigration laws, such as the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which imposes sanctions on employers for knowingly hiring illegal immigrants. Other notable areas of employment and labor law include, but are not limited to, the National Labor Relations Act, which deals with union and management relations, as well as Equal Opportunity in Employment laws, which provide workers with protections against discrimination in the workplace, e.g., Title VII, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and others.</p>

  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm331820656">Antitrust legislation includes both federal and state laws regulating companies’ conduct and organization. The purpose of such regulation is to allow consumers to benefit from the promotion of fair competition. The main statutes implicated by antitrust law are the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Act of 1914, and the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. These Acts discourage the restraint of trade by prohibiting the creation of cartels and other collusive practices. Additionally, they encourage competition by restricting the mergers and acquisitions of certain organizations. Finally, they prohibit the creation and abuse of monopoly power.</p>
  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm347261936">Actions may be brought in courts to enforce antitrust laws by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the U.S. Department of Justice, state governments, and private parties.</p>

  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm336819680">The term “unfair trade practices” is broadly used and refers to any deceptive or fraudulent business practice or act that causes injury to a consumer. Some examples include, but are not limited to, false representations of a good or service including deceptive pricing, non-compliance with manufacturing standards, and false advertising. The FTC investigates allegations of unfair trade practices raised by consumers and businesses, pre-merger notification filings, congressional inquiries, or reports in the media and may seek voluntary compliance by offending businesses through a consent order, administrative complaints, or federal litigation.</p>

  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm341499024">Securities regulation involves both federal and state regulation of securities and stocks by governmental regulatory agencies. At times, it may also involve the regulations of exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, as well as the rules of self-regulatory organizations like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).</p>
  <p id="auto_766aad90-38cf-4678-bdde-04bf89c9158b_fs-idm354097376">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates securities on the federal level. Other instruments related to securities, such as futures and some derivatives, are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>

			<p id="auto_1340df27-274f-4b4c-89c3-d5a78f10458e_fs-idm339989072">We frequently engage in negotiations as we go about our daily activities, often without being consciously aware that we are doing so. Negotiation can be simple, e.g., two friends deciding on a place to eat dinner, or complex, e.g., governments of several nations trying to establish import and export quotas across multiple industries. When a formal proceeding is started in the court system, <span data-type="term">alternative dispute resolution</span> (<span data-type="term">ADR</span>), or ways of solving an issue with the intent to avoid <span data-type="term">litigation</span>, may be employed. Negotiation is often the first step used in ADR. While there are other forms of alternative dispute resolution, negotiation is considered to be the simplest because it does not require outside parties. An article in the <span data-type="term">Organization Behavior and Human Decision Processes</span> defined <span data-type="term">negotiation</span> as the “process by which parties with nonidentical preferences allocate resources through interpersonal activity and joint decision making.” Analyzing the various components of this definition is helpful in understanding the theories and practices involved in negotiation as a form of dispute settlement.</p>

			<section data-depth="1" id="auto_1340df27-274f-4b4c-89c3-d5a78f10458e_fs-idm355093968"><h3 data-type="title" class="Heading-2">Negotiation Types and Objectives</h3>
			<p id="auto_1340df27-274f-4b4c-89c3-d5a78f10458e_fs-idm330346880">Per the above definition, negotiation becomes necessary when two parties hold “non-identical” preferences. This statement seems fairly obvious, since 100% agreement would indicate that there is not any need for negotiation. From this basic starting point, there are several ways of thinking about negotiation, including how many parties are involved. For example, if two small business owners find themselves in a disagreement over property lines, they will frequently engage in <span data-type="term">dyadic negotiation</span>. Put simply, dyadic negotiation involves two individuals interacting with one another in an attempt to resolve a dispute. If a third neighbor overhears the dispute and believes one or both of them are wrong with regard to the property line, then <span data-type="term">group negotiation</span> could ensue. Group negotiation involves more than two individuals or parties, and by its very nature, it is often more complex, time-consuming, and challenging to resolve. </p>
			<p id="auto_1340df27-274f-4b4c-89c3-d5a78f10458e_fs-idm346180112">While dyadic and group negotiations may involve different dynamics, one of the most important aspects of any negotiation, regardless of the quantity of negotiators, is the objective. Negotiation experts recognize two major goals of negotiation: relational and outcome. <span data-type="term">Relational goals</span> are focused on building, maintaining, or repairing a partnership, connection, or rapport with another party. <span data-type="term">Outcome goals</span>, on the other hand, concentrate on achieving certain end results. The goal of any negotiation is influenced by numerous factors, such as whether or not there will be contact with the other party in the future. For example, when a business negotiates with a supply company that it intends to do business with in the foreseeable future, it will try to focus on “win-win” solutions that provide the most value for each party. In contrast, if an interaction is of a one-time nature, that same company might approach a supplier with a “win-lose” mentality, viewing its objective as maximizing its own value at the expense of the other party’s value. This approach is referred to as <span data-type="term">zero-sum negotiation</span>, and it is considered to be a “hard” negotiating style. Zero-sum negotiation is based on the notion that there is a “fixed pie,” and the larger the slice that one party receives, the smaller the slice the other party will receive. Win-win approaches to negotiation are sometimes referred to as <span data-type="term">integrative</span>, while win-lose approaches are called <span data-type="term">distributive</span>.</p>

			<p id="auto_1340df27-274f-4b4c-89c3-d5a78f10458e_fs-idm333640912">Everyone has a different way of approaching negotiation, depending on the circumstance and the person’s personality. However, the <span data-type="term">Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) </span>is a questionnaire that provides a systematic framework for categorizing five broad negotiation styles. It is closely associated with work done by conflict resolution experts Dean Pruitt and Jeffrey Rubin. These styles are often considered in terms of the level of self-interest, instead of how other negotiators feel. These five general negotiation styles include:</p>
			<ul id="auto_1340df27-274f-4b4c-89c3-d5a78f10458e_fs-idm330239712">
				<li><span data-type="term">Forcing</span>. If a party has high concern for itself, and low concern for the other party, it may adopt a competitive approach that only takes into account the outcomes it desires. This negotiation style is most prone to zero-sum thinking. For example, a car dealership that tries to give each customer as little as possible for his or her trade-in vehicle would be applying a forcing negotiation approach. While the party using the forcing approach is only considering its own self-interests, this negotiating style often undermines the party’s long-term success. For example, in the car dealership example, if a customer feels she has not received a fair trade-in value after the sale, she may leave negative reviews and will not refer her friends and family to that dealership and will not return to it when the time comes to buy another car.</li>
				<li><span data-type="term">Collaborating</span>. If a party has high concern and care for both itself and the other party, it will often employ a collaborative negotiation that seeks to maximum the gain for both. In this negotiating style, parties recognize that acting in their mutual interests may create greater value and synergies.</li>
				<li><span data-type="term">Compromising</span>. A compromising approach to negotiation will take place when parties share some concerns for both themselves and the other party. While it is not always possible to collaborate, parties can often find certain points that are more important to one versus the other, and in that way, find ways to isolate what is most important to each party.</li>
				<li><span data-type="term">Avoiding</span>. When a party has low concern for itself and for the other party, it will often try to avoid negotiation completely. </li>
				<li><span data-type="term">Yielding</span>. Finally, when a party has low self-concern for itself and high concern for the other party, it will yield to demands that may not be in its own best interest. As with avoidance techniques, it is important to ask why the party has low self-concern. It may be due to an unfair power differential between the two parties that has caused the weaker party to feel it is futile to represent its own interests. This example illustrates why negotiation is often fraught with ethical issues.</li>

			<p id="auto_1340df27-274f-4b4c-89c3-d5a78f10458e_fs-idm335136352">Apple’s response to its treatment of warranties in China, i.e., giving one-year warranties instead of two-year warranties as required by law, serves as an example of how negotiation may be used. While Apple products continued to be successful and popular in China, the issue rankled its customers, and Chinese celebrities joined the movement to address the concern. Chinese consumers felt that Apple was arrogant and didn’t value its customers or the customers’ feedback. In response, Tim Cook issued a public apology in which he expressed regret over the misunderstanding, saying, “We are aware that insufficient communications during this process has led to the perception that Apple is arrogant and disregards, or pays little attention to, consumer feedback. We express our sincere apologies for any concern or misunderstanding arising therefrom.” Apple then listed four ways it intended to resolve the matter. By exhibiting humility and concern for its customers, Apple was able to diffuse a contentious situation that might have resulted in costly litigation.</p>

			<p id="auto_1340df27-274f-4b4c-89c3-d5a78f10458e_fs-idm333094832">Negotiations are covered by a medley of federal and state laws, such as the <span data-type="term">Federal Arbitration Act</span> and <span data-type="term">Uniform Arbitration Act</span>. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) is a national policy that favors arbitration and enforces situations in which parties have contractually agreed to participate in arbitration. Parties who have decided to be subject to binding arbitration relinquish their constitutional right to settle their dispute in court. It is the FAA that allows parties to confirm their awards, as will be discussed in the following chapters. When considering negotiation laws, it is important to keep in mind that each state has laws with their own definitions and nuances. While the purpose of the Uniform Arbitration Act in the United States was to provide a uniform approach to the way states handle arbitration, it has only been adopted in some form by about 35 states.</p>

<p id="auto_f2c0d551-b46c-4519-bd6c-e23230dac179_fs-idm239674864"><span data-type="term">Mediation</span> is a method of dispute resolution that relies on an impartial third-party decision-maker, known as a <span data-type="term">mediator</span>, to settle a dispute. While requirements vary by state, a mediator is someone who has been trained in conflict resolution, though often, he or she does not have any expertise in the subject matter that is being disputed. Mediation is another form of alternative dispute resolution. It is often used in attempts to resolve a dispute because it can help disagreeing parties avoid the time-consuming and expensive procedures involved in court litigation. Courts will often recommend that a <span data-type="term">plaintiff</span>, or the party initiating a lawsuit, and a <span data-type="term">defendant</span>, or the party that is accused of wrongdoing, attempt mediation before proceeding to trial. This recommendation is especially true for issues that are filed in small claims courts, where judges attempt to streamline dispute resolution. Not all mediators are associated with public court systems. There are many agency-connected and private mediation services that disputing parties can hire to help them potentially resolve their dispute. The American Bar Association suggests that, in addition to training courses, one of the best ways to start a private mediation business is to volunteer as a mediator. Research has shown that experience is an important factor for mediators who are seeking to cultivate sensitivity and hone their conflict resolution skills. </p>
<p id="auto_f2c0d551-b46c-4519-bd6c-e23230dac179_fs-idm224434128">For businesses, the savings associated with mediation can be substantial. For example, the energy corporation Chevron implemented an internal mediation program. In one instance, it cost $25,000 to resolve a dispute using this internal mediation program, far less than the estimated $700,000 it would have incurred through the use of outside legal services. Even more impressive is the amount it saved by not going to court, which would have cost an estimated $2.5 million. </p>
<p id="auto_f2c0d551-b46c-4519-bd6c-e23230dac179_fs-idm230070480">Mediation is distinguished by its focus on solutions. Instead of focusing on discoveries, testimonies, and expert witnesses to assess what has happened in the past, it is future-oriented. Mediators focus on discovering ways to solve the dispute in a way that will appease both parties.</p>

<ul id="auto_f2c0d551-b46c-4519-bd6c-e23230dac179_fs-idm217939040">
  <li><span data-type="term">Confidentiality</span>. Since court proceedings become a matter of public record, it can be advantageous to use mediation to preserve anonymity. This aspect can be especially important when dealing with sensitive matters, where one or both parties feels it is best to keep the situation private.</li>
  <li><span data-type="term">Creativity</span>. Mediators are trained to find ways to resolve disputes and may apply outside-the-box thinking to suggest a resolution that the parties had not considered. Since disagreeing parties can be feeling emotionally contentious toward one another, they may not be able to consider other solutions. In addition, a skilled mediator may be able to recognize cultural differences between the parties that are influencing the parties’ ability to reach a compromise, and thus leverage this awareness to create a novel solution.</li>
  <li><span data-type="term">Control</span>. When a case goes to trial, both parties give up a certain degree of control over the outcome. A judge may come up with a solution to which neither party is in favor. In contrast, mediation gives the disputing parties opportunities to find common ground on their own terms, before relinquishing control to outside forces.</li>

<p id="auto_f2c0d551-b46c-4519-bd6c-e23230dac179_fs-idm231088816">Successful mediators work to immediately establish personal rapport with the disputing parties. They often have a short period of time to interact with the parties and work to position themselves as a trustworthy advisor. The Harvard Law School Program on Negotiation reports a study by mediator Peter Adler in which mediation participants remembered the mediators as “opening the room, making coffee, and getting everyone introduced.” This quote underscores the need for mediators to play a role beyond mere administrative functions. The mediator’s conflict resolution skills are critical in guiding the parties toward reaching a resolution.</p>

<p id="auto_f2c0d551-b46c-4519-bd6c-e23230dac179_fs-idm244560832">As explained by <a href="http://nolo.com">nolo.com</a>, mediation, while not being as formal as a court trial, involves the following six steps:</p>
<ul id="auto_f2c0d551-b46c-4519-bd6c-e23230dac179_fs-idm231653952">
  <li><span data-type="term">Mediator’s Opening Statement</span>: During the opening statement, the mediator introduces himself or herself and explains the goals of mediation.</li>
  <li><span data-type="term">Opening Statements of Plaintiff and Defendant</span>: Both parties are given the opportunity to speak, without interruption. During this opening statement, both parties are afforded the opportunity to describe the nature of the dispute and their desired solution.</li>
  <li><span data-type="term">Joint Discussion</span>: The mediator will try to get the two disagreeing parties to speak to one another and will guide the discussion toward a mutually amicable solution. This part of the mediation process usually identifies which issues need to be resolved and explores ways to address the issues.</li>
  <li><span data-type="term">Private Caucus</span>: During this stage, each party has the ability to meet and speak privately with the mediator. Typically, the mediator will use this time to learn more about what is most important to each party and to brainstorm ways to find a resolution. The mediator may ask the parties to try to put aside their emotional responses and resentments to work toward an agreement.</li>
  <li><span data-type="term">Joint Negotiation</span>: After the private caucuses, the parties are joined again in the same room, and the mediator presents any newly discovered insight to guide them toward an agreement.</li>
  <li><span data-type="term">Closure</span>: During this final stage, an agreement is reached, or it is determined that the parties cannot agree. Either way, the mediator will review the positions of each party and ask them if they would like to meet again or explore escalating options, such as moving the dispute to court.</li>
</ul>

<p id="auto_f2c0d551-b46c-4519-bd6c-e23230dac179_fs-idm237915584">Both the disputants themselves, and those who attempt to facilitate dispute resolutions, i.e., mediators and attorneys, must navigate a myriad of ethical issues, such as deciding whether they should tell the entire truth, or only offer a partial disclosure. This conflict has long roots in history and has often been considered in terms of consequentialist and deontological ethical theories. <span data-type="term">Consequentialist</span> <span data-type="term">ethics</span>, sometimes known as situational ethics, is a way of looking at difficult decisions by considering their implications. Someone who follows consequentialist ethics in mediation or arbitration would consider the impact of his or her decision on the parties in light of their unique circumstances. In contrast, <span data-type="term">deontologist ethics</span> bases its decision on whether the action itself is right or wrong, regardless of its consequences.</p>
<p id="auto_f2c0d551-b46c-4519-bd6c-e23230dac179_fs-idm216654272">Imagine a situation in which a professional accountant holds a consequentialist ethical viewpoint and believes that there are certain scenarios in which the disclosure of only part of the truth is a commendable course of action. For example, if an accountant is interviewed regarding how the company handled a certain transaction in its retirement account, he might choose to withhold certain information because he is afraid it will harm the retirees’ ability to retain the full benefits of their pensions. In this case, the accountant is utilizing “the ends justify the means” logic because he feels that the omission of truth will result in more benefit than its revelation. A mediator or arbitrator who also follows a consequentialist viewpoint would consider the accountant’s motivation and the circumstances, in addition to his or her actions.</p>
<p id="auto_f2c0d551-b46c-4519-bd6c-e23230dac179_fs-idm214356224">Ethical situations like these are not only part of dispute mediation in business law scenarios, but also happen in daily life. Consider the case of a parent who is on his way home from work when he receives a call from the babysitter, telling him that his child’s forehead feels hot and that she is complaining of not feeling well. Sitting in traffic, the parent remembers that he does not know the whereabouts of the digital thermometer, so he decides to stop and purchase one. The parking lot at the store is extremely busy, so the parent decides to park in a handicapped spot, even though he does not have any mobility challenges. These types of situations have been addressed by philosophers such as Immanuel Kant, who spoke of the <span data-type="term">categorical imperative</span>, which he defined as, “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.” In other words, one’s action should be considered in light of what would happen if everyone were to engage in the same action. While it might not seem like a harmful infraction, if everyone were to do it, then it would cause a true inconvenience and possible suffering for mobility-impaired individuals, for whom those spaces were designated. A deontological ethical viewpoint would determine that it is always wrong to park in the handicapped space, regardless of the situation. In real life, it is very difficult to adopt a 100% deontological viewpoint for dispute resolution. Often, the reason the dispute has arisen in the first place is because of some ambiguity inherent in the situation. In these cases, mediators must apply their best judgment to help the disagreeing parties see one another’s viewpoints and to guide them toward a mutually amicable solution.</p>

<p id="auto_f2c0d551-b46c-4519-bd6c-e23230dac179_fs-idm226510400">As technology continues to change the ways we interact with one another, it is likely that we will see advances in mediation techniques. For example, there are companies that offer online mediation services, known as <span data-type="term">e-mediation</span>. E-mediation can be useful in situations where the parties are geographically far apart, or the transaction in dispute took place online. Ebay uses e-mediation to handle the sheer volume of misunderstandings between parties. Research has shown that one of the benefits of e-mediation is that it allows people the time needed to “cool down” when they have to explain their feelings in an email, as opposed to speaking to others in person.</p>
<p id="auto_f2c0d551-b46c-4519-bd6c-e23230dac179_fs-idm224316288">In addition to technological advancements, new findings in psychology are influencing how disputes are resolved, such as the rising interest in canine-assisted mediation (CAM), in which the presence of dogs is posited to have an impact on human emotional health. Since the presence of dogs has a positive impact on many of the neurophysiological stress markers in humans, researchers are beginning to explore the use of therapy animals to assist in dispute resolution.</p>

<p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm240075216">The American Bar Association (ABA) defines arbitration as the “private process where disputing parties agree that one or several individuals can make a decision about the dispute after receiving evidence and hearing arguments.” Arbitration is overseen by a neutral <span data-type="term">arbitrator</span>, or an individual who is responsible for making a decision on how to resolve a dispute and who has the ability to decide on an <span data-type="term">award</span>, or a course of action that the arbiter believes is fair, given the situation. An award can be a monetary payment that one party must pay to the other; however, awards need not always be financial in nature. An award may require that one business stop engaging in a certain practice that is deemed unfair to the other business. As distinguished from mediation, in which the mediator simply serves as a facilitator who is attempting to help the disagreeing parties reach an agreement, and arbitrator acts more like a judge in a court trial and often has legal expertise, although he or she may or may not have subject matter expertise. Many arbitrators are current or retired lawyers and judges. </p>

In <span data-type="term">voluntary arbitration</span>, the disputing parties have decided, of their own accord, to seek arbitration as a way to potentially settle their dispute. Depending on the state’s laws and the nature of the dispute, disagreeing parties may have to attempt arbitration before resorting to litigation; this requirement is known as <span data-type="term">involuntary arbitration</span> because it is forced upon them by an outside party.</p>
<p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm230809072">Arbitration can be either binding or non-binding. In <span data-type="term">binding arbitration</span>, the decision of the arbitrator(s) is final, and except in rare circumstances, neither party can appeal the decision through the court system. In <span data-type="term">non-binding arbitration</span>, the arbitrator’s award can be thought of as a recommendation; it is only finalized if both parties agree that it is an acceptable solution. This fact is why non-binding arbitration can be useful for what the American Arbitration Association describes as “disputes where the parties may be too far apart in their viewpoints to mediate or are in need of an objective evaluation of their respective positions.” Having a neutral party assess the situation may help disputants to rethink and reassess their positions and reach a future compromise.</p>

<p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm229570480">There are many instances in which arbitration agreements may prove helpful as a form of alternative dispute resolution. While arbitration can be useful for resolving family law matters, such as divorce, custody, and child support issues, in the domain of business law, it has three major applications:</p>
<ul id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm215097056">
  <li><span data-type="term">Labor</span>. Arbitration has often been used to resolve labor disputes through interest arbitration and grievance arbitration. <span data-type="term">Interest arbitration</span> addresses disagreements about the terms to be included in a new contract, e.g., workers of a union want their break time increased from 15 to 25 minutes. In contrast, <span data-type="term">grievance arbitration</span> covers disputes about the implementation of existing agreements. In the example previously given, if the workers felt they were being forced to work through their 15-minute break, they might engage in this type of arbitration to resolve the matter.</li>
  <li><span data-type="term">Business Transactions</span>. Whenever two parties conduct business transactions, there is potential for misunderstandings and mistakes. Both business-to-business transactions and business-to-consumer transactions can potentially be solved through arbitration. Any individual or business who is unhappy with a business transaction can attempt arbitration. Jessica Simpson recently won an arbitration case in which she disputed the release of a fitness video she had made because she felt the editor took too long to release it.</li>
  <li><span data-type="term">Property Disputes</span>. Business can have various types of property disputes. These might include disagreements over physical property, e.g., deciding where one property ends and another begins, or intellectual property, e.g., trade secrets, inventions, and artistic works.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm224744144">Typically, civil disputes, as opposed to criminal matters, attempt to use arbitration as a means of dispute resolution. While definitions can vary between municipalities, states, and countries, a <span data-type="term">civil matter</span> is generally one that is brought when one party has a grievance against another party and seeks monetary damages. In contrast, in a <span data-type="term">criminal matter</span>, a government pursues an individual or group for violating laws meant to establish the best interests of the public. While the word <span data-type="term">crime</span> often invokes the idea of violence, there are many crimes, such as embezzlement, in which the harm caused is not physical, but rather monetary.</p>

<p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm223620656">As previously discussed, going to court to solve a dispute is a costly endeavor, and for large companies, it is possible to incur millions of dollars in legal expenses. While arbitration is meant to be a form of dispute resolution that helps disagreeing parties find a low-cost, time-efficient solution, it has become increasingly important to question <em data-effect="italics">whose</em> expenses are being lowered, and to what effect. Many consumer advocates are fighting against what are known as <span data-type="term">forced-arbitration clauses</span>, in which consumers agree to settle all disputes through arbitration, effectively waiving their right to sue a company in court. Some of these forced arbitration clauses cause the other party to forfeit their right to appeal an arbitration decision or participate in any kind of <span data-type="term">class action lawsuit</span>, in which individuals who have a similar issue sue as one collective group. For example, in 2006, Enron investors initiated a class action lawsuit against executives who hid the company’s losses and were awarded $7.2 billion dollars. While this example represents a case where the company being sued was clearly in the wrong, it is important for large companies to be ethical in their use of arbitration clauses. They should not be used as a way to keep wrongdoings “quiet” or to limit consumers’ abilities to obtain rightful retribution for products and services that do not perform as promised.</p>

<p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm215314576">When parties enter into arbitration, certain procedures are followed. First, the number of arbitrators is decided, along with how they will be chosen. Parties that enter into willing arbitration may have more control over this decision, while those that do so unwillingly may have a limited pool of arbitrators from which to choose. In the case of willing arbitration, parties may decide to have three arbitrators, one chosen by each of the disputants and the third chosen by the elected arbitrators.</p>
<p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm229891152">Next, a timeline is established, and evidence is presented by both parties. Since arbitration is less formal than court proceedings, the evidence phase typically goes faster than it would in a courtroom setting. Finally, the arbitrator will make a decision and usually makes one or more awards.</p>
<p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm232564288">Not all arbitration agreements have the same procedures. It depends on the types of agreements made in advance by the disputing parties. Consider the following scenario: the owner of a large commercial office building uses a lease agreement, which stipulates that arbitration will be used to settle the renewal terms of a lease. For example, the lease may state that, at the end of year one, the second year’s lease payment will be at current market value, and if the tenants cannot agree on that value, they will then allow an arbitrator to decide. If the building owner feels that the renewal rate should be $40/square foot and the tenant feels it should be $20/square foot, an arbiter who may not be an expert in local real estate values might decide to resolve the dispute by using a rule of thumb, such as “splitting the difference.” In this case, the arbiter might decide that $30/square foot represents a fair lease renewal rate.</p>

</figure><p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm214362336">To overcome this shortcoming, the building owner could write a lease agreement that stipulates that the parties use binding <span data-type="term">baseball arbitration</span> and use subject matter experts as arbitrators. In this case, that might include real estate attorneys or commercial real estate investors. In baseball arbitration, each party would submit a lease renewal figure to an arbitrator. For example, imagine that the renewing tenant submits an offer of $10/per square foot, which is very much under market value, while the building owner submits an offer of $35/square foot. In this scenario, the arbitrator chooses one offer or the other, without modification. This type of arbitration incentivizes both parties to be fair in their dealings with one another because to do otherwise would be to their own detriment.</p>

<p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm226308512">An arbiter can issue either a “bare bones” or a reasoned award. A <span data-type="term">bare bones</span> award refers to one in which the arbitrator simply states his or her decision, while a <span data-type="term">reasoned</span> award lists the rationale behind the decision and award amount. The decision of the arbitrator is often converted to a judgement, or legal tool that allows the winning party to pursue collection action on the award. The process of converting an award to a judgement is known as confirmation.</p>

<p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm233572720">While it might seem that the party that is awarded a settlement by an arbitrator has reason to be relieved that the matter is resolved, sometimes this decision represents just one more step toward actually receiving the award. While a party may honor the award and voluntarily comply, this outcome is not always the case. In cases where the other party does not comply, the next step is to petition the court to enforce the arbitrator’s decision. This task can be accomplished by numerous mechanisms, depending on the governing laws. These include writs of execution, garnishment, and liens.</p>
<ul id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm220349856">
  <li><span data-type="term">Writ of Execution</span>. Cornell Law School defines a writ of execution as “A court order that directs law enforcement personnel to take action in an attempt to satisfy a judgment won by the plaintiff.”</li>
  <li><span data-type="term">Garnishment</span>. A garnishment refers to a court order that seizes the money, typically wages, to satisfy a debt. A myriad of laws apply to wage garnishment, e.g., certain types of income, such as Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), cannot be garnished. In addition, depending on state laws, sometimes only debtors who make over a certain amount, e.g. $1,600 gross/month, are subject to wage garnishment.</li>
  <li><span data-type="term">Liens</span>. A lien gives the entitled party in a judgement the right to seize the property of another to satisfy a debt. Commonly, liens can be placed on real estate and personal property, such as automobiles and boats. Property that has a lien cannot be sold because the title is encumbered and often cannot be legally transferred until the lien is satisfied, or paid. Depending on state laws, only certain property is subject to a lien. For example, the winning party in an arbitration case may only be able to place a lien on the other party’s vehicle if it has a market value of over $7,500.</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm229252224">The enforcement of arbitration awards is governed by a number of laws, such as Federal Arbitration Act and Uniform Arbitration Act.</p>

<p id="auto_29775cf0-668e-4e45-820d-8040ba19d33b_fs-idm230903952">Negotiation, mediation, and arbitration are alternatives form of dispute resolution that attempt to help disagreeing parties avoid the time and expense of court litigation. While negotiation is involved in all three forms, mediation and arbitration involve a neutral third party to help the parties find a solution. Frameworks that consider self-interest, as opposed to interest in the other party, can help negotiators craft successful negotiation approaches. Mediators, arbitrators, and groups of arbitrators all follow certain steps and play an important role in trying to help parties reach common ground and avoid court proceedings. Mediators who establish rapport with disputing parties can facilitate dispute resolution, as mediation is very much solution-focused. Arbitrators must often decide upon awards when parties cannot reach an agreement. Even when an aggrieved party attains an arbitration award, it may still have to pursue the other party by using a variety of legal techniques to enforce the payment or practice stipulated by the award. Staying current with federal and state laws associated with negotiation proceedings is essential for businesses looking to maximize their relational and outcome goals.</p>
