All OpenStax textbooks undergo a rigorous review process. However, like any professional-grade textbook, errors sometimes occur. In addition, the wide range of topics, data, and legal circumstances in sociology change frequently, and portions of the textbook may become out of date. Since our books are web-based, we can make updates periodically when deemed pedagogically necessary. If you have a correction to suggest, submit it through the link on your book page on openstax.org. Subject matter experts review all errata suggestions. OpenStax is committed to remaining transparent about all updates, so you will also find a list of past errata changes on your book page on openstax.org.</p>

        <h3 data-type="title">About <em data-effect="italics">Introduction to Sociology 3e</em></h3>
        <p id="auto_6454d583-84a8-4ce1-9af2-36be28532b98_import-auto-id1163653037431"><em data-effect="italics">Introduction to Sociology 3</em> aligns to the topics and objectives of many introductory sociology courses. It is arranged in a manner that provides foundational sociological theories and contexts, then progresses through various aspects of human and societal interactions. The new edition is focused on driving meaningful and memorable learning experiences related to critical thinking about society and culture. Students are challenged to look at events and situations in new ways, and, as often as possible, consider the reasons people behave and gather in the ways they do. The text includes comprehensive coverage of core concepts, discussions and data relevant to a diverse audience, and features that draw learners into the discipline in powerful and personal ways. Overall, <em data-effect="italics">Introduction to Sociology 3e</em> aims to center the course and discipline as crucial elements for understanding relationships, society, and civic engagement; we seek to lay the foundation for students to apply what they learn throughout their lives and careers.</p>
        <section data-depth="2" id="auto_6454d583-84a8-4ce1-9af2-36be28532b98_eip-746">
          <h4 data-type="title">Changes to the Third Edition</h4>
          <p id="auto_6454d583-84a8-4ce1-9af2-36be28532b98_eip-787">
The guiding principle of the revision was to build from the concept that students are not simply observers of the world, but are participants in it. Many discussions of new or ongoing changes have been improved in tone and content, based on reviewer feedback, to better reflect student experiences. Of course, much of the information in the text will be new to students, but the concepts, examples, and data are written in a way that will encourage students to apply their own experiences and to better consider those outside of their own.</p>
          <p id="auto_6454d583-84a8-4ce1-9af2-36be28532b98_eip-idm223810496">The purpose of these changes, however, is not only to make the book more informative and effective, but more so to create additional opportunities for instructors to launch relevant and interesting discussions. In concert with the changes in the text, the accompanying lecture materials have been thoroughly revised and enhanced to include material beyond what is in the book, in order for instructors--at their discretion--to deepen these engagements.
</p>
          <p id="auto_6454d583-84a8-4ce1-9af2-36be28532b98_eip-idm444327168">A number of chapter introductions have been revised with substantial vignettes or narratives relating to the chapter content. Examples include the experience of a teenager in sub-Saharan Africa (chapter 4), a comparison of the emergence of the Tea Party and the MeToo movements (chapter 6), a more nuanced and historically accurate view of the issue of marijuana criminalization and legalization (chapter 7), and a discussion of voter referendums and subsequent governmental responses (chapter 17). Other references and coverage are meant to relate to students&#x2019; careers; these include issues around online privacy, the impacts of posting offensive content, and new material on adult socialization and workplace culture.
</p>
          <p id="auto_6454d583-84a8-4ce1-9af2-36be28532b98_eip-idm436127456">Extensive use of survey outcomes and governmental data is designed to add current perspectives on the concepts and provide more discussion starters for faculty and students. Some of these outcomes may challenge preconceived notions, while others may simply be interesting to discuss. For example, poll outcomes regarding perspectives on &#x201C;When Does Someone Become Old?&#x201D; in the chapter on Aging and the Elderly may be notable on their own, but could be also used to begin reflective discussions or further research. The COVID-19 pandemic is referenced frequently, but its inclusion is meant to offer opportunities for students to share their own stories, and for instructors to lead into more current outcomes.
</p>
          <p id="auto_6454d583-84a8-4ce1-9af2-36be28532b98_eip-idm257862080">Finally, the authors, reviewers, and the entire team worked to build understanding of the causes and impacts of discrimination and prejudice. <em data-effect="italics">Introduction to Sociology 3e</em> contains dozens of examples of discrimination and its outcomes regarding social science, society, institutions, and individuals. The text seeks to strike a balance between confronting the damaging aspects of our culture and history and celebrating those who have driven change and overcome challenges. The core discussion of these topics are present in Chapter 11 on Race and Ethnicity, and Chapter 12 on Gender, Sex, and Sexuality, but their causes and effects are extensively discussed in the context of other topics, including education, law enforcement, government, healthcare, the economy, and so on. Together and when connected by an instructor, these elements have potential for deep and lasting effects.

            </h2>
            <p id="auto_bdf8b962-cd9d-4752-a983-cd3d57b50f02_fs-idm242584976">A busy commuter train station might seem like a very individualized place. Tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of strangers flow through with a singular purpose: to get where they need to go. Whether walking through main doors at a pace of a dozen people each second, or arriving by train hundreds at a time, the station can feel a bit like a balloon being pumped too full. Throngs of people cluster in tight bottlenecks until they burst through corridors and stairways and tunnels to reach the next stage of their journey. In some stations, walking against the crowd can be a tedious, nearly impossible process. And cutting across a river of determined commuters can be almost dangerous. Things are fast, relentless, and necessary.</p>
            <p id="auto_bdf8b962-cd9d-4752-a983-cd3d57b50f02_fs-idm242628064">But are those hundred thousand or half a million or, in the case of Toyko&#x2019;s Shinjuko station, 3.5 million people really acting individually? It may seem surprising, but even with those numbers, strangers from across cities can synch up on the same schedules, use the same doors, take one leg of the trip together every day before separating into different directions. After just a few months, faces can become familiar, and senses can be tuned. An experienced commuter can tell where another person is going according to their pace and whatever announcement just went out; they may slow up a bit to let the other person pass, or hold a door open just a bit longer than usual, certain that someone will grab the handle behind them. Many regulars don&#x2019;t need to check the schedule board; they sense whether a train is running late or whether a track has changed simply by the movement of the crowd.</p>
            <p id="auto_bdf8b962-cd9d-4752-a983-cd3d57b50f02_fs-idm235410288">And then the customs develop: Which side to walk on, how fast to go, where to stand, how much space to leave between people on the escalator. When you board early, which seat should you take? When you see someone running for the train, do you jam the closing door with your foot? How does the crowd treat people who ask for food or money? What&#x2019;s the risk level in telling someone to be quiet?</p>
            <p id="auto_bdf8b962-cd9d-4752-a983-cd3d57b50f02_fs-idm224142144">Very few of these behaviors are taught. None are written down. But the transit hub, that pocket of constant flow, is an echo of its society. It takes on some aspects of the city and country around it, but its people also form an informal group of their own. Sociologists, as you will learn, may study these people. Sociologists may seek to understand how they feel about their trip, be it proud or annoyed or just plain exhausted. Sociologists might study how length of commute relates to job satisfaction or family relationships. They may study the ways that conditions of a train station affect attitudes about government, or how the difficulty of commuting may lead people to relocate. This understanding isn&#x2019;t just a collection of interesting facts; it can influence government policy and spending decisions, employer interventions, and healthcare practices. The work sociologists do to understand our society, and the work you will do in learning about it, is meaningful to our lives and our futures.</p>

          <p id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_fs-idm366695632">Sociologists study all aspects and levels of society.

For example, a micro-level study might look at the accepted rules of conversation in various groups such as among teenagers or business professionals. In contrast, a macro-level analysis might research the ways that language use has changed over time or in social media outlets.</p>
          <p id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_fs-idm384784512">The term <span data-type="term" id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_term5" group-by="c">culture</span> refers to the group&#x2019;s shared practices, values, and beliefs. Culture encompasses a group&#x2019;s way of life, from routine, everyday interactions to the most important parts of group members&#x2019; lives. It includes everything produced by a society, including all the social rules.</p>
          <p id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_fs-idm383117360">Sociologists often study culture using the <span data-type="term" id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_term6" group-by="s">sociological imagination</span>, which pioneer sociologist C. Wright Mills described as an awareness of the relationship between a person&#x2019;s behavior and experience and the wider culture that shaped the person&#x2019;s choices and perceptions. It&#x2019;s a way of seeing our own and other people&#x2019;s behavior in relationship to history and social structure (1959). One illustration of this is a person&#x2019;s decision to marry. In the United States, this choice is heavily influenced by individual feelings. However, the social acceptability of marriage relative to the person&#x2019;s circumstances also plays a part.</p>
          <p id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_fs-idm362621248">Remember, though, that culture is a product of the people in a society. Sociologists take care not to treat the concept of &#x201C;culture&#x201D; as though it were alive and real. The error of treating an abstract concept as though it has a real, material existence is known as reification (Sahn, 2013).</p>

The &#x201C;typical&#x201D; family in past decades consisted of married parents living in a home with their unmarried children. Today, the percent of unmarried couples, same-sex couples, single-parent and single-adult households is increasing, as well as is the number of expanded households, in which extended family members such as grandparents, cousins, or adult children live together in the family home. While 15 million mothers still make up the majority of single parents, 3.5 million fathers are also raising their children alone (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020). Increasingly, single men and women and cohabitating opposite-sex or same-sex couples are choosing to raise children outside of marriage through surrogates or adoption.</p>

          <p id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_fs-idm378817712">A key component of the sociological perspective is the idea that the individual and society are inseparable. It is impossible to study one without the other. German sociologist Norbert Elias called the process of simultaneously analyzing the behavior of individuals and the society that shapes that behavior <span data-type="term" id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_term9" group-by="f">figuration</span>.</p>
          <p id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_fs-idm378090320">Consider religion. While people experience religion in a distinctly individual manner, religion exists in a larger social context as a <span data-type="term" id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_term10" group-by="s">social institution</span>. For instance, an individual&#x2019;s religious practice may be influenced by what government dictates, holidays, teachers, places of worship, rituals, and so on. These influences underscore the important relationship between individual practices of religion and social pressures that influence that religious experience (Elias, 1978). In simpler terms, figuration means that as one analyzes the social institutions in a society, the individuals using that institution in any fashion need to be &#x2018;figured&#x2019; in to the analysis.</p>

              <p id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_import-auto-id1350084">When sociologist Nathan Kierns spoke to his friend Ashley (a pseudonym) about the move she and her partner had made from an urban center to a small Midwestern town, he was curious about how the social pressures placed on a lesbian couple differed from one community to the other. Ashley said that in the city they had been accustomed to getting looks and hearing comments when she and her partner walked hand in hand. Otherwise, she felt that they were at least being tolerated. There had been little to no outright discrimination.</p>
              <p id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_import-auto-id1362194">Things changed when they moved to the small town for her partner&#x2019;s job. For the first time, Ashley found herself experiencing direct discrimination because of her sexual orientation. Some of it was particularly hurtful. Landlords would not rent to them. Ashley, who is a highly trained professional, had a great deal of difficulty finding a new job.</p>
              <p id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_import-auto-id1338201">When Nathan asked Ashley if she and her partner became discouraged or bitter about this new situation, Ashley said that rather than letting it get to them, they decided to do something about it. Ashley approached groups at a local college and several churches in the area. Together they decided to form the town's first Gay-Straight Alliance.</p>
              <p id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_import-auto-id1350096">The alliance has worked successfully to educate their community about same-sex couples. It also worked to raise awareness about the kinds of discrimination that Ashley and her partner experienced in the town and how those could be eliminated. The alliance has become a strong advocacy group, and it is working to attain equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, or LBGTQ individuals.</p>
              <p id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_import-auto-id2690429">Kierns observed that this is an excellent example of how negative social forces can result in a positive response from individuals to bring about social change (Kierns, 2011).</p>

        <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm374166608">For millennia, people have been fascinated by the relationships between individuals and societies. Many topics studied by ancient philosophers in their desire to describe an ideal society are still studied in modern sociology, including theories of social conflict, economics, social cohesion, and power in a continued attempt to describe an ideal society (Hannoum, 2003). Although we are more familiar with western philosophers like Plato and his student, Aristotle, eastern philosophers also thought about social issues.</p>
        <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm374289680">Until recently, we have very few texts that are non-religious in nature that theorize about social life. From 4<sup>th</sup> century through the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the Catholic Church was the seat of power from today&#x2019;s Turkey in the east to western and northern Europe, including the British Isles. Only monks who were charged with rewriting holy texts by hand and the aristocracy were literate. Moreover, the Church consolidated power. In the year 800, Pope Leo III named Charlemagne, the king of Francia (today&#x2019;s France, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany) emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, giving one individual control over most of Europe. Doing so gave the Catholic Church the power to maintain its own traditions safeguard them from the influence of people practicing other religions. If any social patterns challenged any belief of the Church, those practitioners were massacred, burned at the stake, or labeled heretics. As a result, the records that we have are extremely subjective and do not offer an unbiased view of social practice.</p>
        <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm323209184">In the 13<sup>th</sup> century, Ma Tuan-Lin, a Chinese historian, was the first to record, in his seminal encyclopedia titled <em data-effect="italics">General Study of Literary Remains</em>, the social dynamics underlying and generating historical development.</p>
        <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm362549376">In the 14<sup>th</sup> century, , the Tunisian historian Ibn Khaldun (1332&#x2013;1406) set the foundation for both modern sociology and economics. Khaldun proposed a theory of social conflict and provided a comparison of nomadic and sedentary life, an analysis of political economy, and a study connecting a tribe&#x2019;s social cohesion to its capacity for power (Hannoum, 2003). Khaldun often challenged authorities. As sociologists continue to study and report on social issues and problems, they often find themselves in the center of controversy.</p>
        <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm347142896">From 1347 to 1522, the bubonic plague ravaged Europe, killing up to 35% of population (Armstrong, 2019). The plague dealt a major blow to the credibility of the Catholic Church. Out of this chaos emerged the the work of Copernicus, Galileo, Leonardo, Newton, Linnaeus, and other philosophers whose work sometimes contradicted church teachings. Events once held to be the product of the divine hand could be analyzed by human reason and observation and could be explained by scientific, testable, and retestable hypotheses. As literacy spread through conquests and colonization, more records and literature became available for sociologists and historians to put social puzzles together.</p>
        <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm363388064">In the 18<sup>th</sup> century, Enlightenment philosophers developed general principles that could be used to explain social life. Thinkers such as John Locke, Fran&#xE7;ois-Marie Arouet (Voltaire), Immanuel Kant, and Thomas Hobbes responded to what they saw as social ills by writing on topics that they hoped would lead to social reform. Mary Wollstonecraft (1759&#x2013;1797) wrote about women&#x2019;s conditions in society. Like Harriet Martineau and Jane Addams, her works were long ignored by the male academic structure, but since the 1970s, Wollstonecraft has been widely considered the first feminist thinker of consequence. Ideas about economic systems, the family, health and hygiene, national offense and defense, were among the many concerns of social life.</p>
        <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm373320256">The early 19<sup>th</sup> century saw great changes with the Industrial Revolution, increased mobility, and new kinds of employment. It was also a period of increased trade, travel, and globalization that exposed many people &#x2014; for the first time&#x2014;to societies and cultures other than their own. Millions of people moved into cities and many people turned away from their traditional religious beliefs. Ideas spread rapidly, groups were created, political decisions became public decisions. Among a new generation of philosophers, there were some who believed they could make sense of it all.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">Auguste Comte (1798 &#x2013; 1857)</h4>
            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm376254112">The term sociology was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist Emmanuel-Joseph Siey&#xE8;s (1748&#x2013;1836) in an unpublished manuscript (Faur&#xE9; et al. 1999). In 1838, the term was reintroduced by Auguste Comte (1798&#x2013;1857). Comte originally studied to be an engineer, but later became a pupil of social philosopher Claude Henri de Rouvroy Comte de Saint-Simon (1760&#x2013;1825). They both thought that social scientists could study society using the same scientific methods utilized in natural sciences. Comte also believed in the potential of social scientists to work toward the betterment of society. He held that once scholars identified the laws that governed society, sociologists could address problems such as poor education and poverty (Abercrombie et al. 2000).</p>

He described his philosophy in a series of books called <em data-effect="italics">The Course in Positive Philosophy</em> (1830&#x2013;1842) and <em data-effect="italics">A General View of Positivism</em> (1848). He believed that revealing the laws by which societies and individuals interact would usher in a new &#x201C;positivist&#x201D; age of history. While the field and its terminology have grown, sociologists still believe in the positive impact of their work.</p>

            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm359098928">Harriet Martineau introduced sociology to English speaking scholars through her translation of Comte&#x2019;s writing from French to English. She was an early analyst of social practices, including economics, social class, religion, suicide, government, and women&#x2019;s rights. Her career began <em data-effect="italics">Illustrations of Political Economy</em>, a work educating ordinary people about the principles of economics (Johnson, 2003). She later developed the first systematic methodological international comparisons of social institutions in two of her most famous sociological works: <em data-effect="italics">Society in America</em> (1837) and <em data-effect="italics">Retrospect of Western Travel</em> (1838).</p>
            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm355858304">Martineau found the workings of capitalism at odds with the professed moral principles of people in the United States. She pointed out the faults with the free enterprise system in which workers were exploited and impoverished while business owners became wealthy. She further noted that the belief that all are created equal was inconsistent with the lack of women&#x2019;s rights. Much like Mary Wollstonecraft, Martineau was often discounted in her own time because academic sociology was a male-dominated profession.</p>

            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm380507104">Karl Marx was a German philosopher and economist. In 1848, he and Friedrich Engels (1820&#x2013;1895) coauthored the <em data-effect="italics">Communist Manifesto</em>. This book is one of the most influential political manuscripts in history. It also presents Marx&#x2019;s theory of society, which differed from what Comte proposed.</p>
            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm386023152">Marx rejected Comte&#x2019;s positivism. He believed that societies grew and changed as a result of the struggles of different social classes over the means of production. At the time he was developing his theories, the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism led to great disparities in wealth between the owners of the factories and workers. Capitalism, an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of goods and the means to produce them, had developed in many nations.</p>
            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm367642880">Marx predicted that inequalities of capitalism would become so extreme that workers would eventually revolt. This would lead to the collapse of capitalism, which would be replaced by communism. Communism is an economic system under which there is no private or corporate ownership: everything is owned communally and distributed as needed. Marx believed that communism was a more equitable system than capitalism.</p>
            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm368338480">While his economic predictions did not materialize in the time frame he predicted, Marx&#x2019;s idea that social conflict leads to change in society is still one of the major theories used in modern sociology.</p>

Spencer rejected much of Comte&#x2019;s philosophy as well as Marx&#x2019;s theory of class struggle and his support of communism. Instead, he favored a form of government that allowed market forces to control capitalism. His work influenced many early sociologists including &#xC9;mile Durkheim (1858&#x2013;1917). Spencer, using Charles Darwin&#x2019;s work as a comparison said, &#x201C;This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called &#x2018;natural selection,&#x2019; or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.&#x201D; (Spencer, 1864) The statement is often misinterpreted and adopted by those who believe in the superiority of one race over another.</p>

Simmel took an anti-positivism stance and addressed topics such as social conflict, the function of money, individual identity in city life, and the European fear of outsiders (Stapley 2010). Much of his work focused on micro-level theories and analyzed the dynamics of two-person and three-person groups. His work also emphasized individual culture as the creative capacities of individuals (Ritzer and Goodman 2004).</p>

            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm373305728">&#xC9;mile Durkheim helped establish sociology as a formal academic discipline by establishing the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895 and by publishing his <em data-effect="italics">Rules of the Sociological Method</em> in 1895. In <em data-effect="italics">Division of Labour in Society</em> (1893), Durkheim further laid out his theory on how societies transformed from a primitive state into a capitalist, industrial society. According to Durkheim, people rise to their proper levels in society based on merit.</p>
            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm379517344">Durkheim believed that sociologists could study objective social facts (Poggi, 2000). He also believed that through such studies it would be possible to determine if a society was &#x201C;healthy&#x201D; or &#x201C;pathological.&#x201D; Healthy societies were stable while pathological societies experienced a breakdown in social norms.</p>
            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm386284064">In 1897, Durkheim attempted to demonstrate the effectiveness of his rules of social research when he published a work titled <em data-effect="italics">Suicide</em>. Durkheim examined suicide statistics in different police districts to research differences between Catholic and Protestant communities. He attributed the differences to socio-religious forces rather than to individual or psychological causes.</p>

            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm387403296">Prominent sociologist Max Weber established a sociology department in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich in 1919. Weber wrote on many topics related to sociology including political change in Russia and social forces that affect factory workers. He is known best for his 1904 book, <em data-effect="italics">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</em>. The theory that Weber sets forth in this book is still controversial. Some believe that Weber argued that the beliefs of many Protestants, especially Calvinists, led to the rise of capitalism. Others interpret it as simply claiming that the ideologies of capitalism and Protestantism are complementary.</p>
            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm382905456">Weber believed that it was difficult, if not impossible, to use standard scientific methods to accurately predict the behavior of groups as some sociologists hoped to do. Weber argued that the influence of culture on human behavior had to be taken into account. This even applied to the researchers themselves, who should be aware of how their own cultural biases could influence their research. To deal with this problem, Weber and Wilhelm Dilthey introduced the concept of <em data-effect="italics">verstehen</em>, a German word that means to understand in a deep way. In seeking <em data-effect="italics">verstehen</em>, outside observers of a social world&#x2014;an entire culture or a small setting&#x2014;attempt to understand it from an insider&#x2019;s point of view.</p>
            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm384581760">In his book, <em data-effect="italics">The Nature of Social Action</em>, Weber described sociology as striving to &#x201C;&#x2026; interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which action proceeds and the effects it produces.&#x201D; He and other like-minded sociologists proposed a philosophy of anti-positivism whereby social researchers would strive for subjectivity as they worked to represent social processes, cultural norms, and societal values. This approach led to some research methods whose aim was not to generalize or predict (traditional in science), but to systematically gain an in-depth understanding of social worlds.</p>
            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm384083424">The different approaches to research based on positivism or anti-positivism are often considered the foundation for the differences found today between quantitative sociology and qualitative sociology. Quantitative sociology uses statistical methods such as surveys with large numbers of participants. Researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human behavior. Qualitative sociology seeks to understand human behavior by learning about it through in-depth interviews, focus groups, and analysis of content sources (like books, magazines, journals, and popular media).</p>

Opponents of raising the minimum wage argue that some workers would get larger paychecks while others would lose their jobs, and companies would be less likely to hire new workers because of the increased cost of paying them. Biden and other proponents of raising the minimum wage contend that some job loss would be greatly offset by the positive effects on the standard of living of low-wage workers and reducing the income gap between the rich and poor.</p>
                <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm378403840">Sociologists may consider the minimum wage issue from differing perspectives as well. How much of an impact would a minimum wage raise have for a single mother? Some might study the economic effects, such as her ability to pay bills and keep food on the table. Others might look at how reduced economic stress could improve family relationships. Some sociologists might research the impact on the status of small business owners. These could all be examples of public sociology, a branch of sociology that strives to bring sociological dialogue to public forums. The goals of public sociology are to increase understanding of the social factors that underlie social problems and assist in finding solutions. According to Michael Burawoy (2005), the challenge of public sociology is to engage multiple publics in multiple ways.</p>

William Sumner held the first professorship in sociology (Yale University), Franklin Giddings was the first full professor of Sociology (Columbia University), and Albion Small wrote the first sociology textbook. Early American sociologists tested and applied the theories of the Europeans and became leaders in social research. Lester Ward (1841 &#x2013; 1913) developed social research methods and argued for the use of the scientific method and quantitative data (Chapter 2) to show the effectiveness of policies. In order for sociology to gain respectability in American academia, social researchers understood that they must adopt empirical approaches.</p>

Du Bois, a Harvard-trained historian, pioneered the use of rigorous empirical methodology into sociology. His groundbreaking 1896-1897 study of the African American community in Philadelphia incorporated hundreds of interviews Du Bois conducted in order to document the familial and employment structures and assess the chief challenges of the community. These new, comprehensive research methods stood in stark contrast to the less scientific practices of the time, which Du Bois critiqued as being similar to doing research as if through the window of a moving car. His scientific approach became highly influential to entire schools of sociological study, and is considered a forerunner to contemporary practices. Additionally, Du Bois&#x2019; 1899 publication provided empirical evidence to challenge pseudoscientific ideas of biological racism (Morris, 2015; Green &amp; Wortham, 2018), which had been used as justification to oppress people of different races.</p>
            <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm380625312">Du Bois also played a prominent role in the effort to increase rights for Black people. Concerned at the slow pace of progress and advice from some Black leaders to be more accommodating of racism, Du Bois became a leader in what would later be known as the Niagara Movement. In 1905, he and others drafted a declaration that called for immediate political, economic, and social equality for African Americans. A few years later, he helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and served as its director of publications.</p>

Attached to the Chicago School, Park focused on how individuals lived within their environment. One of the first sociologists to focus on ethnic minorities, he wrote on the Belgian oppression of the Congolese. When he returned to the US, he and Ernest Burgess researched the inner city to show that no matter who lived there, social chaos was prevalent. As such, it was not the residents who caused the chaos but the environment.</p>

        <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm267791856">Sociologists study social events, interactions, and patterns, and they develop theories to explain why things work as they do. In sociology, a theory is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and to create a testable proposition, called a <span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term14" group-by="h">hypothesis</span>, about society (Allan 2006).</p>
        <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm544519520">For example, although suicide is generally considered an individual phenomenon, &#xC9;mile Durkheim was interested in studying the social factors that affect it. He studied <span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term15" group-by="s">social solidarity</span>, social ties within a group, and hypothesized that differences in suicide rates might be explained by religious differences. Durkheim gathered a large amount of data about Europeans and found that Protestants were more likely to commit suicide than Catholics. His work supports the utility of theory in sociological research.</p>
        <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm271358928">Theories vary in scope depending on the scale of the issues that they are meant to explain. Macro-level theories relate to large-scale issues and large groups of people, while micro-level theories look at very specific relationships between individuals or small groups. <span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term16" group-by="G">Grand theories</span> attempt to explain large-scale relationships and answer fundamental questions such as why societies form and why they change. Sociological theory is constantly evolving and should never be considered complete. Classic sociological theories are still considered important and current, but new sociological theories build upon the work of their predecessors and add to them (Calhoun, 2002).</p>
        <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm224726480">In sociology, a few theories provide broad perspectives that help explain many different aspects of social life, and these are called <span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term17" group-by="p">paradigms</span>. Paradigms are philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to formulate theories, generalizations, and the experiments performed in support of them. Three paradigms have come to dominate sociological thinking because they provide useful explanations: structural functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Functionalism</h3>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm545753184"><span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term18" group-by="F">Functionalism</span>, also called structural-functional theory, sees society as a structure with interrelated parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society. Functionalism grew out of the writings of English philosopher and biologist, Herbert Spencer, who saw similarities between society and the human body. He argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning, the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning (Spencer, 1898). The parts of society that Spencer referred to were the <span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term19" group-by="s">social institutions</span>, or patterns of beliefs and behaviors focused on meeting social needs, such as government, education, family, healthcare, religion, and the economy.</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm271360816">&#xC9;mile Durkheim applied Spencer&#x2019;s theory to explain how societies change and survive over time. Durkheim believed that society is a complex system of interrelated and interdependent parts that work together to maintain stability (Durkheim, 1893), and that society is held together by shared values, languages, and symbols. He believed that to study society, a sociologist must look beyond individuals to social facts such as laws, morals, values, religious beliefs, customs, fashion, and rituals, which all serve to govern social life (Durkheim, 1895). Alfred Radcliff-Brown (1881&#x2013;1955) defined the <span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term20" group-by="f">function</span> of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole, and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity (Radcliff-Brown 1952). In a healthy society, all parts work together to maintain stability, a state called <span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term21" group-by="d">dynamic equilibrium</span> by later sociologists such as Parsons (1961).</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm238596544">Durkheim believed that individuals may make up society, but in order to study society, sociologists have to look beyond individuals to social facts. . Each of these social facts serves one or more functions within a society. For example, one function of a society&#x2019;s laws may be to protect society from violence, while another is to punish criminal behavior, while another is to preserve public health.</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm263833552">Another noted structural functionalist, Robert Merton (1910&#x2013;2003), pointed out that social processes often have many functions. <span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term22" group-by="M">Manifest functions</span> are the consequences of a social process that are sought or anticipated, while <span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term23" group-by="l">latent functions</span> are the unsought consequences of a social process. A manifest function of a college education, for example, includes gaining knowledge, preparing for a career, and finding a good job that utilizes that education. Latent functions of your college years include meeting new people, participating in extracurricular activities, or even finding a spouse or partner. Another latent function of education is creating a hierarchy of employment based on the level of education attained. Latent functions can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful. Social processes that have undesirable consequences for the operation of society are called <span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term24" group-by="d">dysfunctions</span>. In education, examples of dysfunction include getting bad grades, truancy, dropping out, not graduating, and not finding suitable employment.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">Criticism</h4>
            <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm239339744">One criticism of the structural-functional theory is that it can&#x2019;t adequately explain social change even though the functions are processes. Also problematic is the somewhat circular nature of this theory: repetitive behavior patterns are assumed to have a function, yet we profess to know that they have a function only because they are repeated. Furthermore, dysfunctions may continue, even though they don&#x2019;t serve a function, which seemingly contradicts the basic premise of the theory. Many sociologists now believe that functionalism is no longer useful as a macro-level theory, but that it does serve a useful purpose in some mid-level analyses.</p>

In the past, empires such as those that existed in China, Europe, Africa, and Central and South America linked people from many different countries, but those people rarely became part of a common culture. They lived too far from each other, spoke different languages, practiced different religions, and traded few goods. Today, increases in communication, travel, and trade have made the world a much smaller place. More and more people are able to communicate with each other instantly&#x2014;wherever they are located&#x2014;by telephone, video, and text. They share movies, television shows, music, games, and information over the Internet. Students can study with teachers and pupils from the other side of the globe. Governments find it harder to hide conditions inside their countries from the rest of the world.</p>

Some explore the dynamics involved in the social interactions of global online communities, such as when members feel a closer kinship to other group members than to people residing in their own countries. Other sociologists study the impact this growing international culture has on smaller, less-powerful local cultures. Yet other researchers explore how international markets and the outsourcing of labor impact social inequalities. Sociology can play a key role in people&#x2019;s abilities to understand the nature of this emerging global culture and how to respond to it.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Conflict Theory</h3>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm270181712"><span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term25" group-by="C">Conflict theory</span> looks at society as a competition for limited resources. This perspective is a macro-level approach most identified with the writings of German philosopher and sociologist Karl Marx, who saw society as being made up of individuals in different social classes who must compete for social, material, and political resources such as food and housing, employment, education, and leisure time. Social institutions like government, education, and religion reflect this competition in their inherent inequalities and help maintain the unequal social structure. Some individuals and organizations are able to obtain and keep more resources than others, and these &#x201C;winners&#x201D; use their power and influence to maintain social institutions. The perpetuation of power results in the perpetuation of oppression.</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm255100080">Several theorists suggested variations on this basic theme like Polish-Austrian sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838&#x2013;1909) who expanded on Marx&#x2019;s ideas by arguing that war and conquest are the bases of civilizations. He believed that cultural and ethnic conflicts led to states being identified and defined by a dominant group that had power over other groups (Irving, 2007).</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm265598848">German sociologist Max Weber agreed with Marx but also believed that, in addition to economic inequalities, inequalities of political power and social structure cause conflict. Weber noted that different groups were affected differently based on education, race, and gender, and that people&#x2019;s reactions to inequality were moderated by class differences and rates of social mobility, as well as by perceptions about the legitimacy of those in power. A reader of Marx, Georg Simmel believed that conflict can help integrate and stabilize a society. He said that the intensity of the conflict varies depending on the emotional involvement of the parties, the degree of solidarity within the opposing groups, and the clarity and limited nature of the goals. Simmel also showed that groups work to create internal solidarity, centralize power, and reduce dissent. The stronger the bond, the weaker the discord. Resolving conflicts can reduce tension and hostility and can pave the way for future agreements.</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm547264528">In the 1930s and 1940s, German philosophers, known as the Frankfurt School, developed <span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term26" group-by="c">critical theory</span> as an elaboration on Marxist principles. Critical theory is an expansion of conflict theory and is broader than just sociology, incorporating other social sciences and philosophy. A critical theory is a holistic theory and attempts to address structural issues causing inequality. It must explain what&#x2019;s wrong in current social reality, identify the people who can make changes, and provide practical goals for social transformation (Horkeimer, 1982).</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm245583648">More recently, inequality based on gender or race has been explained in a similar manner and has identified institutionalized power structures that help to maintain inequality between groups. Janet Saltzman Chafetz (1941&#x2013;2006) presented a model of feminist theory that attempts to explain the forces that maintain gender inequality as well as a theory of how such a system can be changed (Turner, 2003). Similarly, critical race theory grew out of a critical analysis of race and racism from a legal point of view. Critical race theory looks at structural inequality based on white privilege and associated wealth, power, and prestige.</p>

                <span class="os-subtitle-label">Farming and Locavores: How Sociological Perspectives Might View Food Consumption</span>
              </h4>
              <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm247292224">The consumption of food is a commonplace, daily occurrence. Yet, it can also be associated with important moments in our lives. Eating can be an individual or a group action, and eating habits and customs are influenced by our cultures. In the context of society, our nation&#x2019;s food system is at the core of numerous social movements, political issues, and economic debates. Any of these factors might become a topic of sociological study.</p>
              <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm264457632">A structural-functional approach to the topic of food consumption might analyze the role of the agriculture industry within the nation&#x2019;s economy and how this has changed from the early days of manual-labor farming to modern mechanized production. Another might study the different functions of processes in food production, from farming and harvesting to flashy packaging and mass consumerism.</p>
              <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm281370608">A conflict theorist might be interested in the power differentials present in the regulation of food, by exploring where people&#x2019;s right to information intersects with corporations&#x2019; drive for profit and how the government mediates those interests. Or a conflict theorist might examine the power and powerlessness experienced by local farmers versus large farming conglomerates, such as the documentary Food Inc., which depicts as resulting from Monsanto&#x2019;s patenting of seed technology. Another topic of study might be how nutrition varies between different social classes.</p>
              <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm243561712">A sociologist viewing food consumption through a symbolic interactionist lens would be more interested in microlevel topics, such as the symbolic use of food in religious rituals, or the role it plays in the social interaction of a family dinner. This perspective might also explore the interactions among group members who identify themselves based on their sharing a particular diet, such as vegetarians (people who don&#x2019;t eat meat) or locavores (people who strive to eat locally produced food).</p>

Many social structures are extremely stable or have gradually progressed over time rather than changing abruptly as conflict theory would suggest.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Symbolic Interactionist Theory</h3>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm243615808">Symbolic interactionism is a micro-level theory that focuses on the relationships among individuals within a society. Communication&#x2014;the exchange of meaning through language and symbols&#x2014;is believed to be the way in which people make sense of their social worlds. Theorists Herman and Reynolds (1994) note that this perspective sees people as being active in shaping the social world rather than simply being acted upon.</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm262477024">George Herbert Mead is considered a founder of symbolic interactionism though he never published his work on it (LaRossa and Reitzes, 1993). Mead&#x2019;s student, Herbert Blumer (1900-1987), coined the term &#x201C;symbolic interactionism&#x201D; and outlined these basic premises: humans interact with things based on meanings ascribed to those things; the ascribed meaning of things comes from our interactions with others and society; the meanings of things are interpreted by a person when dealing with things in specific circumstances (Blumer 1969). If you love books, for example, a symbolic interactionist might propose that you learned that books are good or important in the interactions you had with family, friends, school, or church. Maybe your family had a special reading time each week, getting your library card was treated as a special event, or bedtime stories were associated with warmth and comfort.</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm252310912">Social scientists who apply symbolic-interactionist thinking look for patterns of interaction between individuals. Their studies often involve observation of one-on-one interactions. For example, while a conflict theorist studying a political protest might focus on class difference, a symbolic interactionist would be more interested in how individuals in the protesting group interact, as well as the signs and symbols protesters use to communicate their message.</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm248145376">The focus on the importance of symbols in building a society led sociologists like Erving Goffman (1922-1982) to develop a technique called <span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term27" group-by="d">dramaturgical analysis</span>. Goffman used theater as an analogy for social interaction and recognized that people&#x2019;s interactions showed patterns of cultural &#x201C;scripts.&#x201D; He argued that individuals were actors in a play. We switched roles, sometimes minute to minute&#x2014;for example, from student or daughter to dog walker. Because it can be unclear what part a person may play in a given situation, he or she has to improvise his or her role as the situation unfolds (Goffman, 1958).</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm249128560">Studies that use the symbolic interactionist perspective are more likely to use qualitative research methods, such as in-depth interviews or participant observation, because they seek to understand the symbolic worlds in which research subjects live.</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm247765104"><span data-type="term" id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_term28" group-by="C">Constructivism</span> is an extension of symbolic interaction theory which proposes that reality is what humans cognitively construct it to be. We develop social constructs based on interactions with others, and those constructs that last over time are those that have meanings which are widely agreed-upon or generally accepted by most within the society. This approach is often used to examine what&#x2019;s defined as deviant within a society. There is no absolute definition of deviance, and different societies have constructed different meanings for deviance, as well as associating different behaviors with deviance.</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm232567200">One situation that illustrates this is what you believe you&#x2019;re to do if you find a wallet in the street. In the United States, turning the wallet in to local authorities would be considered the appropriate action, and to keep the wallet would be seen as deviant. In contrast, many Eastern societies would consider it much more appropriate to keep the wallet and search for the owner yourself. Turning it over to someone else, even the authorities, would be considered deviant behavior.</p>

Others criticize the extremely narrow focus on symbolic interaction. Proponents, of course, consider this one of its greatest strengths.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Sociological Theory Today</h3>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm251424768">These three approaches still provide the main foundation of modern sociological theory though they have evolved. Structural-functionalism was a dominant force after World War II and until the 1960s and 1970s. At that time, sociologists began to feel that structural-functionalism did not sufficiently explain the rapid social changes happening in the United States at that time. The women&#x2019;s movement and the Civil Rights movement forced academics to develop approaches to study these emerging social practices.</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm278857120">Conflict theory then gained prominence, with its emphasis on institutionalized social inequality. Critical theory, and the particular aspects of feminist theory and critical race theory, focused on creating social change through the application of sociological principles. The field saw a renewed emphasis on helping ordinary people understand sociology principles, in the form of public sociology.</p>
          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm252706000">Gaining prominence in the wake of Mead&#x2019;s work in the 1920s and 1930s, symbolic interactionism declined in influence during the 1960s and 1970s only to be revitalized at the turn of the twenty-first century (Stryker, 1987). Postmodern social theory developed in the 1980s to look at society through an entirely new lens by rejecting previous macro-level attempts to explain social phenomena. Its growth in popularity coincides with the rise of constructivist views of symbolic interactionism.</p>

But she knew she had the law on her side. Three years earlier in the landmark <em data-effect="italics">Brown vs. the Board of Education</em> decision, the U.S. Supreme Court had overturned twenty-one state laws that allowed Black and White people to be taught in separate school systems as long as the school systems were &#x201C;equal.&#x201D; The decision was nothing short of momentous, not only for education, but for a number of other segregation and discrimination issues that have lasted into this decade. And in that momentous decision, the Supreme Court cited the research of the husband-and-wife team of social scientists, Kenneth and Mamie Clark, as evidence that segregation generates in minority students a feeling of inferiority. In the &#x2018;doll test,&#x2019; for example, the Clarks showed children four dolls, two with white skin and yellow hair and two with brown skin and black hair. When asked which doll they preferred, the majority of Black children chose the doll with the light skin doll, and they assigned positive characteristics to it. Most of the Black children discarded the doll with the brown skin&#x2014;the one that had a closer resemblance to themselves.</p>

The Clarks&#x2019; research contributed to the Supreme Court&#x2019;s conclusion that separate but equal was damaging to students, and that separate facilities are unequal.</p>

Besides desegregation, sociology has played a crucial role in many important social reforms, such as equal opportunity for women in the workplace, improved treatment for individuals with mental handicaps or learning disabilities, increased accessibility and accommodation for people with physical handicaps, the right of native populations to preserve their land and culture, and prison system reforms.</p>
          <p id="auto_e13dda45-c995-47e5-8146-0ac7e1015ce6_fs-idm237896688">The predominant American sociologist, the late Peter L. Berger (1929&#x2013;2017), in his 1963 book, <em data-effect="italics">Invitation to Sociology: A Humanistic Perspective</em>, describes a sociologist as &#x201C;someone concerned with understanding society in a disciplined way.&#x201D; He asserts that sociologists have a natural interest in the monumental moments of people&#x2019;s lives, as well as a fascination with banal, everyday occurrences. Berger also describes the &#x201C;aha&#x201D; moment when a sociological theory becomes applicable and understood:</p>
          <blockquote id="auto_e13dda45-c995-47e5-8146-0ac7e1015ce6_fs-idm266269776">
            <p id="auto_e13dda45-c995-47e5-8146-0ac7e1015ce6_fs-idm224248416">[T]here is a deceptive simplicity and obviousness about some sociological investigations. One reads them, nods at the familiar scene, remarks that one has heard all this before and don&#x2019;t people have better things to do than to waste their time on truisms&#x2014;until one is suddenly brought up against an insight that radically questions everything one had previously assumed about this familiar scene. This is the point at which one begins to sense the excitement of sociology. (Berger, 1963)</p>

          <p id="auto_e13dda45-c995-47e5-8146-0ac7e1015ce6_fs-idm224916624">Sociology can be exciting because it teaches people ways to recognize how they fit into the world and how others perceive them. Looking at themselves and society from a sociological perspective helps people see where they connect to different groups based on the many different ways they classify themselves and how society classifies them in turn. It raises awareness of how those classifications&#x2014;such as economic and status levels, education, ethnicity, or sexual orientation&#x2014;affect perceptions.</p>
          <p id="auto_e13dda45-c995-47e5-8146-0ac7e1015ce6_fs-idm240440384">Sociology teaches people not to accept easy explanations. It teaches them a way to organize their thinking so that they can ask better questions and formulate better answers. It makes people more aware that there are many different kinds of people in the world who do not necessarily think the way they do. It increases their willingness and ability to try to see the world from other people&#x2019;s perspectives. This prepares them to live and work in an increasingly diverse and integrated world.</p>

Besides actually conducting social research or training others in the field, people who graduate from college with a degree in sociology are hired by government agencies and corporations in fields such as social services, counseling (e.g., family planning, career, substance abuse), community planning, health services, marketing, market research, and human resources. Even a small amount of training in sociology can be an asset in careers like sales, public relations, journalism, teaching, law, and criminal justice.</p>

              <p id="auto_e13dda45-c995-47e5-8146-0ac7e1015ce6_fs-idm232412592">You&#x2019;ve probably heard a cautionary story that goes something like this: A high school student spent years working hard, engaging in their community, helping others, and generally growing into a positive and promising young adult. During senior year, they start the college application process, and after a couple of interviews and other interactions, things are looking bright at several of their top choices. But when the time arrives for those fateful notifications about acceptance or rejection, the student and their family are shocked to get rejected from all schools but one. Inquiries from family members and guidance counselors had no results. The only news came in the form of a letter three weeks later from the one school that had accepted the student.</p>
              <p id="auto_e13dda45-c995-47e5-8146-0ac7e1015ce6_fs-idm247543520">&#x201C;...After an initial investigation, the University has determined that several posts attributed to you violate our policies, and are offensive and troubling...&#x201D;</p>
              <p id="auto_e13dda45-c995-47e5-8146-0ac7e1015ce6_fs-idm252860912">The letter&#x2019;s remaining two pages detailed the ongoing investigation and outlined the potential outcomes. But that one statement said it all: The student had posted something offensive on social media, and their prospective colleges had found it.</p>
              <p id="auto_e13dda45-c995-47e5-8146-0ac7e1015ce6_fs-idm246454464">Two years earlier, at the beginning of sophomore year, the student had posted two comments and a meme that mocked a classmate who had been assaulted at a party. Even thought the student had removed them within a few days, the posts lived on in other forums and on a few friends&#x2019; pages; there was also the possibility that someone had screen-grabbed them. While social media posts are protected forms of speech in relation to the government, colleges can review them as they evaluate applicants. Employers can do the same, as can romantic partners or even volunteer organizations.</p>
              <p id="auto_e13dda45-c995-47e5-8146-0ac7e1015ce6_fs-idm253860672">You may believe that a 15-year-old&#x2019;s social media comments should not impact them years later. Or you may feel that someone who jokes about assault may be a risk to commit a similar act or fail to stop or report one. Sociologists may consider all of those assumptions, and may seek answers or information through research to uncover the impacts, risks, tendencies, and outcomes on the different groups involved. For example, a sociologist might work to discover answers to the following questions:</p>
              <ul id="auto_e13dda45-c995-47e5-8146-0ac7e1015ce6_fs-idm262874640">
                <li>Is abusive speech or assault less likely to occur at colleges that screen applicants&#x2019; social media posts?</li>
                <li>Do sensitivity trainings or cultural competency programs have an effect on online speech?</li>
                <li>Do colleges treat all community members equally when they discover someone has posted offensive comments or other content?</li>
                <li>Are algorithms and artificial intelligence used to detect problematic comments biased against certain people or communities?</li>
              </ul>
              <p id="auto_e13dda45-c995-47e5-8146-0ac7e1015ce6_fs-idm237555328">None of these questions could be answered by a single study or even a group of them. But like the Supreme Court&#x2019;s use of Mamie and Kenneth Clarke&#x2019;s research, college administrators, high school counselors, and technology companies can use the outcomes of research and analysis to make decisions or implement programs.</p>

          <p id="auto_c8d9ab4b-dd9c-4dad-aa9f-00bae82cd0af_fs-idm382538640">Sociology is the systematic and scientific study of society and social interaction. In order to carry out their studies, sociologists identify cultural patterns and social forces and determine how they affect individuals and groups. They also develop ways to apply their findings to the real world.</p>

          <p id="auto_5f36c280-1b4c-4abb-9407-61358242bee0_fs-idm377265296">Sociology was developed as an academic and scientific way to study and theorize about the changes to society brought on by the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some of the earliest sociologists thought that societies and individuals&#x2019; roles in society could be studied using the same scientific methodologies that were used in the natural sciences, while others believed that is was impossible to predict human behavior scientifically, and still others debated the value of such predictions. Those perspectives continue to be represented within sociology today.</p>

          <p id="auto_746efd2e-8fb4-4368-98b4-45f6fd33eb27_fs-idm278225200">Sociologists develop theories to explain social events, interactions, and patterns. A theory is a proposed explanation of those social interactions. Theories have different scales. Macro-level theories, such as structural functionalism and conflict theory, attempt to explain how societies operate as a whole. Micro-level theories, such as symbolic interactionism, focus on interactions between individuals.</p>

By studying sociology people learn how to think critically about social issues and problems that confront our society. The study of sociology enriches students&#x2019; lives and prepares them for careers in an increasingly diverse world. Society benefits because people with sociological training are better prepared to make informed decisions about social issues and take effective action to deal with them.</p>

On the evening of February 26, 2012, he was visiting with his father and his father&#x2019;s fianc&#xE9;e in the Sanford, Florida multi-ethnic gated community where his father's fianc&#xE9;e lived. Trayvon went on foot to buy a snack from a nearby convenience store. As he was returning, George Zimmerman, a White Hispanic man and the community&#x2019;s neighborhood watch program coordinator, noticed him. In light of a recent rash of break-ins, Zimmerman called the police to report a person acting suspiciously, which he had done on many other occasions. During the call, Zimmerman said in reference to suspicious people,  "[expletive] punks. Those [expletive], they always get away." The 911 operator told Zimmerman not to follow the teen, as was also stated in the police neighborhood watch guidelines that had been provided to Zimmerman. But Zimmerman did follow the teen, and, soon after, they had a physical confrontation. Several people in the community heard yelling, cries for help, and saw two people on the ground. According to Zimmerman, Martin attacked him, and in the ensuing scuffle, Zimmerman shot and killed Martin (CNN Library 2021).</p>
            <p id="auto_7e6d02f2-9fe9-4696-927b-87b141005478_import-auto-id1498289">A public outcry followed Martin&#x2019;s death. There were allegations of <span data-type="term" id="auto_7e6d02f2-9fe9-4696-927b-87b141005478_term29" group-by="r">racial profiling</span>&#x2014;the use of race alone to determine whether detain or investigate someone. As part of the initial investigation, Zimmerman was extensively interviewed by police, but was released under Florida's "Stand Your Ground" Law, which indicated police could not arrest him for his actions. About six weeks later, Zimmerman was arrested and charged with second-degree murder by a special prosecutor, Angela Corey, who had been appointed by Florida's governor. In the ensuing trial, he was found not guilty (CNN Library 2021).</p>
            <p id="auto_7e6d02f2-9fe9-4696-927b-87b141005478_import-auto-id2627860">The shooting, the public response, and the trial that followed offer a snapshot of the sociology of race. Do you think race played a role in Martin&#x2019;s death? Do you think race had an influence on the initial decision not to arrest Zimmerman, or on his later acquittal? Does society fear Black men, leading to racial profiling at an institutional level?</p>

The idea of race refers to superficial physical differences that a particular society considers significant, while ethnicity describes shared culture. And the term "minority groups" describe groups that are subordinate, or that lack power in society regardless of skin color or country of origin. For example, in modern U.S. history, the elderly might be considered a minority group due to a diminished status that results from popular prejudice and discrimination against them. Ten percent of nursing home staff admitted to physically abusing an elderly person in the past year, and 40 percent admitted to committing psychological abuse (World Health Organization 2011). In this chapter we focus on racial and ethnic minorities.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">What Is Race?</h3>
          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_fs-idm386956032">A human <strong data-effect="bold">race</strong> is a grouping of humankind based on shared physical or social qualities that can vary from one society to another.</p>
          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_fs-idm390075984">Historically, the concept of race has changed across cultures and eras, and has eventually become less connected with ancestral and familial ties, and more concerned with superficial physical characteristics. In the past, theorists developed categories of race based on various geographic regions, ethnicities, skin colors, and more. Their labels for racial groups have connoted regions or skin tones, for example.</p>
          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_fs-idm883787328">German physician, zoologist, and anthropologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752-1840) introduced one of the famous groupings by studying human skulls. Blumenbach divided humans into five races (MacCord 2014):</p>
          <ul id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_import-auto-id129169600">
            <li>Caucasian or White race: people of European, Middle Eastern, and North African origin</li>
            <li>Ethiopian or Black race: people of sub-Saharan Africans origin (sometimes spelled Aethiopian)</li>
            <li>Malayan or Brown race: people of Southeast Asian origin and Pacific Islanders</li>
            <li>Mongolian or Yellow race: people of all East Asian and some Central Asian origin</li>
            <li>American or Red race: people of North American origin or American Indians</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_import-auto-id1161344">Over time, descriptions of race like Blumenbach's have fallen into disuse, and the <span data-type="term" id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_import-auto-id3081454" group-by="s">social construction of race</span> is a more accepted way of understanding racial categories. Social science organizations including the American Association of Anthropologists, the American Sociological Association, and the American Psychological Association have all officially rejected explanations of race like those listed above. Research in this school of thought suggests that race is not biologically identifiable and that previous racial categories were based on pseudoscience; they were often used to justify racist practices (Omi and Winant 1994; Graves 2003). For example, some people used to think that genetics of race determined intelligence. While this idea was mostly put to rest in the later 20th Century, it resurged several times in the past 50 years, including the widely read and cited 1994 book, <em data-effect="italics">The Bell Curve</em>. Researchers have since provided substantial evidence that refutes a biological-racial basis for intelligence, including the widespread closing of IQ gaps as Black people gained more access to education (Dickens 2006). This research and other confirming studies indicate that any generally lower IQ among a racial group was more about <em data-effect="italics">nurture</em> than <em data-effect="italics">nature</em>, to put it into the terms of the Socialization chapter.</p>
          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_fs-idm613486816">While many of the historical considerations of race have been corrected in favor of more accurate and sensitive descriptions, some of the older terms remain. For example, it is generally unacceptable and insulting to refer to Asian people or Native American people with color-based terminology, but it is acceptable to refer to White and Black people in that way. In 2020, a number of publications announced that they would begin capitalizing the names of races, though not everyone used the same approach (Seipel 2020). This practice comes nearly a hundred years after sociologist and leader W.E.B. Du Bois drove newsrooms to capitalize "Negro," the widely used term at the time. And, finally, some members of racial groups (or ethnic groups, which are described below) "reclaim" terms previously used to insult them (Rao 2018). These examples are more evidence of the social construction of race, and our evolving relationships among people and groups.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">What Is Ethnicity?</h3>
          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_import-auto-id2364915">Ethnicity is sometimes used interchangeably with race, but they are very different concepts. <span data-type="term" id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_term31" group-by="E">Ethnicity</span> is based on shared culture&#x2014;the practices, norms, values, and beliefs of a group that might include shared language, religion, and traditions, among other commonalities. Like race, the term ethnicity is difficult to describe and its meaning has changed over time. And as with race, individuals may be identified or self-identify with ethnicities in complex, even contradictory, ways. For example, ethnic groups such as Irish, Italian American, Russian, Jewish, and Serbian might all be groups whose members are predominantly included in the &#x201C;White&#x201D; racial category. Ethnicity, like race, continues to be an identification method that individuals and institutions use today&#x2014;whether through the census, diversity initiatives, nondiscrimination laws, or simply in personal day-to-day relations.</p>
          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_fs-idm384266896">In some cases, ethnicity is incorrectly used as a synonym for national origin, but those constructions are technically different. National origin (itself sometimes confused with nationality) has to do with the geographic and political associations with a person's birthplace or residence. But people from a nation can be of a wide range of ethnicities, often unknown to people outside of the region, which leads to misconceptions. For example, someone in the United States may, with no ill-intent, refer to all Vietnamese people as an ethnic group. But Vietnam is home to 54 formally recognized ethnic groups.</p>
          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_fs-idm339222160">Adding to the complexity: Sometimes, either to build bridges between ethnic groups, promote civil rights, gain recognition, or other reasons, diverse but closely associated ethnic groups may develop a "pan-ethnic" group. For example, the various ethnic groups and national origins of people from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and adjoining nations, who may share cultural, linguistic, or other values, may group themselves together in a collective identity. If they do so, they may not seek to erase their individual ethnicities, but finding the correct description and association can be challenging and depend on context. The large number of people who make up the Asian American community may embrace their collective identity in the context of the United States. However, that embrace may depend on people's ages, and may be expressed differently when speaking to different populations (Park 2008). For example, someone who identifies as Asian American while at home in Houston may not refer to themselves as such when they visit extended family in Japan. In a similar manner, a grouping of people from Mexico, Central America and South America&#x2014;often referred to as Latinx, Latina, or Latino&#x2014;may be embraced by some and rejected by others in the group (Martinez 2019).</p>

          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_import-auto-id2095138">Sociologist Louis Wirth (1945) defined a <span data-type="term" id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_import-auto-id2653190" group-by="m">minority group</span> as &#x201C;any group of people who, because of their physical or cultural characteristics, are singled out from the others in the society in which they live for differential and unequal treatment, and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination.&#x201D; The term minority connotes discrimination, and in its sociological use, the term <span data-type="term" id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_import-auto-id1397324" group-by="s">subordinate group</span> can be used interchangeably with the term minority group, while the term <span data-type="term" id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_import-auto-id1555353" group-by="d">dominant group</span> is often substituted for the group that represents rulers or is in the majority who can access power and privilege in a given society. These definitions correlate to the concept that the dominant group is that which holds the most power in a given society, while subordinate groups are those who lack power compared to the dominant group.</p>
          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_import-auto-id1284051">Note that being a numerical minority is not a characteristic of being a minority group; sometimes larger groups can be considered minority groups due to their lack of power. It is the lack of power that is the predominant characteristic of a minority, or subordinate group. For example, consider apartheid in South Africa, in which a numerical majority (the Black inhabitants of the country) were exploited and oppressed by the White minority.</p>
          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_import-auto-id3654783">According to Charles Wagley and Marvin Harris (1958), a minority group is distinguished by five characteristics: (1) unequal treatment and less power over their lives, (2) distinguishing physical or cultural traits like skin color or language, (3) involuntary membership in the group, (4) awareness of subordination, and (5) high rate of in-group marriage. Additional examples of minority groups might include the LBGTQ community, religious practitioners whose faith is not widely practiced where they live, and people with disabilities.</p>

History has shown us many examples of the scapegoating of a subordinate group. An example from the last century is the way Adolf Hitler blamed the Jewish population for Germany&#x2019;s social and economic problems. In the United States, recent immigrants have frequently been the scapegoat for the nation&#x2019;s&#x2014;or an individual&#x2019;s&#x2014;woes. Many states have enacted laws to disenfranchise immigrants; these laws are popular because they let the dominant group scapegoat a subordinate group.</p>

          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_import-auto-id1376264">Prior to the twentieth century, racial intermarriage (referred to as miscegenation) was extremely rare, and in many places, illegal. While the sexual subordination of enslaved people did result in children of mixed race, these children were usually considered Black, and therefore, property. There was no concept of multiple racial identities with the possible exception of the Creole. Creole society developed in the port city of New Orleans, where a mixed-race culture grew from French and African inhabitants. Unlike in other parts of the country, &#x201C;Creoles of color&#x201D; had greater social, economic, and educational opportunities than most African Americans.</p>
          <p id="auto_ef3b2aab-ce5b-4b35-9ec7-7f588cf76737_import-auto-id2626376">Increasingly during the modern era, the removal of miscegenation laws and a trend toward equal rights and legal protection against racism have steadily reduced the social stigma attached to racial exogamy (exogamy refers to marriage outside a person&#x2019;s core social unit). It is now common for the children of racially mixed parents to acknowledge and celebrate their various ethnic identities. Golfer Tiger Woods, for instance, has Chinese, Thai, African American, Native American, and Dutch heritage; he jokingly refers to his ethnicity as &#x201C;Cablinasian,&#x201D; a term he coined to combine several of his ethnic backgrounds. While this is the trend, it is not yet evident in all aspects of our society. For example, the U.S. Census only recently added additional categories for people to identify themselves, such as non-White Hispanic. A growing number of people chose multiple races to describe themselves on the 2020 Census, indicating that individuals have multiple identities.</p>

          <p id="auto_0edbeb4e-db80-4e63-afeb-e3b7448fe175_import-auto-id2276151">We can examine race and ethnicity through three major sociological perspectives: functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism. As you read through these theories, ask yourself which one makes the most sense and why.</p>
          <section data-depth="2" id="auto_0edbeb4e-db80-4e63-afeb-e3b7448fe175_fs-id2747429">
            <h4 data-type="title">Functionalism</h4>
            <p id="auto_0edbeb4e-db80-4e63-afeb-e3b7448fe175_fs-idm656288160">Functionalism emphasizes that all the elements of society have functions that promote solidarity and maintain order and stability in society. Hence, we can observe people from various racial and ethnic backgrounds interacting harmoniously in a state of social balance. Problems arise when one or more racial or ethnic groups experience inequalities and discriminations. This creates tension and conflict resulting in temporary dysfunction of the social system. For example, the killing of a Black man George Floyd by a White police officer in 2020 stirred up protests demanding racial justice and changes in policing in the United States. To restore the society&#x2019;s pre-disturbed state or to seek a new equilibrium, the police department and various parts of the system require changes and compensatory adjustments.</p>
            <p id="auto_0edbeb4e-db80-4e63-afeb-e3b7448fe175_eip-979">Another way to apply the functionalist perspective to race and ethnicity is to discuss the way racism can contribute positively to the functioning of society by strengthening bonds between in-group members through the ostracism of out-group members.  Consider how a community might increase solidarity by refusing to allow outsiders access. On the other hand, Rose (1951) suggested that dysfunctions associated with racism include the failure to take advantage of talent in the subjugated group, and that society must divert from other purposes the time and effort needed to maintain artificially constructed racial boundaries. Consider how much money, time, and effort went toward maintaining separate and unequal educational systems prior to the civil rights movement.</p>
            <p id="auto_0edbeb4e-db80-4e63-afeb-e3b7448fe175_fs-idm349049088">In the view of functionalism, racial and ethnic inequalities must have served an important function in order to exist as long as they have. This concept, sometimes, can be problematic. How can racism and discrimination contribute positively to society? Nash (1964) focused his argument on the way racism is functional for the dominant group, for example, suggesting that racism morally justifies a racially unequal society. Consider the way slave owners justified slavery in the antebellum South, by suggesting Black people were fundamentally inferior to White and preferred slavery to freedom.</p>

            <p id="auto_0edbeb4e-db80-4e63-afeb-e3b7448fe175_fs-idm395603776">For symbolic interactionists, race and ethnicity provide strong symbols as sources of identity. In fact, some interactionists propose that the symbols of race, not race itself, are what lead to racism. Famed Interactionist Herbert Blumer (1958) suggested that racial prejudice is formed through interactions between members of the dominant group: Without these interactions, individuals in the dominant group would not hold racist views. These interactions contribute to an abstract picture of the subordinate group that allows the dominant group to support its view of the subordinate group, and thus maintains the status quo. An example of this might be an individual whose beliefs about a particular group are based on images conveyed in popular media, and those are unquestionably believed because the individual has never personally met a member of that group.</p>
            <p id="auto_0edbeb4e-db80-4e63-afeb-e3b7448fe175_fs-idm630087376">Another way to apply the interactionist perspective is to look at how people define their races and the race of others. As we discussed in relation to the social construction of race, since some people who claim a White identity have a greater amount of skin pigmentation than some people who claim a Black identity, how did they come to define themselves as Black or White?</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">Conflict Theory</h4>
            <p id="auto_0edbeb4e-db80-4e63-afeb-e3b7448fe175_import-auto-id1460603">Conflict theories are often applied to inequalities of gender, social class, education, race, and ethnicity. A conflict theory perspective of U.S. history would examine the numerous past and current struggles between the White ruling class and racial and ethnic minorities, noting specific conflicts that have arisen when the dominant group perceived a threat from the minority group. In the late nineteenth century, the rising power of Black Americans after the Civil War resulted in draconian Jim Crow laws that severely limited Black political and social power. For example, Vivien Thomas (1910&#x2013;1985), the Black surgical technician who helped develop the groundbreaking surgical technique that saves the lives of &#x201C;blue babies&#x201D; was classified as a janitor for many years, and paid as such, despite the fact that he was conducting complicated surgical experiments. The years since the Civil War have showed a pattern of attempted disenfranchisement, with gerrymandering and voter suppression efforts aimed at predominantly minority neighborhoods.</p>

            <p id="auto_0edbeb4e-db80-4e63-afeb-e3b7448fe175_import-auto-id1460848">Feminist sociologist Patricia Hill Collins (1990) further developed <span data-type="term" id="auto_0edbeb4e-db80-4e63-afeb-e3b7448fe175_term36" group-by="i">intersection theory</span>, originally articulated in 1989 by Kimberl&#xE9; Crenshaw, which suggests we cannot separate the effects of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and other attributes (Figure 11.4). When we examine race and how it can bring us both advantages and disadvantages, it is important to acknowledge that the way we experience race is shaped, for example, by our gender and class. Multiple layers of disadvantage intersect to create the way we experience race. For example, if we want to understand prejudice, we must understand that the prejudice focused on a White woman because of her gender is very different from the layered prejudice focused on an Asian woman in poverty, who is affected by stereotypes related to being poor, being a woman, and her ethnic status.</p>

Because we are all exposed to these images and thoughts, it is impossible to know to what extent they have influenced our thought processes.</p>

Stereotypes can be based on race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation&#x2014;almost any characteristic. They may be positive (usually about one&#x2019;s own group) but are often negative (usually toward other groups, such as when members of a dominant racial group suggest that a subordinate racial group is stupid or lazy). In either case, the stereotype is a generalization that doesn&#x2019;t take individual differences into account.</p>
        <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_import-auto-id1304707">Where do stereotypes come from? In fact, new stereotypes are rarely created; rather, they are recycled from subordinate groups that have assimilated into society and are reused to describe newly subordinate groups. For example, many stereotypes that are currently used to characterize new immigrants were used earlier in American history to characterize Irish and Eastern European immigrants. </p>

A prejudice is not based on personal experience; instead, it is a prejudgment, originating outside actual experience. Recall from the chapter on Crime and Deviance that the criminalization of marijuana was based on anti-immigrant sentiment; proponents used fictional, fear-instilling stories of "reefer madness" and rampant immoral and illegal activities among Spanish-speaking people to justify new laws and harsh treatment of marijuana users. Many people who supported criminalizing marijuana had never met any of the new immigrants who were rumored to use it; the ideas were based in prejudice.</p>
          <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm375892224">While prejudice is based in beliefs outside of experience, experience can lead people to feel that their prejudice is confirmed or justified. This is a type of confirmation bias. For example, if someone is taught to believe that a certain ethnic group has negative attributes, every negative act committed someone in that group can be seen as confirming the prejudice. Even a minor social offense committed by a member of the ethnic group, like crossing the street outside the crosswalk or talking too loudly on a bus, could confirm the prejudice.</p>
          <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm412436592">While prejudice often originates outside experience, it isn't instinctive. Prejudice&#x2014;as well as the stereotypes that lead to it and the discrimination that stems from it&#x2014;is most often taught and learned. The teaching arrives in many forms, from direct instruction or indoctrination, to observation and socialization. Movies, books, charismatic speakers, and even a desire to impress others can all support the development of prejudices.</p>

They are also subject to confirmation bias, in which any bit of supporting evidence gives a person more confidence in their belief. For example, if you think older people are bad drivers, every time you see an accident involving an older driver, it's likely to increase your confidence in your stereotype. Even if you hear the statistics that younger drivers cause more accidents than older drivers, the fulfillment of your stereotype is difficult to overcome. (Credit: Chris Freser/flickr)</span>

Discrimination can be based on race, ethnicity, age, religion, health, and other categories. For example, discrimination based on race or ethnicity can take many forms, from unfair housing practices such as redlining to biased hiring systems. Overt discrimination has long been part of U.S. history. In the late nineteenth century, it was not uncommon for business owners to hang signs that read, "Help Wanted: No Irish Need Apply." And southern Jim Crow laws, with their "Whites Only" signs, exemplified overt discrimination that is not tolerated today.</p>
          <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_eip-id1170349782827">Discrimination also manifests in different ways. The scenarios above are examples of individual discrimination, but other types exist. Institutional discrimination occurs when a societal system has developed with embedded disenfranchisement of a group, such as the U.S. military's historical nonacceptance of minority sexualities (the "don't ask, don't tell" policy reflected this norm).</p>
          <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm382434576">While the form and severity of discrimination vary significantly, they are considered forms of oppression. Institutional discrimination can also include the promotion of a group's status, such in the case of privilege, which is the benefits people receive simply by being part of the dominant group.</p>
          <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_eip-604">Most people have some level of privilege, whether it has to do with health, ability, race, or gender. When discussing race, the focus is often on <span data-type="term" id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_term41" group-by="W">White privilege</span>, which are the benefits people receive by being a White person or being perceived to be a White person.
Most White people are willing to admit that non-White people live with a set of disadvantages due to the color of their skin. But until they gain a good degree of self-awareness, few people are willing to acknowledge the benefits they themselves receive by being a part of the dominant group. Why not? Some may feel it lessens their accomplishments, others may feel a degree of guilt, and still others may feel that admitting to privilege makes them seem like a bad or mean person. But White (or other dominant) privilege is an institutional condition, not a personal one. It exists whether the person asks for it or not. In fact, a pioneering thinker on the topic, Peggy McIntosh, noted that she didn't recognize privilege because, in fact, it was not based in meanness. Instead, it was an "invisible weightless knapsack full of special provisions" that she didn't ask for, yet from which she still benefitted (McIntosh 1989). As the reference indicates, McIntosh's first major publication about White privilege was released in 1989; many people have only become familiar with the term in recent years.</p>
          <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm414432160">Prejudice and discrimination can overlap and intersect in many ways. To illustrate, here are four examples of how prejudice and discrimination can occur. Unprejudiced nondiscriminators are open-minded, tolerant, and accepting individuals. Unprejudiced discriminators might be those who unthinkingly practice sexism in their workplace by not considering women or gender nonconforming people for certain positions that have traditionally been held by men. Prejudiced nondiscriminators are those who hold racist beliefs but don't act on them, such as a racist store owner who serves minority customers. Prejudiced discriminators include those who actively make disparaging remarks about others or who perpetuate hate crimes.</p>

Systemic racism occurs in organizations as discriminatory treatments and unfair policies based on race that result in inequitable outcomes for White people over people of color. For example, a school system where students of color are distributed into underfunded schools and out of the higher-resourced schools.</li>

The disparate treatment of racial minorities by law enforcement officials is a common example of racial profiling in the United States. For example, a study on the Driver's License Privilege to All Minnesota Residents from 2008 to 2010 found that the percentage of Latinos arrested was disproportionally high (Feist 2013). Similarly, the disproportionate number of Black men arrested, charged, and convicted of crimes reflect racial profiling.</li>

For example, the European culture is considered supposedly more mature, evolved and rational than other cultures (Blaut 1992). A study showed that White and Asian American students with high GPAs experience greater social acceptance while Black and Native American students with high GPAs are rejected by their peers (Fuller-Rowell and Doan 2010).</li>

For example, if an employer believes a Black employee with a darker skin tone is less capable than a Black employee with lighter skin tone, that is colorism. Studies suggest that darker skinned African Americans experience more discrimination than lighter skinned African Americans (Herring, Keith, and Horton 2004; Klonoff and Landrine 2000).</li>

The U.S. cultural narrative that typically focuses on individual racism fails to recognize systemic racism. It has arisen since the post-Civil Rights era and supports racism while avoiding any reference to race (Bonilla-Silva (2015).</li>

          <h3 data-type="title">How to Be an Antiracist</h3>
          <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm394618464">Almost all mainstream voices in the United States oppose racism. Despite this, racism is prevalent in several forms. For example, when a newspaper uses people's race to identify individuals accused of a crime, it may enhance stereotypes of a certain minority. Another example of racist practices is <span data-type="term" id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_term51" group-by="r">racial steering</span>, in which real estate agents direct prospective homeowners toward or away from certain neighborhoods based on their race.</p>
          <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm414389728">Racist attitudes and beliefs are often more insidious and harder to pin down than specific racist practices. They become more complex due to implicit bias (also referred to as unconscious bias) which is the process of associating stereotypes or attitudes towards categories of people without conscious awareness &#x2013; which can result in unfair actions and decisions that are at odds with one&#x2019;s conscious beliefs about fairness and equality (Osta and Vasquez 2021). For example, in schools we often see &#x201C;honors&#x201D; and &#x201C;gifted&#x201D; classes quickly filled with White students while the majority of Black and Latino students are placed in the lower track classes. As a result, our mind consciously and unconsciously starts to associate Black and Latino students with being less intelligent, less capable. Osta and Vasquez (2021) argue that placing the student of color into a lower and less rigorous track, we reproduce the inequity and the vicious cycle of structural racism and implicit bias continues.</p>

          <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm410135504">If everyone becomes antiracist, breaking the vicious cycle of structural racism and implicit bias may not be far away. To be antiracist is a radical choice in the face of history, requiring a radical reorientation of our consciousness (Kendi 2019). Proponents of anti-racism indicate that we must work collaboratively within ourselves, our institutions, and our networks to challenge racism at local, national and global levels. The practice of anti-racism is everyone&#x2019;s ongoing work that everyone should pursue at least the following (Carter and Snyder 2020):</p>
          <ul id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm389492704">
            <li>Understand and own the racist ideas in which we have been socialized and the racist biases that these ideas have created within each of us.</li>
            <li>Identify racist policies, practices, and procedures and replace them with antiracist policies, practices, and procedures.</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm403145520">Anti-racism need not be confrontational in the sense of engaging in direct arguments with people, feeling terrible about your privilege, or denying your own needs or success. In fact, many people who are a part of a minority acknowledge the need for allies from the dominant group (Melaku 2020). Understanding and owning the racist ideas, and recognizing your own privilege, is a good and brave thing.</p>
          <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm377321872">We cannot erase racism simply by enacting laws to abolish it, because it is embedded in our complex reality that relates to educational, economic, criminal, political, and other social systems. Importantly, everyone can become antiracist by making conscious choices daily. Being racist or antiracist is not about who you are; it is about what you do (Carter and Snyder 2020).</p>

            <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm382266672">The death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9, 2014 illustrates racial tensions in the United States as well as the overlap between prejudice, discrimination, and institutional racism. On that day, Brown, a young unarmed Black man, was killed by a White police officer named Darren Wilson. During the incident, Wilson directed Brown and his friend to walk on the sidewalk instead of in the street. While eyewitness accounts vary, they agree that an altercation occurred between Wilson and Brown. Wilson&#x2019;s version has him shooting Brown in self-defense after Brown assaulted him, while Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown also present at the time, claimed that Brown first ran away, then turned with his hands in the air to surrender, after which Wilson shot him repeatedly (Nobles and Bosman 2014). Three autopsies independently confirmed that Brown was shot six times (Lowery and Fears 2014).</p>
            <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm407323264">The shooting focused attention on a number of race-related tensions in the United States. First, members of the predominantly Black community viewed Brown&#x2019;s death as the result of a White police officer racially profiling a Black man (Nobles and Bosman 2014). In the days after, it was revealed that only three members of the town&#x2019;s fifty-three-member police force were Black (Nobles and Bosman 2014). The national dialogue shifted during the next few weeks, with some commentators pointing to a nationwide <span data-type="term" id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_term52" group-by="s">sedimentation of racial inequality</span> and identifying redlining in Ferguson as a cause of the unbalanced racial composition in the community, in local political establishments, and in the police force (Bouie 2014). <span data-type="term" id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_term53" group-by="R">Redlining</span> is the practice of routinely refusing mortgages for households and businesses located in predominately minority communities, while sedimentation of racial inequality describes the intergenerational impact of both practical and legalized racism that limits the abilities of Black people to accumulate wealth.</p>
            <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_eip-id1166253163463">Ferguson&#x2019;s racial imbalance may explain in part why, even though in 2010 only about 63 percent of its population was Black, in 2013 Black people were detained in 86 percent of stops, 92 percent of searches, and 93 percent of arrests (Missouri Attorney General&#x2019;s Office 2014). In addition, <span data-type="term" id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_term54" group-by="d">de facto segregation</span> in Ferguson&#x2019;s schools, a race-based wealth gap, urban sprawl, and a Black unemployment rate three times that of the White unemployment rate worsened existing racial tensions in Ferguson while also reflecting nationwide racial inequalities (Bouie 2014).</p>
            <p id="auto_e207a1bd-229d-435d-b2be-feb218954337_fs-idm661955536">This situation has not much changed in the United States. After Michael Brown, dozens of unarmed Black people have been shot and killed by police. Studies find no change to the racial disparity in the use of deadly force by police (Belli 2020).  Do you think that racial tension can be reduced by stopping police action against racial minorities? What types of policies and practices are important to reduce racial tension? Who are responsible? Why?</p>

In the decades since then, further waves of immigrants have come to these shores and have eventually been absorbed into U.S. culture, sometimes after facing extended periods of prejudice and discrimination. Assimilation may lead to the loss of the minority group&#x2019;s cultural identity as they become absorbed into the dominant culture, but assimilation has minimal to no impact on the majority group&#x2019;s cultural identity.</p>
          <p id="auto_05938a47-b4e3-4e5d-91f4-7d702ecbf185_import-auto-id2195638">Some groups may keep only symbolic gestures of their original ethnicity. For instance, many Irish Americans may celebrate Saint Patrick&#x2019;s Day, many Hindu Americans enjoy a Diwali festival, and many Mexican Americans may celebrate <em data-effect="italics">Cinco de Mayo</em> (a May 5 acknowledgment of the Mexican victory over the French Empire at the Battle of Puebla). However, for the rest of the year, other aspects of their originating culture may be forgotten.</p>
          <p id="auto_05938a47-b4e3-4e5d-91f4-7d702ecbf185_import-auto-id1673297">Assimilation is antithetical to the &#x201C;salad bowl&#x201D; created by pluralism; rather than maintaining their own cultural flavor, subordinate cultures give up their own traditions in order to conform to their new environment. Sociologists measure the degree to which immigrants have assimilated to a new culture with four benchmarks: socioeconomic status, spatial concentration, language assimilation, and intermarriage. When faced with racial and ethnic discrimination, it can be difficult for new immigrants to fully assimilate. Language assimilation, in particular, can be a formidable barrier, limiting employment and educational options and therefore constraining growth in socioeconomic status.</p>

Amalgamation creates the classic &#x201C;melting pot&#x201D; analogy; unlike the &#x201C;salad bowl,&#x201D; in which each culture retains its individuality, the &#x201C;melting pot&#x201D; ideal sees the combination of cultures that results in a new culture entirely.</p>

Historically, we can see that genocide has included both the intent to exterminate a group and the function of exterminating of a group, intentional or not.</p>
          <p id="auto_05938a47-b4e3-4e5d-91f4-7d702ecbf185_import-auto-id2015556">Possibly the most well-known case of genocide is Hitler&#x2019;s attempt to exterminate the Jewish people in the first part of the twentieth century. Also known as the Holocaust, the explicit goal of Hitler&#x2019;s &#x201C;Final Solution&#x201D; was the eradication of European Jewry, as well as the destruction of other minority groups such as Catholics, people with disabilities, and homosexuals. With forced emigration, concentration camps, and mass executions in gas chambers, Hitler&#x2019;s Nazi regime was responsible for the deaths of 12 million people, 6 million of whom were Jewish. Hitler&#x2019;s intent was clear, and the high Jewish death toll certainly indicates that Hitler and his regime committed genocide. But how do we understand genocide that is not so overt and deliberate?</p>
          <p id="auto_05938a47-b4e3-4e5d-91f4-7d702ecbf185_import-auto-id2109693">The treatment of the Native Americans by the European colonizers is an example of genocide committed against indigenous people. Some historians estimate that Native American populations dwindled from approximately 12 million people in the year 1500 to barely 237,000 by the year 1900 (Lewy 2004). European settlers coerced American Indians off their own lands, often causing thousands of deaths in forced removals, such as occurred in the Cherokee or Potawatomi Trail of Tears. Settlers also enslaved Native Americans and forced them to give up their religious and cultural practices. But the major cause of Native American death was neither slavery nor war nor forced removal: it was the introduction of European diseases and Indians&#x2019; lack of immunity to them. Smallpox, diphtheria, and measles flourished among indigenous American tribes who had no exposure to the diseases and no ability to fight them. Quite simply, these diseases decimated the tribes. How planned this genocide was remains a topic of contention. Some argue that the spread of disease was an unintended effect of conquest, while others believe it was intentional, citing rumors of smallpox-infected blankets being distributed as &#x201C;gifts&#x201D; to tribes.</p>
          <p id="auto_05938a47-b4e3-4e5d-91f4-7d702ecbf185_import-auto-id1416189">Genocide is not a just a historical concept; it is practiced even in the twenty- first century. For example, ethnic and geographic conflicts in the Darfur region of Sudan have led to hundreds of thousands of deaths. As part of an ongoing land conflict, the Sudanese government and their state-sponsored Janjaweed militia have led a campaign of killing, forced displacement, and systematic rape of Darfuri people. Although a treaty was signed in 2011, the peace is fragile.</p>

As seen in the examples of the Trail of Tears and the Holocaust, expulsion can be a factor in genocide. However, it can also stand on its own as a destructive group interaction. Expulsion has often occurred historically with an ethnic or racial basis. In the United States, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 in 1942, after the Japanese government&#x2019;s attack on Pearl Harbor. The Order authorized the establishment of internment camps for anyone with as little as one-eighth Japanese ancestry (i.e., one great-grandparent who was Japanese). Over 120,000 legal Japanese residents and Japanese U.S. citizens, many of them children, were held in these camps for up to four years, despite the fact that there was never any evidence of collusion or espionage. (In fact, many Japanese Americans continued to demonstrate their loyalty to the United States by serving in the U.S. military during the War.) In the 1990s, the U.S. executive branch issued a formal apology for this expulsion; reparation efforts continue today.</p>

It is important to distinguish between <em data-effect="italics">de jure</em> segregation (segregation that is enforced by law) and <em data-effect="italics">de facto</em> segregation (segregation that occurs without laws but because of other factors). A stark example of <em data-effect="italics">de jure</em> segregation is the apartheid movement of South Africa, which existed from 1948 to 1994. Under apartheid, Black South Africans were stripped of their civil rights and forcibly relocated to areas that segregated them physically from their White compatriots.

It wasn&#x2019;t until 1954 and the <em data-effect="italics">Brown v.

Segregation is still alive and well in the United States, with different racial or ethnic groups often segregated by neighborhood, borough, or parish. Sociologists use segregation indices to measure racial segregation of different races in different areas. The indices employ a scale from zero to 100, where zero is the most integrated and 100 is the least. In the New York metropolitan area, for instance, the Black-White segregation index was seventy-nine for the years 2005&#x2013;2009. This means that 79 percent of either Black or White people would have to move in order for each neighborhood to have the same racial balance as the whole metro region (Population Studies Center 2010).</p>

While the first wave of immigrants came from Western Europe, eventually the bulk of people entering North America were from Northern Europe, then Eastern Europe, then Latin America and Asia. And let us not forget the forced immigration of enslaved Africans. Most of these groups underwent a period of disenfranchisement in which they were relegated to the bottom of the social hierarchy before they managed (for those who could) to achieve social mobility. Because of this achievement, the U.S. is still a &#x201C;dream destination&#x201D; for millions of people living in other countries. Many thousands of people, including children, arrive here every year both documented and undocumented. Most Americans welcome and support new immigrants wholeheartedly. For example, the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act introduced in 2001 provides a means for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children to gain a pathway to permanent legal status. Similarly, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) introduced in 2012 gives young undocumented immigrants a work permit and protection from deportation (Georgetown Law 2021). Today, the U.S. society is multicultural, multiracial and multiethnic that is composed of people from several national origins.</p>

These data are based on self-identification; generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country that include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as &#x201C;American Indian&#x201D; and &#x201C;White.&#x201D; People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race. OMB requires five minimum categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.

According to the National Congress of American Indians, Native Americans are &#x201C;All Native people of the United States and its trust territories (i.e., American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Chamorros, and American Samoans), as well as persons from Canadian First Nations and Indigenous communities in Mexico and Central and South America who are U.S. residents (NCAI 2020, p. 11).&#x201D; Native Americans once numbered in the millions but by 2010 made up only 0.9 percent of U.S. populace; see above (U.S. Census 2010). Currently, about 2.9 million people identify themselves as Native American alone, while an additional 2.3 million identify themselves as Native American mixed with another ethnic group (Norris, Vines, and Hoeffel 2012).</p>

These names arise from historically prejudiced views of Native Americans as fierce, brave, and strong: attributes that would be beneficial to a sports team, but are not necessarily beneficial to people in the United States who should be seen as more than that.</p>

The campaign has met with limited success. While some teams have changed their names, hundreds of professional, college, and K&#x2013;12 school teams still have names derived from this stereotype. Another group, American Indian Cultural Support (AICS), is especially concerned with the use of such names at K&#x2013;12 schools, influencing children when they should be gaining a fuller and more realistic understanding of Native Americans than such stereotypes supply.</p>

Mistakenly believing that he had landed in the East Indies, Columbus named the indigenous people &#x201C;Indians,&#x201D; a name that has persisted for centuries despite being a geographical misnomer and one used to blanket hundreds of sovereign tribal nations (NCAI 2020).</p>

As discussed in the section on genocide, the effect of European settlement of the Americans was to nearly destroy the indigenous population. And although Native Americans&#x2019; lack of immunity to European diseases caused the most deaths, overt mistreatment and massacres of Native Americans by Europeans were devastating as well.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id1754699">From the first Spanish colonists to the French, English, and Dutch who followed, European settlers took what land they wanted and expanded across the continent at will. If indigenous people tried to retain their stewardship of the land, Europeans fought them off with superior weapons. Europeans&#x2019; domination of the Americas was indeed a conquest; one scholar points out that Native Americans are the only minority group in the United States whose subordination occurred purely through conquest by the dominant group (Marger 1993).</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id2617729">After the establishment of the United States government, discrimination against Native Americans was codified and formalized in a series of laws intended to subjugate them and keep them from gaining any power. Some of the most impactful laws are as follows:</p>
            <ul id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_fs-id2228549">
              <li>The Indian Removal Act of 1830 forced the relocation of any Native tribes east of the Mississippi River to lands west of the river.</li>
              <li>The Indian Appropriation Acts funded further removals and declared that no Indian tribe could be recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or power with which the U.S. government would have to make treaties. This made it even easier for the U.S. government to take land it wanted.</li>
              <li>The Dawes Act of 1887 reversed the policy of isolating Native Americans on reservations, instead forcing them onto individual properties that were intermingled with White settlers, thereby reducing their capacity for power as a group.</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id2080202">Native American culture was further eroded by the establishment of boarding schools in the late nineteenth century. These schools, run by both Christian missionaries and the United States government, had the express purpose of &#x201C;civilizing&#x201D; Native American children and assimilating them into White society. The boarding schools were located off-reservation to ensure that children were separated from their families and culture. Schools forced children to cut their hair, speak English, and practice Christianity. Physical and sexual abuses were rampant for decades; only in 1987 did the Bureau of Indian Affairs issue a policy on sexual abuse in boarding schools. Some scholars argue that many of the problems that Native Americans face today result from almost a century of mistreatment at these boarding schools.</p>

The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 guaranteed Indian tribes most of the rights of the United States Bill of Rights. New laws like the Indian Self-Determination Act of 1975 and the Education Assistance Act of the same year recognized tribal governments and gave them more power. Indian boarding schools have dwindled to only a few, and Native American cultural groups are striving to preserve and maintain old traditions to keep them from being lost forever. Today, Native Americans are citizens of three sovereigns: their tribal nations, the United States, and the state in which they reside (NCAI 2020).</p>

Long-term poverty, inadequate education, cultural dislocation, and high rates of unemployment contribute to Native American populations falling to the bottom of the economic spectrum. Native Americans also suffer disproportionately with lower life expectancies than most groups in the United States.</p>

A Dutch sea captain brought the first Africans to the Virginia colony of Jamestown in 1619 and sold them as indentured servants. (Indentured servants are people who are committed to work for a certain period of time, typically without formal pay). This was not an uncommon practice for either Black or White people, and indentured servants were in high demand. For the next century, Black and White indentured servants worked side by side. But the growing agricultural economy demanded greater and cheaper labor, and by 1705, Virginia passed the slave codes declaring that any foreign-born non-Christian could be enslaved, and that enslaved people were considered property.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id1375408">The next 150 years saw the rise of U.S. slavery, with Black Africans being kidnapped from their own lands and shipped to the New World on the trans-Atlantic journey known as the Middle Passage. Once in the Americas, the Black population grew until U.S.-born Black people outnumbered those born in Africa. But colonial (and later, U.S.) slave codes declared that the child of an enslaved person was also an enslaved person, so the slave class was created. By 1808, the slave trade was internal in the United States, with enslaved people being bought and sold across state lines like livestock.</p>

In order to justify their severely discriminatory behavior, slaveholders and their supporters viewed Black people as innately inferior. Enslaved people were denied even the most basic rights of citizenship, a crucial factor for slaveholders and their supporters. Slavery poses an excellent example of conflict theory&#x2019;s perspective on race relations; the dominant group needed complete control over the subordinate group in order to maintain its power. Whippings, executions, rapes, and denial of schooling and health care were widely practiced.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id982746">Slavery eventually became an issue over which the nation divided into geographically and ideologically distinct factions, leading to the Civil War. And while the abolition of slavery on moral grounds was certainly a catalyst to war, it was not the only driving force. Students of U.S. history will know that the institution of slavery was crucial to the Southern economy, whose production of crops like rice, cotton, and tobacco relied on the virtually limitless and cheap labor that slavery provided. In contrast, the North didn&#x2019;t benefit economically from slavery, resulting in an economic disparity tied to racial/political issues.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id889550">A century later, the civil rights movement was characterized by boycotts, marches, sit-ins, and freedom rides: demonstrations by a subordinate group and their supporters that would no longer willingly submit to domination. The major blow to America&#x2019;s formally institutionalized racism was the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This Act, which is still important today, banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</p>

The National Urban League&#x2019;s <em data-effect="italics">2020 Equality Index</em> reports that Black people&#x2019;s overall equality level with White people has been generally improving. Measuring standards of civic engagement, economics, education, and others, Black people had an equality level of 71 percent in 2010 and had an equality level of 74 percent in 2020. The <em data-effect="italics">Index</em>, which has been published since 2005, notes a growing trend of increased inequality with White people, especially in the areas of unemployment, insurance coverage, and incarceration. Black people also trail White people considerably in the areas of economics, health, and education (National Urban League 2020).</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id2784245">To what degree do racism and prejudice contribute to this continued inequality? The answer is complex. 2008 saw the election of this country&#x2019;s first African American president: Barack Obama. Despite being popularly identified as Black, we should note that President Obama is of a mixed background that is equally White, and although all presidents have been publicly mocked at times (Gerald Ford was depicted as a klutz, Bill Clinton as someone who could not control his libido), a startling percentage of the critiques of Obama were based on his race. In a number of other chapters, we discuss racial disparities in healthcare, education, incarceration, and other areas.</p>

Black Lives Matter (BLM), an organization founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, was a core part of the movement to protest the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black victims of police violence. Millions of people from all racial backgrounds participated in the movement directly or indirectly, demanding justice for the victims and their families, redistributing police department funding to drive more holistic and community-driven law enforcement, addressing systemic racism, and introducing new laws to punish police officers who kill innocent people.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_fs-idm387091072">The racial justice movement has been able to achieve some these demands. For example, Minneapolis City Council unanimously approved $27 million settlement to the family of George Floyd in March 2021, the largest pre-trial settlement in a wrongful death case ever for the life of a Black person (Shapiro and Lloyd, 2021). $500,000 from the settlement amount is intended to enhance the business district in the area where Floyd died. Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was arrested and murdered in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Do you think such settlement is adequate to provide justice for the victims, their families and communities affected by the horrific racism? What else should be done more? How can you contribute to bring desired changes?</p>

The experience of a Japanese American whose family has been in the United States for three generations will be drastically different from a Laotian American who has only been in the United States for a few years. This section primarily discusses Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese immigrants and shows the differences between their experiences. The most recent estimate from the U.S. Census Bureau (2019) suggest about 5.9 percent of the population identify themselves as Asian.</p>

            <h4 data-type="title">How and Why They Came</h4>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id3016512">The national and ethnic diversity of Asian American immigration history is reflected in the variety of their experiences in joining U.S. society. Asian immigrants have come to the United States in waves, at different times, and for different reasons.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id3036543">The first Asian immigrants to come to the United States in the mid-nineteenth century were Chinese. These immigrants were primarily men whose intention was to work for several years in order to earn incomes to support their families in China. Their main destination was the American West, where the Gold Rush was drawing people with its lure of abundant money. The construction of the Transcontinental Railroad was underway at this time, and the Central Pacific section hired thousands of migrant Chinese men to complete the laying of rails across the rugged Sierra Nevada mountain range. Chinese men also engaged in other manual labor like mining and agricultural work. The work was grueling and underpaid, but like many immigrants, they persevered.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id1299473">Japanese immigration began in the 1880s, on the heels of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Many Japanese immigrants came to Hawaii to participate in the sugar industry; others came to the mainland, especially to California. Unlike the Chinese, however, the Japanese had a strong government that negotiated with the U.S. government to ensure the well-being of their immigrants. Japanese men were able to bring their wives and families to the United States, and were thus able to produce second- and third-generation Japanese Americans more quickly than their Chinese counterparts.</p>

While Korean immigration has been fairly gradual, Vietnamese immigration occurred primarily post-1975, after the fall of Saigon and the establishment of restrictive communist policies in Vietnam. Whereas many Asian immigrants came to the United States to seek better economic opportunities, Vietnamese immigrants came as political refugees, seeking asylum from harsh conditions in their homeland. The Refugee Act of 1980 helped them to find a place to settle in the United States.</p>

This act was a result of anti-Chinese sentiment burgeoned by a depressed economy and loss of jobs. White workers blamed Chinese migrants for taking jobs, and the passage of the Act meant the number of Chinese workers decreased. Chinese men did not have the funds to return to China or to bring their families to the United States, so they remained physically and culturally segregated in the Chinatowns of large cities. Later legislation, the Immigration Act of 1924, further curtailed Chinese immigration. The Act included the race-based National Origins Act, which was aimed at keeping U.S. ethnic stock as undiluted as possible by reducing &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D; immigrants. It was not until after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 that Chinese immigration again increased, and many Chinese families were reunited.</p>

The California Alien Land Law of 1913 was aimed at them and other Asian immigrants, and it prohibited immigrants from owning land. An even uglier action was the Japanese internment camps of World War II, discussed earlier as an illustration of expulsion.</p>

Stereotyping all Asians as smart and capable can also lead to a lack of much-needed government assistance and to educational and professional discrimination.</p>

Community trackers recorded more than 3,000 anti-Asian attacks nationwide during 2020 in comparison to about 100 such incidents recorded annually in the prior years (Abdollah  2021).

According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2019), 76.3 percent of U.S. adults currently identify themselves as White alone. In this section, we will focus on German, Irish, Italian, and Eastern European immigrants.</p>

They joined a newly minted United States that was primarily made up of White Protestants from England. While most immigrants came searching for a better life, their experiences were not all the same.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id2299533">The first major influx of European immigrants came from Germany and Ireland, starting in the 1820s. Germans came both for economic opportunity and to escape political unrest and military conscription, especially after the Revolutions of 1848. Many German immigrants of this period were political refugees: liberals who wanted to escape from an oppressive government. They were well-off enough to make their way inland, and they formed heavily German enclaves in the Midwest that exist to this day.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id2364793">The Irish immigrants of the same time period were not always as well off financially, especially after the Irish Potato Famine of 1845. Irish immigrants settled mainly in the cities of the East Coast, where they were employed as laborers and where they faced significant discrimination.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id1453302">German and Irish immigration continued into the late 19th century and earlier 20th century, at which point the numbers for Southern and Eastern European immigrants started growing as well. Italians, mainly from the Southern part of the country, began arriving in large numbers in the 1890s. Eastern European immigrants&#x2014;people from Russia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Austria-Hungary&#x2014;started arriving around the same time. Many of these Eastern Europeans were peasants forced into a hardscrabble existence in their native lands; political unrest, land shortages, and crop failures drove them to seek better opportunities in the United States. The Eastern European immigration wave also included Jewish people escaping pogroms (anti-Jewish massacres) of Eastern Europe and the Pale of Settlement in what was then Poland and Russia.</p>

While they may not have been welcomed with open arms, they were able to settle in enclaves and establish roots. A notable exception to this was during the lead up to World War I and through World War II, when anti-German sentiment was virulent.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id1314794">Irish immigrants, many of whom were very poor, were more of an underclass than the Germans. In Ireland, the English had oppressed the Irish for centuries, eradicating their language and culture and discriminating against their religion (Catholicism). Although the Irish had a larger population than the English, they were a subordinate group. This dynamic reached into the New World, where Anglo-Americans saw Irish immigrants as a race apart: dirty, lacking ambition, and suitable for only the most menial jobs. In fact, Irish immigrants were subject to criticism identical to that with which the dominant group characterized African Americans. By necessity, Irish immigrants formed tight communities segregated from their Anglo neighbors.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id1496702">The later wave of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe was also subject to intense discrimination and prejudice. In particular, the dominant group&#x2014;which now included second- and third-generation Germans and Irish&#x2014;saw Italian immigrants as the dregs of Europe and worried about the purity of the American race (Myers 2007). Italian immigrants lived in segregated slums in Northeastern cities, and in some cases were even victims of violence and lynching similar to what African Americans endured. They undertook physical labor at lower pay than other workers, often doing the dangerous work that other laborers were reluctant to take on, such as earth moving and construction.</p>

One of the country&#x2019;s largest cultural groups, Irish Americans have slowly achieved acceptance and assimilation into the dominant group.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id1346319">Myers (2007) states that Italian Americans&#x2019; cultural assimilation is &#x201C;almost complete, but with remnants of ethnicity.&#x201D; The presence of &#x201C;Little Italy&#x201D; neighborhoods&#x2014;originally segregated slums where Italians congregated in the nineteenth century&#x2014;exist today. While tourists flock to the saints&#x2019; festivals in Little Italies, most Italian Americans have moved to the suburbs at the same rate as other White groups. Italian Americans also became more accepted after World War II, partly because of other, newer migrating groups and partly because of their significant contribution to the war effort, which saw over 500,000 Italian Americans join the military and fight against the Axis powers, which included Italy itself.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_fs-idm383813936">As you will see in the Religion chapter, Jewish people were also a core immigrant group to the United States. They often resided in tight-knit neighborhoods in a similar way to Italian people. Jewish identity is interesting and varied, in that many Jewish people consider themselves as members of a collective ethnic group as well as a religion, and many Jewish people feel connected by their ancestry as well as their religion. In fact, much of the data around the number of Jewish Americans is presented with caveats about different definitions and identifications of what it means to be Jewish (Lipka 2013).</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id1101266">As we have seen, there is no minority group that fits easily in a category or that can be described simply. While sociologists believe that individual experiences can often be understood in light of their social characteristics (such as race, class, or gender), we must balance this perspective with awareness that no two individuals&#x2019; experiences are alike. Making generalizations can lead to stereotypes and prejudice. The same is true for White ethnic Americans, who come from diverse backgrounds and have had a great variety of experiences.</p>

They were predominantly Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian Christians, and they came to escape persecution and to make a better life. These early immigrants and their descendants, who were more likely to think of themselves as Syrian or Lebanese than Arab, represent almost half of the Arab American population today (Myers 2007). Restrictive immigration policies from the 1920s until 1965 curtailed immigration, but Arab immigration since 1965 has been steady. Immigrants from this time period have been more likely to be Muslim and more highly educated, escaping political unrest and looking for better opportunities.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_fs-idm400988448">The United States was deeply affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and racial profiling has proceeded against Arab Americans since then. Particularly when engaged in air travel, being young and Arab-looking is enough to warrant a special search or detainment. This Islamophobia (irrational fear of or hatred against Muslims) does not show signs of abating. Arab Americans represent all religious practices, despite the stereotype that all Arabic people practice Islam. Geographically, the Arab region comprises the Middle East and parts of North Africa (MENA). People whose ancestry lies in that area or who speak primarily Arabic may consider themselves Arabs.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_fs-idm375835504">The U.S. Census has struggled with the issue of Arab identity. The 2020 Census, as in previous years, did not offer a (MENA) category under the question of race. The US government rejected a push by Arab American advocates and organizations to add the new category, meaning that people stemming from the Arab region will be counted as "white" (Harb 2018). Do you think an addition of MENA category is appropriate to reduce prejudice and discrimination against Arab Americans? What other categories should be added to promote racial justice in the United States?</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Hispanic Americans</h3>
          <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id2308567">The U.S. Census Bureau uses two ethnicities in collecting and reporting data: &#x201C;Hispanic or Latino&#x201D; and &#x201C;Not Hispanic or Latino." Hispanic or Latino is a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race. Hispanic Americans have a wide range of backgrounds and nationalities.</p>
          <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_fs-idm390299120">The segment of the U.S. population that self-identifies as Hispanic in 2019 was recently estimated at 18.5 percent of the total (U.S. Census Bureau 2019). According to the 2010 U.S. Census, about 75 percent of the respondents who identify as Hispanic report being of Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban origin. Remember that the U.S. Census allows people to report as being more than one ethnicity.</p>
          <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id1178395">Not only are there wide differences among the different origins that make up the Hispanic American population, but there are also different names for the group itself. Hence, there have been some disagreements over whether Hispanic or Latino is the correct term for a group this diverse, and whether it would be better for people to refer to themselves as being of their origin specifically, for example, Mexican American or Dominican American. This section will compare the experiences of Mexican Americans and Cuban Americans.</p>
          <section data-depth="2" id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_fs-id1494103">

Mexican migration to the United States started in the early 1900s in response to the need for inexepensive agricultural labor. Mexican migration was often circular; workers would stay for a few years and then go back to Mexico with more money than they could have made in their country of origin. The length of Mexico&#x2019;s shared border with the United States has made immigration easier than for many other immigrant groups.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id810887">Cuban Americans are the second-largest Hispanic subgroup, and their history is quite different from that of Mexican Americans. The main wave of Cuban immigration to the United States started after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959 and reached its crest with the Mariel boatlift in 1980. Castro&#x2019;s Cuban Revolution ushered in an era of communism that continues to this day. To avoid having their assets seized by the government, many wealthy and educated Cubans migrated north, generally to the Miami area.</p>

Western growers needed a steady supply of labor, and the 1940s and 1950s saw the official federal Bracero Program (<em data-effect="italics">bracero</em> is Spanish for <em data-effect="italics">strong-arm</em>) that offered protection to Mexican guest workers. Interestingly, 1954 also saw the enactment of &#x201C;Operation Wetback,&#x201D; which deported thousands of illegal Mexican workers. From these examples, we can see the U.S. treatment of immigration from Mexico has been ambivalent at best.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id3023914">Sociologist Douglas Massey (2006) suggests that although the average standard of living than in Mexico may be lower in the United States, it is not so low as to make permanent migration the goal of most Mexicans. However, the strengthening of the border that began with 1986&#x2019;s Immigration Reform and Control Act has made one-way migration the rule for most Mexicans. Massey argues that the rise of illegal one-way immigration of Mexicans is a direct outcome of the law that was intended to reduce it.</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id2774549">Cuban Americans, perhaps because of their relative wealth and education level at the time of immigration, have fared better than many immigrants. Further, because they were fleeing a Communist country, they were given refugee status and offered protection and social services. The Cuban Migration Agreement of 1995 has curtailed legal immigration from Cuba, leading many Cubans to try to immigrate illegally by boat. According to a 2009 report from the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. government applies a &#x201C;wet foot/dry foot&#x201D; policy toward Cuban immigrants; Cubans who are intercepted while still at sea will be returned to Cuba, while those who reach the shore will be permitted to stay in the United States.</p>

Myers (2007) observes that no other minority group (except the Chinese) has immigrated to the United States in such an environment of legal dispute. He notes that in some years, three times as many Mexican immigrants may have entered the United States undocumented as those who arrived documented. It should be noted that this is due to enormous disparity of economic opportunity on two sides of an open border, not because of any inherent inclination to break laws. In his report, &#x201C;Measuring Immigrant Assimilation in the United States,&#x201D; Jacob Vigdor (2008) states that Mexican immigrants experience relatively low rates of economic and civic assimilation. He further suggests that &#x201C;the slow rates of economic and civic assimilation set Mexicans apart from other immigrants, and may reflect the fact that the large numbers of Mexican immigrants residing in the United States undocumented have few opportunities to advance themselves along these dimensions.&#x201D;</p>
            <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id1221790">By contrast, Cuban Americans are often seen as a model minority group within the larger Hispanic group. Many Cubans had higher socioeconomic status when they arrived in this country, and their anti-Communist agenda has made them welcome refugees to this country. In south Florida, especially, Cuban Americans are active in local politics and professional life. As with Asian Americans, however, being a model minority can mask the issue of powerlessness that these minority groups face in U.S. society.</p>

A harsh example of this is in Arizona, where a stringent immigration law&#x2014;known as SB 1070 (for Senate Bill 1070)&#x2014;caused a nationwide controversy. Formally titled "Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, the law requires that during a lawful stop, detention, or arrest, Arizona police officers must establish the immigration status of anyone they suspect may be here illegally. The law makes it a crime for individuals to fail to have documents confirming their legal status, and it gives police officers the right to detain people they suspect may be in the country illegally.</p>
                <p id="auto_6ae57670-6018-4994-a651-9a7755739413_import-auto-id1196015">To many, the most troublesome aspect of this law is the latitude it affords police officers in terms of whose citizenship they may question. Having &#x201C;reasonable suspicion that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States&#x201D; is reason enough to demand immigration papers (Senate Bill 1070 2010). Critics say this law will encourage racial profiling (the illegal practice of law enforcement using race as a basis for suspecting someone of a crime), making it hazardous to be caught &#x201C;Driving While Brown,&#x201D; a takeoff on the legal term Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) or the slang reference of &#x201C;Driving While Black.&#x201D; Driving While Brown refers to the likelihood of getting pulled over just for being nonWhite.</p>

The future of SB 1070 is uncertain, but many other states have tried or are trying to pass similar measures. Do you think such measures are appropriate?</p>
