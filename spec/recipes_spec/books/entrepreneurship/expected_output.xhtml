Libin&#x2019;s focus was on improving quality of life by allowing users to track and organize information in their business and personal lives, whereas Huang focused on a global environmental issue to sustainably improve water quality. Each idea solves a problem that many people might not even have noticed. Becoming aware of problems that need to be solved, then solving the problem to make our lives easier or better, is part of the entrepreneurial perspective.</p>

This new creation can be a new process or product, a business that identifies a new or unique target market, or a combination of ideas that creates a new approach or method, for example.</p>

And, no, the McDonald&#x2019;s franchisee didn&#x2019;t create McDonald&#x2019;s. But he certainly created a McDonald&#x2019;s where there never was one before.

Research at the neighborhood level found that in New York City, the richer third of neighborhoods had more than twice the rate of self-employment than the poorest third.

          <p id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm350375984">People often have thought of entrepreneurs as corporate rebels, nonconformists, or activists. Being an entrepreneur has become synonymous with being an innovator, a change agent, or a risk taker. Regardless of job titles or descriptive characteristics, entrepreneurship has a universal appeal for how people think and engage with the world.</p>
          <p id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm342188512">Choosing the path of entrepreneurship requires a willingness to take on calculated risks. The difference between risk and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_term11" group-by="c"><em data-effect="italics">calculated</em> risk</span> is <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_term12" group-by="d">due diligence</span>, or conducting the necessary research and investigation to make informed decisions that minimize risk. Not everyone is comfortable letting go of a steady paycheck, especially when we know that there is no long-term guarantee that the paycheck will continue into the future. In one approach to minimizing personal financial risk, some startup entrepreneurs continue with their current employment while working on the side to develop their idea into a venture that eventually will generate an income. Until the venture requires near full-time work and generates income, maintaining an outside income works well for many entrepreneurial teams.</p>

The angel investor asked a few questions and wasn&#x2019;t impressed. This investor believed that Gilboa and Blumenthal should demonstrate their solid commitment to the venture by quitting their day jobs to dedicate more time and energy to Warby Parker. Instead of following that advice, Gilboa and Blumenthal kept their day jobs while they continued to work toward building their venture, and Warby Parker eventually became highly successful. There are many paths to becoming an entrepreneur, and many paths to creating a successful venture (see <a href="#page_23e1b5ec-9da3-4e16-ad15-5720248e0363">Entrepreneurial Journey and Pathways</a>). It is important to identify the path that works best in your life&#x2014;and for the venture&#x2014;and that supports your goals and your unique situation and visions.</p>

A lifestyle venture is also more likely to be funded through family and friends, and more traditional methods such as a bank loan or a small business loan. This lifestyle includes greater freedom to decide areas of responsibilities, hours of contribution to the venture, and other decisions that support the desired lifestyle.

Identifying the problem&#x2014;and testing the potential, novelty, and feasibility of your solution&#x2014;is an important part of resolving the problem. Often, when we start to explore the problem, we find that it has multiple causes. Among them are:</p>
          <ul id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm355491984">
            <li>The need for something to be better, faster, or easier</li>
            <li>The effects of changes in world on your industry, product, or service</li>
            <li>Market trends based on geography, demographics, or the psychology of the customers</li>
          </ul>

          <p id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm361897456">One characteristic of a savvy entrepreneur is recognizing the ability to identify a problem from an opportunity-identification perspective. We might identify feeling hungry as a problem, but an entrepreneur would identify the problem using an <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_term23" group-by="o">opportunity-identifying perspective</span> by determining how the problem could be translated into an opportunity to create a new venture&#x2014;perhaps combining the problem of feeling hungry between meals into a street kiosk or a vending machine with food choices or creating a new snack that is nutritious, satisfying, and portable. People need to eat, and they get hungry, but during a busy day with no open time or convenient food, people end up hungry. Rephrasing the problem, or need, from an opportunity viewpoint opens the search for a sustainable solution beyond the simple awareness of feeling hungry. We might solve this problem by opening a snack bar with offerings that contain essential vitamins and proteins, and is easy to transport with a long shelf life. Understanding the problem from the perspective of how to solve it for one person into how to solve it for multiple people rephrases the problem into an opportunity-identification perspective.</p>

People trapped in a war-torn region may not be able to leave the safety of their shelters to find food, grow food, or barter for food, or they may not have the money to buy food. How could you reach your target market within a war-torn area? Red Cross emergency response vehicles traveled 2.5 million miles to deliver food, relief supplies, and support to communities affected by disasters during 2017.<a href="#auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm342977328" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">9</a> That&#x2019;s the equivalent of driving around the globe 103 times.

Every day, people become entrepreneurs as they identify and solve problems, or face new challenges or frustrations, and resolve them in creating products or services to address these issues.</p>

Or had their income reduced, or benefits removed? Research shows that 47 percent of all US employment is at risk through artificial intelligence and other technologies, although there will also be new opportunities for jobs that currently don&#x2019;t exist.<a href="#auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm352924592" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">10</a> These types of experiences and outlooks have provided the impetus for many people to start their own businesses. When we work for someone else, we are at the mercy of their decisions and actions, but we get paid and don&#x2019;t carry the full risk of their decisions. When we work for ourselves, we get to make the decisions (not that making decisions is easy). But when we have our own business, we have greater control&#x2014;in exchange, we also carry the risk for all decisions we make. This control over decision-making is one reason that some people find the world of entrepreneurship attractive.</p>

          <p id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm364414768">Another contributing factor to the desire to become an entrepreneur is the excitement and fun of creating something new. Many entrepreneurs are excited at the idea of moving the concept through to the materialization of the idea.</p>
          <p id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm356761424">A third factor that supports the growth in entrepreneurship is the combination of retirement and longer life expectancies. Many people enjoy working. For them, retirement consists of too much open time and not enough activities or the type of engagement with the outside world that fulfilled their needs during their working lives. Retirement also presents unique financial considerations, depending on an individual&#x2019;s lifetime savings and planning. The combination of having available time and a desire for continued earnings encourages some older adults to explore their own entrepreneurial opportunities.</p>
          <p id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm328318080" class="has-noteref">A fourth factor driving the growth of entrepreneurship is the expanding awareness and support of entrepreneurship as a viable career choice. In much of the twentieth century, families encouraged their children to find a stable career with a large corporation. During this era, there was a certain expectation of reciprocal loyalty between the employer and the employee based on some traditional employee-employer roles in that century. The general, informal agreement was that if employees came to work every day and fulfilled their responsibilities, they would have long-term employment with that corporation. But as competition increased and new business practices evolved, this unspoken guarantee no longer held true. The model of certainty of employment gradually disappeared. As people acquired a new perspective on their careers and income, they increasingly realized that we are all responsible for our own paths. Most studies suggest that people change their careers between three and seven times.<a href="#auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm339865904" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">11</a> Note that this is not how often people change jobs, but how often they change their careers, moving from one industry to another, or moving from one type of work to a different type of work. The older model of stability through working hard for someone else has vanished. This awareness and acceptance have encouraged recent generations to consider creating their own futures through entrepreneurial ventures.</p>

What does it take to become an entrepreneur? In addition to having an entrepreneurial mindset (see <a href="#page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d">The Entrepreneurial Mindset</a>), entrepreneurs also need education and funding to support their new ventures.</p>

They are often entrepreneurs who have successfully launched and harvested their own ventures, and who have an interest in helping other entrepreneurs in their startups, staying active in the entrepreneurial world, and a desire to receive a return on their investment in the venture. Angel investors often provide funding early in the life of a venture. As the venture grows, it typically requires more funding, at which time venture capitalists may invest in the venture. A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_term28" group-by="v">venture capitalist</span> (VC) is a group of people (or organizations) who pool resources to invest in entrepreneurial ventures, contributing larger sums of funds than are available through angel investors. In each funding round, investors receive an equity stake in the venture with expectations that at some point in the future, the venture will be sold, or harvested, at which time the investors will receive a return on their investment. Because they tend to be in larger groups, VCs typically have access to larger amounts of money and resources than individual angel investors.

For example, in the Middle Eastern kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a newer driver of entrepreneurship includes a high unemployment rate with a large percentage of the population in its prime earning years. In the past, employment was less of a concern because of dependency on state support from oil revenue. The population received monthly allotments to cover expenses from state-owned oil production. More recently, the population has become restless, with a desire to become productive and have greater control over their own resources. And the rulers recognize that oil production income is volatile and unsustainable. Today, with more future-oriented leaders, countries in the Middle East desire to encourage their citizens to consider starting their own businesses.<a href="#auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm358751904" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">14</a> The example of entrepreneurship in the United States has spread around the globe, with other countries taking an interest in developing support systems to encourage their populations to become entrepreneurs.</p>

          <p id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm361672064">As noted, the United States is a world leader in entrepreneurial innovation. Perhaps because the United States is, in large part, a nation of immigrants, with people arriving from all over the world, Americans have few prescribed traditions that encourage conformity. America&#x2019;s longstanding traditions and reputation for individualism, ingenuity, and self-reliance have reinforced this mindset. However, the governments of other nations have discouraged their citizens from independent or innovative thinking. Some cultures emphasize political, cultural, and economic unity, and place a strong value on not being noticed, blending in, and following prescribed habits and traditions. Countries like Japan, France, Russia, China, and others continue to reflect these norms. Other countries have complex bureaucracies that prevent quick responses and place barriers to entrepreneurial activities. Parts of worldwide economic structures (banking, investments, and technology) are not accessible or even explicitly exclude some nations and the poor. Systems like this discourage people from coming forward with entrepreneurial ideas because the culture and bureaucracy prevent people from finding access to information necessary for the successful advancement of an idea. In contrast, other countries are noticing the benefits of encouraging their populations to become more open-minded and creative through new ventures.</p>

What conditions encourage creativity and innovation? Acceptance of failure is a key characteristic for success as an entrepreneur. Many of the great inventions in the United States resulted after dozens of failures, as when Thomas <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_term30" group-by="E">Edison</span> eventually developed a working light bulb. Edison identified a problem: Once the sun set, working hours were restricted, as were daily activities such as reading a book or washing dishes. Edison, along with many other inventors, recognized the need for an artificial light source. Consider how complex this idea was and how many failures must have occurred before creating a product that emitted light.</p>
          <p id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm342968528">Another condition that encourages entrepreneurial behavior is the ability and opportunity to connect with other people to discuss ideas, problems, challenges, and solutions. This connection with other people, in an open environment that supports the exchange of ideas, is essential for encouraging creativity and innovation.</p>
          <p id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm351341584">With the advent of the Internet, people around the planet are becoming increasingly aware of geopolitical and environmental situations across the globe. As more people observe these changes and situations, more people exchange ideas. These discussions can generate new opportunities for people to discover methods for solving problems. Any one of us could be living in one country but identifying a problem in another country. Given our interests and backgrounds, we could actively choose to develop a solution for that problem. What we need, as a general approach, is an efficient and transparent way to form companies and enable constructive competition, along with continued free and fair trade.</p>
          <p id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm353533792">These are just some of the areas that many nations and organizations consider as they seek to encourage a transition away from group-prescribed thinking toward uniquely individual entrepreneurial ideas. Each of us encounters life from a different perspective. Although we all might recognize the restrictions presented by the sun setting every night, only a few people might question why we couldn&#x2019;t change that situation by creating our own light. Similarly, someone in another country may observe our country (or vice versa) and ask why that country has a particular problem. Meanwhile, people living with that problem may have become so accustomed to it that they might not recognize the opportunity to seek solutions.</p>
          <p id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm329729360" class="has-noteref">Increasing opportunities in entrepreneurial education are also driving growth. More colleges and universities are teaching entrepreneurial studies and opening entrepreneurial centers that encourage students from every discipline to become entrepreneurs.<a href="#auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm228384608" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">16</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm268131328" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">17</a> As the employment and entrepreneurial landscape continue to evolve, some institutions have started offering courses to prepare students for work in the gig economy.<a href="#auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm274368640" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">18</a> In fact, some of the best new entrepreneurial ideas come from groups of students in different majors who collaborate to create new, innovative business ideas that meet specific needs and challenges in today&#x2019;s world. In some cases, students from different universities around the globe are connecting to come up with business ideas to solve global problems, such as the lack of clean drinking water and the need for medical vaccination programs. Technology and global travel have made such partnerships more common and very productive.</p>

Awareness of an idea that is commonplace in one country, but new to a different country, presents the possibility of introducing that idea to another nation. In the Starbucks example, was there a problem that needed to be solved? Not necessarily, but the founder, Howard <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_term32" group-by="S">Schultz</span>, had a desire to bring a specific quality-of-life element from one country to another, a business idea with an entrepreneurial aspect. One of the entrepreneurial aspects of creating Starbucks was the idea of mass expansion of coffee shops. Prior to Starbucks, the idea of creating a high-quality coffee drink hadn&#x2019;t been developed. Even more significant was the idea of expanding the business across the United States and then around the world.</p>

With Starbucks, people changed their ideas about coffee and their coffee-drinking habits. Although businesses like <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_term33" group-by="D">Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts</span> served coffee, their focus was on selling donuts, not coffee.

Do you find yourself daydreaming about creating the next great solution to society&#x2019;s problems, or do you see yourself providing a solution for the next health or environmental crisis? Maybe you can imagine yourself creating something that equally balances art, function, and ingenuity.</p>
        <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm362784528">This section is designed to help you develop your entrepreneurial vision. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term42" group-by="V">Vision</span> is an important part of everyone&#x2019;s future, and this is especially true for entrepreneurs. Establishing your vision is the first of several steps toward making your venture a reality.</p>
        <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm345787328">Many would-be entrepreneurs aspire to launch the next great business or organization that will change the world. Some know exactly what they want to create, whereas others figure it out as they go along. Although there is no secret to success, you do need to have some idea about what you envision for your entrepreneurial future. What do you see in your future? How do you want to contribute to the world?</p>
        <section data-depth="1" id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm362639936">
          <h3 data-type="title">Entrepreneurial Vision</h3>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm338976448">Every successful entrepreneur that you encounter or read about likely started with an image or idea related to something he or she felt passionate about creating. This occurs even when the person has no idea how (or if) what they desire to accomplish or create will become a reality. An entrepreneur&#x2019;s vision is the start of a roadmap that will determine where he or she wants to go with their entrepreneurial efforts. Vision speaks to what the entrepreneur wants the business to look like in the future&#x2014;perhaps five or ten years out. Unfortunately, many potential entrepreneurs have dreams and ideas but never develop a concrete vision. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term43" group-by="v">vision statement</span> is the picture you have for what the venture will become in the future: what it will grow into. Be aware, though, that oftentimes, the identified vision at the start of the venture changes into something different. In later chapters, we discuss how this change requires open-mindedness and a willingness to adapt. The <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term44" group-by="m">mission statement</span> is a formal declaration about what the venture will do, what value it will provide to the end customer, and how it will accomplish this action. In describing your mission, carefully think about the value proposition that you provide. The <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term45" group-by="v">value proposition</span> is a summary statement that conveys the benefits your product, service, or unique business process/model provides to customers. This relates back to the perspective of problem solving. Not only do you need to solve the problem, but you also must provide value. We might solve a problem, but if the value proposition isn&#x2019;t relevant or seen as &#x201C;real&#x201D; by the customer, the venture will probably not be successful. Both concepts of a future vision and the mission of the venture should be formalized into statements.</p>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm306583920">In spite of your best efforts, you may have trouble putting your entrepreneurial vision on paper. This is normal, especially in the early stages of the process. You may want to start with an outline and fill in the details later. Or set aside a short time each day that you can spend on this task so you train your mind to think about the vision you are setting for yourself. If you experience a mental block, try changing your environment&#x2014;go outside, try a different time of day, or go to a setting that has similarities to the business you are interested in creating. You might also consider talking with someone who has experience in the industry to give you suggestions. Or better yet, find a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term46" group-by="m">mentor</span> in your chosen area of interest and keep this person apprised of your progress. Having someone to bounce ideas off is a great asset to have when imagining the possibilities of the future.</p>

The vision for this organization includes building a vast network of volunteers and partnerships to stop homelessness and bring people together. This vision is about creating community, helping each other, and strengthening communities. The business model encourages homeless people to create short Miracle Messages through video, audio, or text, with messages then uploaded to social media and other methods to find that person&#x2019;s loved one.</p>

Their slogan, &#x201C;Everyone is someone&#x2019;s somebody,&#x201D; conveys their culture of care and concern for all human life. As you read about this organization, consider what this organization could become in the future, with an extensive network that supports connecting volunteers to homeless people, then to loved ones, and to other organizations that support the physical relocations and resources to address the original reasons why the person became homeless. How can this organization become a global business? Consider families dislocated through wars, famine, and other disasters who want to find their loved ones. The infrastructure developed with Miracle Messages could be replicated for other populations besides homeless people in the United States. Depending on the founder&#x2019;s vision, Miracle Messages could continue to focus on homelessness in the United States, or the vision could expand into other geographic areas and needs.</p>

          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm365957568">In an entrepreneurial venture, when the vision has a shorter timeline, such as five years, it could focus on a local problem or situation, and over time evolve into a vision that is broader and includes more diverse markets or populations. Your vision should inspire the people involved in your startup to support your venture. Use your imagination to create this picture of your venture with a focus on the future of the venture. Even though entrepreneurs use their imaginations and creativity in developing this picture, they also need to understand the venture&#x2019;s industry, the competition, and trends that are evolving or might evolve in the future. This information helps guide the vision for the venture and define how it is uniquely different from any other business. Ideally, the vision should be insightful, bold, inspirational, and believable, and it should be developed into a formal vision statement.</p>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm366410752">The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term50" group-by="v">vision statement</span> should also be clearly stated and discussed with the startup team. Although you might not have a startup team, a mentor, or a support group developed yet, to create an entrepreneurial venture, you will need support. Your <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term51" group-by="s">support network</span> understands that working without pay is often the normal situation at the beginning, with the potential for financial rewards coming when the venture is harvested or sold. For some entrepreneurs, knowing the vision includes the sale of the venture to another group or corporation is difficult to accept. However, that is the point at which the venture can grow to become ever more viable. Alternatively, if your vision is to be a small business owner, such as owning a franchise, then you are buying into a business plan package that has already fine-tuned the processes and decisions to support your success as the owner/manager of that business. A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term52" group-by="s">small business owner</span> starts or buys into a business idea that already exists, whereas an <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term53" group-by="e">entrepreneur</span> is someone who seeks to create something new through either new products, services, methodologies, or combinations of ideas that create a new venture or organization.</p>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm348939792">The lead entrepreneur should share the vision statement with employees and investors, as these groups are formalized, communicating what this vision means personally and to the success of the venture. You might also need to revisit this vision as your venture grows, making changes based on your decisions and knowledge about your industry, products, and customers&#x2019; needs. Even if your vision statement changes based on new information and decisions, creating an initial vision statement is a valuable step and will help guide your decisions.</p>

Artists typically show their creative side in their art, musicians show their creativity through music, and writers express their creativity in writing.

What picture of your desired future do you have in mind? How could this vision fit with the ideas you have of creating a successful venture? Notice that these questions are about both your personal future and the vision for your venture&#x2019;s future. These two pictures should coexist. The vision for your personal future should allow for the necessary resources to support the venture&#x2019;s future, just as the venture&#x2019;s future will provide for your personal future. We will discuss work-life balance later in the chapter to help you identify what creates success as you describe your vision.</p>

This type of thinking allows people to come up with ideas that they might not have had without adopting a creative mindset. The creative thinking process (covered in more depth in <a href="#page_0fa00121-60d7-4c46-801e-20768f41c25c">Creativity, Innovation, and Invention</a>) has four steps: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification (<a href="#auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_OSX_Eship_01_02_creative" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.8</a>).</p>

As part of the process of tapping into creative ideas, you can apply <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term55" group-by="d">divergent thinking</span> by generating as many ideas as possible, even when those ideas do not seem logical. Create a list of conflicting ideas, or ideas that are diverse and disparate. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term56" group-by="P"><em data-effect="italics">Preparation</em></span> is the first step of the creative thinking process. The next action is to walk away from thinking about the activity: <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term57" group-by="i"><em data-effect="italics">incubation</em></span>. We are programming our minds to realize that the work done in preparation is an important topic for consideration. When we walk away from consciously thinking about the activity or problem, we allow our unconscious minds to continue to think about the activity, even though our conscious minds are busy doing other things. This incubation period is essential for advancing creativity. In the incubation stage, you might go for a walk, take a nap, or just continue with your daily activities. At some point, you may have a sudden inspiration or <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term58" group-by="i"><em data-effect="italics">illumination</em></span>&#x2014;an <em data-effect="italics">aha!</em> moment&#x2014;that clearly addresses the activity or problem you want to solve. In this step, the answer often pops into our conscious minds, and we recognize how to proceed. The last step is <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term59" group-by="v"><em data-effect="italics">verification</em></span>, crafting our vision statement or message, or responding to the exercise in creative thinking. You can apply this creative thinking process to many different business situations. Once we further develop and crystallize our ideas (the Business Model Canvas discussed in <a href="#page_ae0c954d-5964-416b-a13f-3c1039594844">Launch for Growth to Success</a> is a good tool for this activity), we provide an opening for a creative and viable solution as we continue to think about the issue.</p>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm324729040">Design thinking, brainstorming, and mind mapping are tools that you will learn about later in the course. Although these tools may be familiar, there are specific methodologies that can optimize their success in entrepreneurial situations. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_term60" group-by="B">Brainstorming</span> requires that participants generate ideas around the desired topic without judgment. You can do this alone or with others, but including other people provides a greater variety of ideas, as one person&#x2019;s ideas might trigger another idea from someone else. Be sure to write down your thoughts so that you can return to them later. Brainstorming is different from divergent thinking, which does not require ideas to be associated with the identified topic. For example, in brainstorming on the topic of helping the homeless population, we might come up with ideas such as finding community food and housing, or providing free medical care. Using divergent thinking, we would arrive at more diverse ideas, such as filming homeless people then uploading the videos to a social media website to connect family members with the homeless person. These tools could incorporate divergent thinking in the idea-generation step, but typically, unless people are taught how to use divergent thinking, the ideas generated are more structured and constrained, and more logical. As much as we want to encourage divergent ideas, we also want to discourage any judgment around our ideas. Once we start judging our ideas, we restrict our creativity and end up with less than ideal solutions. Approach this process with some playfulness and relaxation.</p>

Here, you create an illustration on paper or a chalk board. Write down the words that come to mind then link those words together with lines in a diagram that shows how each word relates to the others. The idea is that one word can lead to another. You can discover associations that might not have been evident before you created the mind map.</p>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm362179600">You can conduct research on entrepreneurial ideas by creating surveys and asking people questions about their experiences related to your idea. For example, let&#x2019;s say you are considering creating a new non-messy health food that can be eaten while commuting to work. You could ask people about their experiences eating while commuting to work or ask questions about nutritional concerns or diets. Or you could find secondary data on when people eat, eating while commuting, popular diets, or other related topics. Or you could find case studies that focus on a few in-depth similar areas of interest or perform your own case studies by selecting a few peers to track their eating habits. Or you could create a prototype of your product and ask people to tell you about their experience using your product. You will learn more about research strategies in <a href="#page_6fbace89-c6c1-4615-aa52-9b1978ca88b8">Identifying Entrepreneurial Opportunity</a>, <a href="#page_d4133b4e-5333-4dde-a75b-e0dd74b3a49e">Problem Solving and Need Recognition Techniques</a>, and <a href="#page_5373120f-f7d8-478d-937f-c8fd8c65b1f3">Entrepreneurial Marketing and Sales</a>.</p>

          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm351386688">Entrepreneurship comes with many challenges because the entrepreneur must wear many hats. This is especially true if the entrepreneur is the only employee in the business. But regardless of the business model, all entrepreneurs must be able to achieve balance in their lives between their dedication to growing their entrepreneurial venture and their personal life. Developing a vision that includes different areas of your professional and personal life can help make this type of balance achievable.</p>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm350558688">How do you define balance in your life? What areas do you consider when you think about a balanced life? Having enough money to support your lifestyle might be one goal. Other areas might include physical activities or hobbies, social interactions and entertainment, satisfaction with how you earn money, your family and personal relationships, and other interests and values. Some entrepreneurs start lifestyle ventures to achieve this balance. But how do we achieve balance when our goal is to be a career entrepreneur?</p>

Even though Roxanne wanted to provide employment opportunities to people in northern Maine, she knew that her business needed the right infrastructure for success, and that infrastructure wasn&#x2019;t available in Maine. If you choose to become a career entrepreneur, your focus may be primarily on advancing your entrepreneurial idea into a successful venture, like Roxanne did with Burt&#x2019;s Bees; this can come at the expense of personal life goals.</p>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm352602400">Many career entrepreneurs need support from family and friends who accept that the lead entrepreneur&#x2019;s attention and energy are required for the success of the venture, and many lifestyle entrepreneurs will find challenges in meeting the needs of the venture while maintaining work-life balance. Discussions with family, close connections, and the entrepreneurial team should occur in the early idea-formulation stage to gauge the support of the people whose interests might be compromised by the entrepreneur&#x2019;s dedication to advancing the venture.</p>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm328670304">Clearly defining your idea of success for your life, and for your venture, is an important step in achieving balance. What are your priorities? What can you do to balance the success of your new venture, the success of your own life, and the success of your family? Considering that balancing all the roles that we have in life is a frustration point for many people, can you find an opportunity to create an entrepreneurial venture?</p>

          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm341901600">As you explore what success means for your venture and how your definition aligns with balance between your personal life and dedication to your venture, you should consider some of the unique challenges entrepreneurs can face. For example, there might be a learning curve in unfamiliar areas of business, such as accounting or finance. Or you might face a dilemma about whether to expand a product line, or whether or where to open a new location. Entrepreneurs often mention the physical requirements of starting up a business. Physical demands can include the sheer stamina needed to clean a new space, move in, and set up shop. Depending on your business, you also might need to adjust to being on call twenty-four/seven. Here again, developing a vision of where you want to be in the future can help you plan for the challenges you will face in the early stages of your business.</p>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm329974080">Entrepreneurship can be especially draining if you are not prepared for the tasks at hand&#x2014;as can be the case with any professional or personal role. Therefore, self-care and emotional awareness can play a key role in maintaining your emotional health as an entrepreneur. Taking time for yourself is very important. This could involve creating a time management calendar. Tracking how you spend your time can keep you on schedule with tasks and prevent you from expending too much on any one area of the business or your personal life in detriment to the other. Taking time away from the business is emotionally healthy and can provide important perspective that can help you make better decisions. &#x201C;Leaving work at the office&#x201D; is a successful strategy that many business people use to separate their personal and professional lives. If this is not possible&#x2014;for example, if you work from home&#x2014;setting aside family or personal time can allow for work-life balance.</p>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm342009840">Having trusted advisors and mentors for your business and personal life can also promote emotional health. When you face a decision or challenge that you have difficulty with, it is important to have someone to talk to who knows you and knows your situation. Some entrepreneurs may find themselves in their first experience of leading others, with total responsibility for the outcomes as owner of the business. Every business person should have a personal leadership improvement plan. This plan can take the form of academic classes or professional coaching, but sometimes, it will be a personal commitment to improvement. You should identify your preferred leadership styles, as well as leadership strengths and weaknesses. It might be useful to look back on your own work experiences to identify which leadership traits you admired and which ones you didn&#x2019;t. As with any other business skill set, you can learn and improve these strengths in yourself. You also can hire people with complementary skills to handle the areas that you feel unsure about.</p>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm362493408">Being aware of your own strengths and weaknesses, as well as of your preferences and dislikes, will help you achieve and maintain balance in your life. Having counselors, mentors, advisors, checklists, and timelines can keep you on track and prevent any one area of your business or personal life from taking over or being neglected.</p>

You would include financial goals tracked either monthly or yearly to save a set amount of money based on your projection of how much money it will take to own these two vacation homes. You would also set goals about finding the right locations. This process is also necessary to support the success of your business venture. Setting goals is a powerful approach that leads us to the future we want for our lives.</p>

          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm338118432">Here is a fictional example of an entrepreneur&#x2019;s goals, which we can test against the SMART criteria to see if they are feasible. Soraya runs a small tutoring business in Dallas, Texas. Her target market is high school students. Soraya is currently the only employee in her sole proprietorship, but she hopes to hire more employees soon. She is excited about her business, and so far, she has done well in the four years that she has been operating it. On the advice of a friend in business school, Soraya has defined three business goals for the next year. They are:</p>
          <ol id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm357116128" type="1">
            <li>Increase sales by 50 percent.</li>
            <li>Open a new location.</li>
            <li>Hire two employees.</li>
          </ol>
          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm360039968">In reviewing these goals using the SMART criteria, it is evident that goals one and three are <em data-effect="italics">specific</em> because they are quantitative, but goal two is not. All three goals can be <em data-effect="italics">measured</em>. With Soraya as the only employee, it is unlikely that she can achieve goals one and two, but goal three is <em data-effect="italics">achievable</em>. And hiring more staff would increase the likelihood of achieving additional goals. All three goals are <em data-effect="italics">relevant</em> to growing the business. And each goal could use more detail in terms of being <em data-effect="italics">timely</em>. That is, in order to increase sales by 50 percent in the upcoming year, Soraya should have additional monthly or quarterly sales goals to meet her annual goal. Likewise, the opening of a new location requires more time-bound details, such as leasing or purchasing the location, and determining the business model for this location. Finally, hiring additional employees should have a time component as well, such as a timeline for recruiting, interviewing, selection, hiring, and training. Therefore, Soraya&#x2019;s goals are appropriate for her small tutoring business, but they need refining so that they meet the SMART criteria. Soraya is more likely to achieve SMART goals, and they are more likely to lead to desired business outcomes.</p>

        <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm350041216">Entrepreneurship takes many forms (see <a href="#auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm348281808" class="autogenerated-content">Table 1.1</a>), but entrepreneurs share a major trait in common: An <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_term71" group-by="e">entrepreneur</span> is someone who identifies an opportunity and chooses to act on that opportunity. Most business ventures are innovative variations of an existing idea that has spread across communities, regions, and countries, such as starting a restaurant or opening a retail store. These business ventures are, in some ways, a lower-risk approach but nonetheless are entrepreneurial in some way. For example, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_term72" group-by="W">Warby Parker</span>, a profitable startup founded by four graduate students at Wharton, disrupted a major incumbent (<span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_term73" group-by="L">Luxottica</span>) by providing a more convenient (online initially), affordable, and stylish product line for a large segment of consumers. In this sense, their innovation is about creating something new, unique, or different from the mainstream. Yet they attracted an existing, and in some ways mature, sector of an established industry. In a different way, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_term74" group-by="M">McDonalds</span>, which is 90 percent owned by franchisees, introduced an &#x201C;all day breakfast&#x201D; menu in 2017 that was hugely successful; it also targeted a larger segment (in part younger consumers) and brought back consumers who had chosen other options. In summary, many entrepreneurs start a new venture by solving a problem that is significant, offering some value that other people would appreciate if the product or service were available to them. Other entrepreneurs, in contrast, start a venture by offering a &#x201C;better mousetrap&#x201D; in terms of a product, service, or both. In any case, it is vital that the entrepreneur understand the market and target segment well, articulate a key unmet need (&#x201C;pain point&#x201D;), and develop and deliver a solution that is both viable and feasible. In that aspect, many entrepreneurs mitigate risks before they launch the venture.</p>
        <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm391877456" class="has-noteref">Being aware of your surroundings and the encounters in your life can reveal multiple opportunities for entrepreneurship. In our daily lives, we constantly find areas where improvements could be made.

        <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm366217712">These ideas resulted from having an <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_term76" group-by="e">entrepreneurial mindset</span>, an awareness and focus on identifying an opportunity through solving a problem, and a willingness to move forward to advance that idea. The entrepreneurial mindset is the lens through which the entrepreneur views the world, where everything is considered in light of the entrepreneurial business. The business is always a consideration when the entrepreneur makes a decision. In most cases, the action that the entrepreneur takes is for the benefit of the business, but sometimes, it helps the entrepreneur get ready to adopt the appropriate mindset. The mindset becomes a way of life for the entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs often are predisposed to action to achieve their goals and objectives. They are forward thinking, always planning ahead, and they are engaged in &#x201C;what if&#x201D; analyses. They frequently ask themselves, &#x201C;What if we did this?&#x201D; &#x201C;What if a competitor did that?&#x201D;&#x2014;and consider what the business implications would be.</p>
        <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm370930656">Most people follow habits and traditions without being aware of their surroundings or noticing the opportunities to become entrepreneurs. Because anyone can change their perspective from following established patterns to noticing the opportunities around them, anyone can become an entrepreneur. There is no restriction on age, gender, race, country of origin, or personal income. To become an entrepreneur, you need to recognize that an opportunity exists and be willing to act on it. Note, however, that the execution of the entrepreneurial mindset varies in different parts of the world. For example, in many Asian cultures, group decision-making is more common and valued as a character trait. In these regions, an entrepreneur would likely ask the advice of family members or other business associates before taking action. In contrast, individualism is highly valued in the United States and so many US entrepreneurs will decide to implement a plan for the business without consulting others.</p>

          <h3 data-type="title">Entrepreneurial Spirit and Passion</h3>
          <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm409742656">An <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_term77" group-by="e">entrepreneurial spirit</span> allows entrepreneurs to carry a manner of thinking with them each day that allows them to overcome obstacles and to meet challenges with a can-do attitude. What does it mean to have an entrepreneurial spirit? For the purposes of this discussion, it could mean being passionate, purposeful, positive, bold, curious, or persistent.</p>
          <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm410061776">The founders of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_term78" group-by="A">Airbnb</span> have a passion for supporting individual rights to rent out unused space. Why should the established model of hotels prevail? Why shouldn&#x2019;t an individual homeowner have the freedom to rent out unused space and leverage that space into an income? Airbnb has succeeded in creating more flexible and affordable options in the space of the rapidly growing "sharing" economy. At the same time, some states and municipalities have raised issues about the regulations monitoring ventures like this. While entrepreneurial spirit is partly about fighting for individual rights and freedoms, there should be a balance between economic freedom and consumer protection. The entrepreneurial spirit involves a passion for presenting an idea that is worthwhile and valuable, and a willingness to think beyond established patterns and processes, while still keeping in mind local laws and regulations, in the quest to change those established patterns, or at least to offer alternatives to those established patterns.</p>
          <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm372698288">Passion is a critical component of the entrepreneurial process. Without it, an entrepreneur can lose the drive to run the business. Passion can keep an entrepreneur going when the outside world sends negative messages or less-than-positive feedback. For example, if you are truly passionate about starting an animal shelter because of your love of animals, you will find a way to make it happen. Your internal drive to help animals in need will spur you on to do whatever it takes to make the shelter become a reality. The same is true of other types of startups and owners with similar passions. However, passion needs to be informed by the entrepreneur&#x2019;s vision and mission&#x2014;passion of the sake of passion is not enough. A clear <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_term79" group-by="m">mission statement</span>&#x2014;which details why the business exists and the entrepreneur&#x2019;s objectives for achieving that mission&#x2014;will guide an entrepreneur&#x2019;s passion and keep the business on track. Passion, vision, and mission can reinforce each other and keep the entrepreneur on the right track with next steps for the business.</p>
          <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm399815264">Some ideas might seem small or insignificant, but in the field of entrepreneurship, it&#x2019;s important to recognize that for every new startup, someone else may recognize a spin-off idea that expands upon the original idea. The opportunities for identifying new possibilities are endless. Review your work in creating spinoff ideas for Angad Darvani&#x2019;s projects, or Kevin F. Adler&#x2019;s Miracle Messages venture. Or consider possible spin-off ideas around the technology used in agriculture. Creating spin-off ideas fits well with our discussion of divergent thinking and brainstorming. Through these processes, we can discover new uses for existing technology, just as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_term80" group-by="R">Ring</span> did by using video technology to add security by allowing customers to see who is at the door without opening it.</p>

          <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm405618336">In the agriculture industry, insects, weeds, weather conditions, and the challenges of harvesting crops are all ripe for entrepreneurial activities. The move toward organic produce has also affected this industry. From an entrepreneurial perspective, what products could you invent to support both organic farming and the problems of insects that damage or destroy crops? The old method was to use chemical sprays to kill the insects, but today, the growing demand for organic foods and increased awareness of the impact of chemical sprays on our environment are changing this scenario. One new idea to solve this problem combines a vacuum cleaner with an agriculture product.</p>

          <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm398572464">A bug vacuum is an example of how using divergent thinking contributed to the solution of removing bugs from crops without using chemicals. In the group activity of creating divergent ideas, this idea may not have been received well. However, in the incubation stage, the idea must have come forward as a viable solution. Entrepreneurs frequently face the challenge of pressure to conform to established habits and patterns within industries.</p>
          <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm408142080" class="has-noteref">Often, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_term82" group-by="e">entrepreneurial mindset</span> includes futuristic ideas that shake up the normal, conventional processes that are grounded in experience over time. Tried-and-tested processes and products that have a proven history of success can be a formidable obstacle to new ideas. A new idea may even appear as impossible or outlandish, perhaps even an embarrassment to the steady and predictable practices established within an industry. This can create a dilemma: Do we try something new and unproven that lacks documented research? Sometimes, we must disregard our past successes and research to be open to new possibilities for success and failure. An entrepreneurial mindset includes creativity, problem-solving skills, and a propensity to innovation.<a href="#auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm390663408" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">23</a> Open-mindedness is one characteristic that supports creativity, problem solving, and innovation. Taking the time to explore new ideas, dream, reflect, and view situations from a new perspective contribute to the entrepreneurial mindset. Some innovations can lead to disruptions within the industry, or even create a new industry.</p>

If you have a spare bedroom that you aren&#x2019;t using, why not sell that space to someone who wants and needs the space?</p>
          <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm391816336" class="has-noteref">Airbnb has become a significant threat to the established hotel industry&#x2019;s business model of building large hotels and renting rooms within those hotels to their customers. Airbnb has reconfigured that model, and since its 2008 launch, 150 million travelers have taken advantage of 3 million Airbnb listings in more than 191 countries. Airbnb has raised more than $3 billion (plus a $1 billion credit line) and is considering selling stocks to support significant expansion. The value of Airbnb is approximately $30 billion. Compare this market value to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_term86" group-by="H">Hilton</span>&#x2019;s market capitalization of $19 billion and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="auto_page_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_term87" group-by="M">Marriott</span>&#x2019;s of $35 billion. If you were the CEO of Hilton or Marriott, would you be worried? The hotel industry recognized Airbnb as a threat, and in 2016, began a campaign to create legislation to rein in Airbnb&#x2019;s growth and popularity. From the hotel industry&#x2019;s perspective, Airbnb is not playing by the same rules. This is the definition of disruptive technology, the focus on creating a new idea or process that negates or challenges established process or products.<a href="#auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm372847712" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">24</a></p>

          <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm387432736">Sometimes disruptive technologies result from <em data-effect="italics">not</em> listening to customers. Customers don&#x2019;t always know what they want. Customer groups might need to be redefined by the entrepreneurial team on the basis of better models, knowing when to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins while still satisfying the need, and knowing when to pursue small markets at the expense of larger or established markets. Basically, disruptive technologies occur through identifying new and valuable processes and products.</p>
          <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm409471904">The founders of Airbnb recognized that some people have unused resources, bedrooms, that other people need. We can apply this idea to other unused resources such as vehicles and motor homes. We see this model reproduced in short-term car rental and bike-sharing programs.</p>

          <p id="auto_d51e5dbd-ff69-4828-a882-9c6e8a940365_fs-idm343555472">An entrepreneur is someone who takes on an entrepreneurial venture to create something new that solves a problem; small business ownership and franchising are also entrepreneurial options. The venture could be for profit or not for profit, depending on the problem it intends to solve. Entrepreneurs can remain in a full-time job while pursuing their ideas on the side, in order to mitigate risk. On the opposite end of the spectrum, entrepreneurs can take on lifestyle ventures and become serial entrepreneurs. There are many factors driving the growth of entrepreneurship, including employment instability, motivation to create something new, financial factors and free time associated with retirement, and the greater acceptance of entrepreneurship as a career choice. The cultures of nations around the world affect the ability for entrepreneurs to start a venture, making the United States a leader in entrepreneurial innovation. Entrepreneurs often find inspiration in social, environmental, and economic issues.</p>

          <p id="auto_7ccc54a5-2430-429f-b74e-c94732f87418_fs-idm327774096">Establishing an entrepreneurial vision helps you describe what you want your venture to become in the future. For most entrepreneurial ventures, the vision also includes the harvesting or selling of the venture. There are creative ways, such as brainstorming and divergent thinking, as well as investigative ways to define an entrepreneurial vision. Once you have established your vision, it is important to write goals to help you realize the steps toward making your vision a reality.</p>

          <p id="auto_eca9a0ef-7ef7-47d3-abaf-ce21ce92452d_fs-idm368257280">Identifying new possibilities, solving problems, and improving the quality of life on our planet are all important aspects of entrepreneurship. The entrepreneurial mindset allows an entrepreneur to view the world as full of possibilities. Entrepreneurial passion and spirit help entrepreneurs overcome obstacles to achieve their goals. Disruptive technologies involve using existing technology in new ways and can provide new opportunities as well as new challenges. Entrepreneurship is transforming some industries and potentially creating others, though many entrepreneurs create value by starting small businesses, buying franchises, or introducing new services in mature industries. The key thing to remember is that anyone can be an entrepreneur and that new technologies are making the cost of starting a new business less costly, but still risky at some level.</p>
