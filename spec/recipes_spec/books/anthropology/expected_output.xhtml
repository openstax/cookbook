The authors take a balanced approach to micro-and macroeconomics, to both Keynesian and classical views, and to the theory and application of economics concepts. The text also includes many current examples, which are handled in a politically equitable way. The second edition has been thoroughly revised to increase clarity, update data and current event impacts, and incorporate the feedback from many reviewers and adopters. </p>

These knowledgeable instructors informed the pedagogical courses, learning objective development and fulfillment, and the chapter arrangements. Faculty who taught from the material provided critical and detailed commentary.</p>

          <ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-679">
            <li><strong>What is Economics?</strong>  The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on making choices in a world of scarce resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Supply and Demand</strong>, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.</li>
            <li><strong>The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory</strong>, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics portion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different models of market structure, including some simple game theory.</li>
            <li><strong>Microeconomic Policy Issues</strong>, Chapters 11 through 18, covers the range of topics in applied micro, framed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities.  Students explore competition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor market issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, as well as public economy.</li>
            <li><strong>The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals</strong>, Chapters 19 through 23, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows.</li>
            <li><strong>A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis</strong>, Chapters 24 through 26, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.  The model is then applied to the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives.  The expenditure-output model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.</li>
            <li><strong>Monetary and Fiscal Policy</strong>, Chapters 27 through 31, explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary policy and financial regulation.  Then the discussion switches to government deficits and fiscal policy.</li>
            <li><strong>International Economics</strong>, Chapters 32 through 34, the final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 data-type="title">Changes to the second edition</h4>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-272">OpenStax only undertakes revisions when significant modifications to a text are necessary. In the case of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, we received a wealth of constructive feedback.  Many of the book&#x2019;s users felt that consequential movement in economic data, coupled with the impacts of national and global events, warranted a full revision. We also took advantage of the opportunity to improve the writing and sequencing of the text, as well as many of the calculation examples. The major changes are summarized below.</p>
          <ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-447">
            <li>Augmented explanations in chapters one through four provide a more comprehensive and informative foundation for the book. </li>
            <li>A clearer explanation, using a numerical example, has been given for finding the utility maximizing combination of goods and services a consumer should choose.</li>
            <li>The Theory of Production has been added to the chapter on costs &amp; industry structure.</li>
            <li> A more complete treatment has been given to labor markets, including the theories of competitive and monopsonistic labor markets, and bilateral monopoly; and the labor markets chapter and the poverty and
economic inequality chapter have been resequenced.</li>
            <li>Substantial revisions to the AD/AS model in chapters 24-26 present the core concepts of macroeconomics in a clearer, more dynamic manner. </li>
            <li>Case studies and examples have been revised and, in some cases, replaced to provide more relevant and useful information for students.</li>
            <li>Economic data, tables, and graphs, as well as discussion and analysis around that data, have been thoroughly updated.</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-318">Wherever possible, data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) was included and referenced.  In most of these uses, links to the direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged to explore the information and the overall FRED resources more thoroughly.

</p>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-594">Additional updates and revisions appear throughout the book.  They reflect changes to economic realities and policies regarding international trade, taxation, insurance, and other topics.  For issues that may change in the months or years following the textbook's publication, the authors often provided a more open-ended explanation, but we will update the text annually to address further changes. </p>
          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-204">The revision of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> was undertaken by Steven Greenlaw (University of Mary Washington) and David Shapiro (Pennsylvania State University), with significant input by lead reviewer Daniel MacDonald (California State University, San Bernardino).</p>

          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-987">Throughout the OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em>, you will find new features that engage the students in economic inquiry by taking selected topics a step further. Our features include:
</p>
          <ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-213">
            <li><strong>Bring It Home:</strong> This added feature is a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter&#x2019;s main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts:  the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the intro module) and the second at chapter&#x2019;s end, when students have learned what&#x2019;s necessary to understand the case and &#x201C;bring home&#x201D; the chapter&#x2019;s core concepts.</li>
            <li><strong>Work It Out:</strong> This added feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them step by step to find out how its solution is derived. </li>
            <li><strong>Clear It Up:</strong> This boxed feature, which includes pre-existing features from Taylor&#x2019;s text, addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts with a question.  The rest of the feature explains the answer.</li>
            <li><strong>Link It Up:</strong> This added feature is a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students&#x2019; understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.  </li>
          </ul>

          <p id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-454">The OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics 2e</em> further expands on Taylor&#x2019;s original end of chapter materials by offering four types of end of module questions for students:
</p>
          <ul id="auto_82b09d28-4b90-432c-8932-b2e7b1791c98_eip-284">
            <li><strong>Self-Checks</strong> are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They &#x201C;click to reveal&#x201D; an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think beyond what is said in the text.  Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through the problem.  </li>
            <li><strong>Review Questions</strong> have been retained from Taylor&#x2019;s version, and are simple recall questions from the chapter in open-response format (not multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text. </li>
            <li><strong>Critical Thinking Questions</strong> are new higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to <em data-effect="italics">demonstrate their understanding by applying</em> what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for outside-the-box thinking, for <em data-effect="italics">reasoning</em> about the concepts. They push the student to places they wouldn&#x2019;t have thought of going themselves.  </li>
            <li><strong>Problems</strong> are exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and computational concepts in the module. </li>
          </ul>

        <p id="auto_f075c301-5582-4589-b03f-af97f94ae363_eip-865">Social scientists commonly refer to social norms and behaviors&#x2014;for example, as explored in Chapter 1, the ways that individuals are assigned to racial categories and what these categories mean about an individual&#x2019;s place within that society&#x2014;as <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_f075c301-5582-4589-b03f-af97f94ae363_term2" group-by="s">socio-cultural constructions</span>. Such norms and behaviors create categories and rules according to social criteria (not biological truths) and thus vary across cultures. <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_f075c301-5582-4589-b03f-af97f94ae363_term3" group-by="K">Kinship</span> is another socio-cultural construction.  Although kinship, like gender and age, is a universal concept in human societies (meaning that all societies have some means of defining kinship), the specific &#x201C;rules&#x201D; about who is related, and how closely, vary widely.  Depending on the way kinship is determined, two individuals who would call each other father and son in one cultural group may not even consider themselves to be related in another group. </p>
        <p id="auto_f075c301-5582-4589-b03f-af97f94ae363_delete_me">The common assumptions that kinship is static and created by biological relationships reveals the strength of socio-cultural constructs in our lives. It is culture, and not biology, that tells us whom our closest relatives are. Biology relies on genetics, but kinship is determined by culture. One interesting and very familiar example of the socio-cultural dimension of kinship is the practice of adoption, through which those who have no genetic relationship to one another are considered both legally and culturally to become family. Biological relatedness is determined at the genetic level. This form of specialized knowledge, which has primarily been a specialized concern of Western societies, typically has little meaning in our day-to-day lives, except within legal and economic contexts where paternity or maternity may be in question. Otherwise, across history and cultures, including within our own society today, family are those we live with, rely on, and love. Those individuals, whether or not they have a specific genetic relationship to us, are those we refer to using family terms of reference &#x2013; my mother, my son, my aunt. </p>
        <p id="auto_f075c301-5582-4589-b03f-af97f94ae363_eip-577">The study of kinship is central to anthropology. It provides deep insights into human relationships and alliances, including those who can and cannot marry, mechanisms that are used to create families, and even the ways social and economic resources are dispersed within a group. One of the earliest studies of kinship was completed by Lewis Henry Morgan (1818-1881), an amateur American anthropologist, in the mid nineteenth century. Intrigued by the cultural diversity of various Iroquois peoples living in upstate New York, Morgan began to document differences in kinship terminology between cultural groups, based on historical accounts and surveys from missionaries working in other geographical locations. As he gathered information on the diverse ways family was defined across these cultures, he arranged the kinship systems in evolutionary order from simple to complex. In <em data-effect="italics">Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family</em> (1871), he defined three of the primary kinship systems that we still recognize today, identifying each with either descriptive kinship terms such as &#x201C;mother&#x2019;s sister&#x2019;s son,&#x201D; or classificatory terms, which group diverse relationships under a single term, such as &#x201C;cousin.&#x201D; Although Morgan used different names, today we know these three systems as lineal kinship, bifurcate merging kinship, and generational kinship. The publication of his book marked the beginning of kinship studies in anthropology.

        <p id="auto_f075c301-5582-4589-b03f-af97f94ae363_eip-589">Following Morgan,  kinship became increasingly central to the way anthropologists examined other cultures. W.H.R. Rivers (1864-1922) introduced the genealogical method in fieldwork in a 1910 article, &#x201C;The Genealogical Method in Anthropological Query.&#x201D; Using a series of basic questions about parents, grandparents, and siblings, Rivers approached the study of kinship as a systematic inquiry into the social structure of societies, seeking to understand how different cultures define family and family roles.  Although he focused on small-scale societies, he argued that investigating kinship was a good way of establishing rapport with people and opening them up to sharing more detailed information about their lives regardless of the size of the society. Today, ethnographers continue to use a form of the genealogical method, either through face-to-face interviews or surveys, especially when doing fieldwork in small-scale societies. In this way, the ethnographer seeks to understand the socio-cultural relationships in society and the ways that family affects those relationships.
</p>
        <p id="auto_f075c301-5582-4589-b03f-af97f94ae363_eip-269">In the 1920s, British anthropologists Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942) and A.R. Radcliffe-Brown (1881-1955) expanded the understanding of kinship as a social institution by studying the ways that kinship intersected with other institutions in society, such as inheritance, education, politics, and subsistence. Malinowski did fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea, a matrilineal society where descent and inheritance were traced solely through mothers and grandmothers. In his work <em data-effect="italics">Argonauts of the Western Pacific</em> (1922), he examined the functional role of kinship in Trobriand society, exploring how it works with other social institutions to address basic needs. Expanding kinship exploration beyond its early beginnings as a study of linguistic terminology only, Malinowski (1930:22) says, &#x201C;kinship terminologies&#x2026;are the most active and the most effective expressions of human relationship, expressions which start in early childhood, which accompany human intercourse throughout life, which embody all the most personal, passionate, and intimate sentiments of a man or woman.&#x201D; He saw kinship as a driving force connecting individuals to each other by means of enduring bonds. A.R. Radcliffe-Brown also focused on kinship as a social institution in his study <em data-effect="italics">The Andaman Islanders</em> (1922), but instead of looking at the function of kinship, Radcliffe-Brown examined the roles and statuses created for an individual by the practice of kinship.
</p>
        <p id="auto_f075c301-5582-4589-b03f-af97f94ae363_eip-172">Through these early studies in kinship, anthropologists began to better understand the diverse ways that cultural groups think about things like family and community. Kinship relationships determine both rights and obligations to other people. These connections contribute to the way a society functions and resolve problems associated with everyday life. In small-scale societies with low population density, kinship identity plays a significant role in most of the life choices an individual will have, while in larger-scale societies, kinship plays a smaller and more limited role. In all societies, however, kinship provides guidelines on how to interact with certain other individuals and the expectations that are associated with these relationships.
</p>
        <p id="auto_f075c301-5582-4589-b03f-af97f94ae363_eip-386">Cultures call attention to kinship relationships through the way people speak to and refer to one another. Anthropologists sort this kinship terminology into two categories: <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_f075c301-5582-4589-b03f-af97f94ae363_term4" group-by="t">terms of reference</span> and <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_f075c301-5582-4589-b03f-af97f94ae363_term5" group-by="t">terms of address</span>. Terms of reference are the words that are used to describe the relationship between individuals, such as &#x201C;mother,&#x201D; &#x201C;grandfather,&#x201D; or &#x201C;father&#x2019;s brother.&#x201D; Terms of address are the terms people use to speak directly to their kin, such as &#x201C;Mom,&#x201D; &#x201C;Uncle,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Grandpa.&#x201D; Sometimes the same word is used as reference and address: &#x201C;This is my father&#x201D; and &#x201C;Hello, Father.&#x201D; These terms are important because they designate relationships between individuals that carry responsibilities and privileges that structure human societies. </p>

It frequently, but not always, involves the reproduction and care of offspring and co-residence within the same locale. Families vary greatly across cultures and also adapt to changing social and economic needs. Sometimes families aggregate into larger units for short periods to meet challenging needs, such as eldercare, illness, job loss, transition between college and career, etc. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_term7" group-by="h">household</span> is a group of individuals who live within the same residence and share socio-economic needs associated with production and consumption. A family and a household may be the same unit, but they do not have to be. Sometimes families live within larger households, where there may be two or more families residing; at other times a family may be physically separated as family members migrate to work or study temporarily in other locations.</p>
        <p id="auto_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_eip-345">Like the concept of kinship, family is a socio-cultural construct. Family is defined and recognized differently across cultures, according to differing social norms. Some cultures consider families to be only those people believed to be related to each other, living together, and sharing similar goals, while other cultures define family as a disperse set of individuals with an ancestral history. The definition of family that a cultural group endorses reflects such things as kinship and the social interpretation of biology, cultural traditions and norms, and socio-emotional ties. It is commonly scaled from the intimate unit in which children are raised to a larger, more amorphous web of relatives.
</p>
        <p id="auto_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_eip-859">In the U.S. today, we commonly perceive the intimate family to be a nuclear unit of parents and their immediate offspring living together in a household, while the larger family is a loose collection of relatives with varying degrees of perceived kinship, from those we refer to as blood relatives (<em data-effect="italics">consanguine</em>) to those who have married into the family (<em data-effect="italics">affine</em>). Among the Munduruc&#xFA; in the lowland Amazonia of Brazil, the resident family includes only the mother and her pre-adolescent offspring, while the father resides in the tribal men&#x2019;s house. Among the Mosuo of China (also called the Na), women form temporary sexual alliances with men from outside of their families to produce offspring and then remain with their brothers in their own households to raise their children. The children are considered to be part of the women&#x2019;s lineage unit and family, which typically excludes even the recognition of the children&#x2019;s biological father. </p>

          <p id="auto_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_eip-265">
Anthropologists graphically illustrate relationships between family members with kinship charts (also called kinship diagrams), which use as their starting point the perspective of a single individual identified as EGO. The term <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_term8" group-by="E">EGO</span> identifies the person whose chart is depicted. EGO marks the starting point for the kinship chart and relationships are read as alignments between EGO and other individuals. The sum of kinship relationships identified through EGO is referred to as EGO&#x2019;s <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_term9" group-by="k">kindred</span>. Serving as a map and model, the kinship chart can be &#x201C;read&#x201D; like a text, with its own syntax and grammar identifying each individual within a society by means of their relatedness to each other.

          <p id="auto_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_eip-281">Kinship charts depict two types of relationships, consanguineal and affinal.

An <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_term11" group-by="a">affinal tie</span> depicts a contractual relationship by marriage or mutual agreement and is drawn as a double line. Such ties usually can be broken, and if they are, a forward slash will be struck though the double line.

These concurrent ties with more than one family involve descent rules (how an individual traces relatedness across generations), residence rules (where an individual will live following marriage), and, in some societies, even remarriage rules (how marriage will be reinstated following the death of a spouse). We will look at each of these later in the chapter.

          <p id="auto_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_eip-643">
Although family is difficult to categorize because of its diversity, anthropologists have defined four basic family types that are duplicated across cultures with minor variations.  Each of these types is adapted to the social and economic needs of the family unit and is normally associated with particular subsistence strategies. Under stress, some families will change types to address immediate needs, such as a loss of independent living by elderly parents. Regardless of its type, the family unit is a remarkably adaptive cultural mechanism.

            <p id="auto_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_eip-232">
Also known as a single-couple family, a nuclear family is composed of one or two parents and their immediate offspring. It is the smallest family structure and is often found in societies where geographic mobility is valued. The nuclear family is common in small-scale foraging societies (bands) and industrial/post-industrial and market societies (states), both settings in which subsistence activities require families to relocate with some regularity. Although the model of the American nuclear family consisting of a two-parent household with one or more children has become less typical over the last several generations, it continues to be a norm. As of the 2016 Census, 69% of U.S. children under the age of 18 were living in a two-parent household, a decrease from 88% in 1960. </p>

The <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_term13" group-by="e">extended family</span> can be very complex. It includes two or more family units functioning as a single integrated family. It may involve three or more generations (e.g. grandparents, parents, and children), or polygamous families with multiple spouses and their offspring, or married siblings living together with their children, a type of extended family known as joint families. The extended family can be an effective social and economic unit because it involves multiple adults able to contribute to the household. Extended families have been most commonly associated with agricultural societies, where a high value is typically placed on labor and self-subsistence. In the U.S. today, we commonly see the emergence of the extended family during times of transition, such as when family members are changing jobs, returning to school, or recovering from economic hardship. Worldwide, the extended family is the most common type of family.

In the 2016 U.S. Census, 23% of children under 18 lived in a female single-headed household (mother), almost triple the number living in female single households in 1960 (8%), and there was also an increase in children under 18 living in male single households (father), from 1% in 1960 to 4% in 2016 (census.gov 2016; Pew Research 2019). Another growing nontraditional family type is same-sex families. These may or may not include children. In the 2020 Census, 14.7% of the 1.1 million same-sex couples in the U.S. had at least one child under 18 in their household (census.gov 2020).

Fictive kinship is based on intentional relationships such as adoption, godparenthood, or other intimate personal ties. Adoption of children is widespread across cultures, sometimes constituted legally, but more often through informal structures of support and sponsorship. There were an estimated 1.5 million adopted children under 18 in the U.S. in 2019, about 1 out of every 50 children, and adoption is increasing, especially among same-sex couples. In 2019, 43.3% of children of same-sex couples were adopted or stepchildren. </p>

        <p id="auto_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_eip-260">Across cultures, informal adoption and foster-care have long been practiced to strengthen families and provide opportunities for young people. Anthropological studies in West Africa, Oceania, Latin America, and in minority communities in North America document the prevalence of these practices, as well as their benefits and risks. In general, cultures which see social relationships as open and fluid are able to provide a greater range of opportunities to children.  One common form of informal adoption relocates children from rural birth families to relatives living in urban areas, where they have more opportunities for education, employment, and career training. Sometimes informal fostering helps to provide caretaking for shorter periods of time. A family may send an older child to temporarily live with a relative or even a friend who has a new infant or is facing a family crisis. These relationships may be mutually beneficial, allowing older children to meet new people and develop a wider network of friends and relatives. Historically, these fictive kinship ties have played a major role in family security and in creating stronger social ties between families, some of which may provide future educational, work, and career opportunities.</p>

        <p id="auto_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_eip-900">One form of voluntary fictional kinship is a type of  godparent relationship called <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_term17" group-by="c">compadrazgo</span>. Originally developed as a social institution within the Catholic Church, a Catholic child or young person receives godparents as an infant during the ritual of baptism. These godparents are selected by the child&#x2019;s parents as role models to encourage their child in religious instruction and living a &#x201C;godly&#x201D; life. Godparents are most frequently chosen from among the child&#x2019;s relatives, thus <em data-effect="italics">reinforcing kinship ties</em>. </p>
        <p id="auto_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_eip-773">When the Spanish and Portuguese empires introduced this institution into Latin America following the 16th-century conquest and imposition of Catholicism, godparenthood was adapted to meet the particular needs of populations suffering from disease, warfare, and mass casualties. These social disruptions often left children without parents who were able to adequately take care of them. In such a setting, children&#x2019;s godparents shifted from being chosen from among relatives to being selected from friends and acquaintances. This use of  fictive kin relationships served as an extension of family for a child and <em data-effect="italics">created new kinship ties</em> between families not previously related. It created a contract (Foster 1961) between the godparents (who referred to the child as <em data-effect="italics">ahijado/a</em>), the child (who referred to his or her godparents as <em data-effect="italics">padrino</em> and <em data-effect="italics">madrina</em>), and the parents (who, along with the godparents referred to each other as <em data-effect="italics">compadre</em> and <em data-effect="italics">comadre</em>) that provided an ever-widening social network.
</p>
        <p id="auto_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_eip-365">Over time, the practice of compadrazgo adapted to the specific needs of this new cultural setting and became more complex. There is a symmetrical form in which parents choose friends and coworkers of their same socio-economic status to serve as godparents for their children and also an asymmetrical form in which parents contract with individuals/couples who are in a higher class or status group to provide opportunities for their child. This form functions very similarly to a social security system and many of the upper classes see it as their Christian duty to sponsor a large number of godchildren within their communities or workplaces. </p>
        <p id="auto_c09f1ec4-70d2-4daf-94fb-432fad07665d_eip-735">In addition, compadrazgo extends beyond religious rituals into secular society, including the practice of naming compadres for such things as a child&#x2019;s first haircut or the purchase of a new house, or even, in smaller communities, compadrazgo as the ritual sponsorship of community buildings or initiatives. In 1980 in Ica, Peru, the installation of a new water tower included the designation of <em data-effect="italics">compadres</em>. For those serving as compadres, there is an enhancement of social status in Latin America. Over a lifetime, individuals typically have a series of new and expanding compadrazgo relationships, gaining new compadres through life changes such as marriage, the birth of children, and sometimes even the acquisition of expensive material items. While these relationships may change over time &#x2013; for example when a child has become an adult the birth compadres may no longer send gifts and offer advice &#x2013; the relationships themselves endure as (fictive) family connections and the respect and acknowledgement of the relationship remains important to all of the individuals involved in the compadrazgo family.

This is the institutional aspect of kinship and it is bigger than the family itself. In smaller societies, those with lower population, kinship plays a major role in all social institutions, while in larger societies, those with higher population, kinship places the local and familiar in opposition to a wider more amorphous society, where relationships have less and less significance. In effect, kinship frames the way the individual and family are viewed in relation to the larger society and embodies social values.</p>
        <p id="auto_54069215-0bf4-41cf-87f8-77b2b1bfe858_eip-394">The common assumptions that kinship is static and created by biological relationships reveals the strength of socio-cultural constructs in our lives. It is culture, and not biology, that tells us whom our closest relatives are. Biology relies on genetics, but kinship is determined by culture. One interesting and very familiar example of the socio-cultural dimension of kinship is the practice of adoption, through which those who have no genetic relationship to one another are considered both legally and culturally to become family. Biological relatedness is determined at the genetic level. This form of specialized knowledge, which has primarily been a specialized concern of Western societies, typically has little meaning in our day-to-day lives, except within legal and economic contexts where paternity or maternity may be in question. Otherwise, across history and cultures, including within our own society today, family are those we live with, rely on, and love. Those individuals, whether or not they have a specific genetic relationship to us, are those we refer to using family terms of reference &#x2013; my mother, my son, my aunt.

        <p id="auto_54069215-0bf4-41cf-87f8-77b2b1bfe858_eip-474">In his early research, Lewis Henry Morgan distinguished three basic forms of kinship structure found commonly across cultures. Today, we refer to these kinship forms as lineal, bifurcate merging, and generational kinship. Each one defines family and relatives a bit differently and so highlights different roles, rights, and responsibilities for these individuals. This means that depending on the kinship structure used by a society, EGO will refer to a different set of individuals as kindred and will have a different relationship with those individuals.

While kindred in a lineal system is traced both through EGO&#x2019;s mother and father (a practice called bilateral descent), the kinship terminology clearly shows that the rights and responsibilities of the nuclear family far exceed those of other kindred. In effect, lineal kinship, associated frequently with North American and European societies, suggests a very small and nominal family with little power and influence across other social institutions.

Figure 12.9 depicts bifurcate merging kinship with unilineal descent (either patrilineal or matrilineal). This means that once descent is introduced into the diagram, EGO&#x2019;s relationships, with associated rights and responsibilities, will shift towards either the mother&#x2019;s or father&#x2019;s side. This form of kinship reckoning, quite common to tribal societies, is found extensively, and creates a distinction between the family of orientation, which is merged together from various lines, and other relatives, who are bifurcated, or cut away.

As an example, while EGO knows who his biological mother is (the woman who gave birth to him), his relationship with his biological mother has the same rights and responsibilities as his relationship with his mother&#x2019;s sister(s), etc. Notice also that the category of individuals lumped together as &#x201C;cousins&#x201D; under the lineal diagram are here distinguished depending on EGO&#x2019;s relationship with their parent. EGO&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s sisters are called &#x201C;mother&#x201D; and his father&#x2019;s brothers are called &#x201C;father,&#x201D; which means that any of their offspring would be EGO&#x2019;s brothers or sisters. Notice, though, that the mothers and fathers highlighted outside of EGO&#x2019;s biological parents are married to non-kin members; EGO does not refer to his mother&#x2019;s sister&#x2019;s husband as father &#x2013; he is referred to as &#x201C;mother&#x2019;s husband&#x201D;. Mother&#x2019;s brothers and father&#x2019;s sisters produce offspring who are bifurcated and lumped as &#x201C;cousin.&#x201D; Anthropologists distinguish between <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_54069215-0bf4-41cf-87f8-77b2b1bfe858_term21" group-by="p">parallel cousins</span> (EGO&#x2019;s brothers and sisters through his parents&#x2019; same-sex siblings) and <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_54069215-0bf4-41cf-87f8-77b2b1bfe858_term22" group-by="c">cross cousins</span> (EGO&#x2019;s cousins through his parents&#x2019; opposite-sex siblings). In many tribal societies, EGO would choose his (or her) marriage partner from among his (or her) cross cousins, thereby merging their children back into a primary kinship line. In this way, the family unit (the kindred) maintains a stable and significant presence across generations.

Widespread in Polynesia, especially during the times of chiefdom societies, generational kinship provides a distinction in kinship term only along gender and generational lines. Generational kinship has the least complicated kinship terminology of all kinship systems, but the impact of creating a family of orientation this large and powerful is immediately apparent. In reading this chart, it is obvious that the intimate family was as large as could be configured and it would have significant socio-political impact within the society.

Descent, the ways that families trace their kinship connections between generations of ancestors and generations-to-come, is a primary factor in the delineation of kinship structures. Through descent, the individual highlights certain particular relationships with kindred and drops or leaves off other possible relationships. Descent, ultimately, determines such things as inheritance, alliance, and marriage rules. There are two common ways that a cultural group can trace descent across generations:</p>

        <p id="auto_54069215-0bf4-41cf-87f8-77b2b1bfe858_eip-962">The Navajo are among the most populous of the indigenous, aboriginal peoples in the U.S., exceeding 325,000 members, with roughly half living in the Navajo Nation. Covering some 25,000 square miles, the Navajo Nation crosses New Mexico and Arizona in its autonomous jurisdiction. Traditionally a matrilineal society, the Navajo trace descent and inheritance through their mothers and grandmothers. Such a descent pattern would normally lead to the establishment of matrilocal households, with daughters bringing their husbands to live with or near their matrilineal kin following marriage.
</p>
        <p id="auto_54069215-0bf4-41cf-87f8-77b2b1bfe858_eip-159">In his study of the contemporary Shonto Navajo, however, William Yewdale Adams (1983), an anthropologist who spent part of his childhood living on the Navajo Reservation, found that while matrilocal residence remained the ideal for Navajo families, it was not followed any more frequently than patrilocal residence (living with or near the groom&#x2019;s father), and neolocal residence (a separate independent household) was also practiced across the Nation. When job opportunities and economic choices necessitated that families live in different areas, they adapted. When families became large and less manageable as a socio-economic unit, they might splinter into smaller units, some into nuclear families living alone. While the ideal Navajo family type endured as part of their identity, the actual everyday practices of families depended on their particular circumstances and might change over the course of their lives. To outsiders, these may seem to be old traditions with little value, but during major life events, such as marriage and childbirth, it is the matrilineal family which will most support the couple by providing resources and any needed labor and help. Matrilineal descent also elevates the role of women in society, not by excluding men, but by recognizing the vital roles that women play in the establishment of both family and society.

        <p id="auto_54069215-0bf4-41cf-87f8-77b2b1bfe858_fs-idm260406384">Traditionally, the Navajo constructed houses (called hogans) made of timber or stone frames covered with earth (Haile 1942). There are multiple types of hogans, including a male hogan, which is conically shaped and used for more private rituals, and a female hogan, which is circular and large enough to accommodate the whole family. Although today most Navajo live in Western-style homes with electricity and running water, many families still construct one or more hogans for ritual and ceremony. For families that continue traditional Navajo ceremonies, the most common hogan form today is the female hogan. As Adams aptly argues, the Navajo are very much like other societies in regard to kinship &#x2013; while it defines an ideal within Navajo society, its primary function is to provide &#x201C;possibilities and boundaries&#x201D; around which individuals will construct kinship (1983:412). It adapts to the changing environment and the needs of family.

Depending on the society, it may be a union between a man and a woman, any two adults (regardless of their gender), or between multiple spouses in polygamous societies. While marriages are most commonly established in order to provide a formal structure in which to raise and nurture offspring (whether biological or adopted/fostered), all marriages do not involve children.  While there are variations of marriage, the institution itself, with some few notable exceptions, is universal across cultures. Marriage is an effective means of addressing several common challenges within families: it provides a structure in which to reproduce, raise, and nurture offspring; it reduces competition among and between males and females; and it creates a stable, long-term socio-economic household in which the family unit can more adequately subsist with shared labor and resources.
</p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-186">Defining marriage can be complex. In the southern Andes of Peru and Bolivia, indigenous people begin marriage with a practice  known as <em data-effect="italics">servinakuy</em> (with spelling variations). In <em data-effect="italics">servinakuy</em> a man and woman establish their own independent household with very little formal social acknowledgement and live together until the birth of their first child, after which they are formally considered to be a fully married couple. Not a trial marriage and not considered informal cohabitation, <em data-effect="italics">servinakuy</em> is, instead, a prolonged marriage process during which family is created over time. Andean legal scholars argue that these unions should carry with them the legal rights and protections associated with a formal marriage from the time the couple begins living together (Ingar 2015).
</p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-371">Like all social institutions, ideas about marriage can adapt and change.  Within urban Western societies, the concept of marriage is undergoing a great deal of change as socio-economic opportunities shift and new opportunities open up for women.  In Iceland, in 2016, almost 70% of children were born outside of a marriage, usually to committed unmarried couples (Peng 2018). This trend is supported by national social policies that provide generous parental leave for both married individuals and those within a consensual union, but the change is also due to the more fluid nature of family today. As norms change in Iceland across generations, it will be interesting to see if the practiced form of consensual union we see today eventually comes to be considered a  sanctioned form of marriage.

Anthropologists group marriage customs into two primary types: a union of two spouses only (<em data-effect="italics">monogamy</em>) or a union involving more than two spouses (<em data-effect="italics">polygamy</em>). <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term34" group-by="M">Monogamy</span> is the socially sanctioned union of two adults. In some societies this union is restricted to a man and a woman, and in other societies it can be two adults of any sex. Monogamy, because it produces an overall smaller family unit, is especially well-adapted to post-industrial societies and also cultures where family units are highly mobile (such as nomadic foragers). <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term35" group-by="S">Serial monogamy</span> is a form of monogamy in which adults have a series of two-person monogamous marriages over a lifetime. This is increasingly common in Western societies, but it is also practiced in some small-scale societies, such as bands. In serial monogamy, divorce and remarriage are common.
</p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-109">In June 2015, in <em data-effect="italics">Obergefell v. Hodges</em>, the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in the U.S., following earlier legal recognitions in many other Western countries. Today, same-sex marriage is legal in 29 countries. While the movement to legalize same-sex marriage has been long and tumultuous in most of these countries, same sex marriages and unions have historically played significant roles in indigenous societies. In the U.S., anthropologists are familiar with the <em data-effect="italics">two-spirit</em> in some Native American groups. Two-spirit is a contemporary term used across indigenous societies in the U.S. to refer to individuals of a third gender, or gender-variant. Historically, Europeans used the word <em data-effect="italics">berdache</em>, a pejorative and inaccurate term. Each indigenous group has terms in their own languages to refer to this gender-fluid category (such as <em data-effect="italics">winkte</em>/Lakota, <em data-effect="italics">bat&#xE9;e</em>/Crow, and <em data-effect="italics">nadl&#xE9;eh</em>/Din&#xE9;, etc.). In many indigenous societies, individuals who claimed a third gender category formed stable marriages and families and were considered of worth, significance, and spiritual and ceremonial value for the group  (see Jacobi 2006).

In polygamous societies, families usually begin with a two-person marriage between a man and a woman. In some cases, the marriage will remain as a single couple for a long period of time or for the duration of their lives, because of lack of resources or availability of partners. Adding partners is frequently a sign of status and is considered an ideal for families in polygamous societies. In some cases, too, polygamy is practiced to address extreme social stress, due to things such as warfare or skewed population distributions caused by famine and high mortality rates. In her cross-cultural study of polygamy, cultural anthropologist Miriam Zeitzen (2008) noted a great deal of diversity within polygamy, from <em data-effect="italics">de jure</em> unions that are formal, legal contracts (such as is found in Gambia) to <em data-effect="italics">de facto</em> polygamy which may be just as enduring, stable, and acceptable within a society (such as is found in the Ivory Coast).

There are often marked age asymmetry in these relationships, with husbands much older than their wives. In polygynous households each wife commonly lives in her own house with her own biological children, but the family unit cooperates together to share resources and provide childcare. The husband usually &#x201C;visits&#x201D; his wives in succession and lives in each of their homes at various times (or lives apart in his own). It is common, also, for there to be a hierarchy of wives based on seniority. Polygyny is found worldwide and offers many benefits. It maximizes the family labor force and the shared resources and opportunities available for family members and creates wide kinship connections within society. Commonly in polygynous societies, larger families are afforded higher social status and they will have stronger political and economic alliances.
</p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-639">Polygyny is prevalent in Thailand today, with as  many as one in four Thai men between the ages of 30 and 50 having a second wife, called a <em data-effect="italics">mia noi</em> (minor wife). In her research in Thailand, cultural anthropologist Jiemin Bao (2008) studied polygyny among a group of <em data-effect="italics">lukchin</em> Thai (Thai of Chinese descent). She found that the <em data-effect="italics">lukchin</em> practiced polygynous marriages as a joint husband-and-wives economic enterprise, many times sending remittances back to family members still living in China.  Bao found that husbands frequently seek their wives&#x2019; consent before adding another wife and that the family overall considers polygyny to create greater economic opportunities for all family members, because multiple wives create a pool of stable  laborers with individual skillsets.. Even so, Bao observed turmoil and conflict within even economically successful polygynous families and observed that many marriages were conducted as if they were &#x201C;cutting a business deal&#x201D; (151). Gender politics of polygynous marriage among the <em data-effect="italics">lukchin</em> often left women with few choices except to work for her husband&#x2019;s family. Economic success for the family was culturally attributed to the male head of household and not his wives.

In polyandry, which is comparatively rare, there is one wife and more than one husband. Polyandrous marriages minimize population growth and may occur in societies where there is a temporary surfeit of males and scarcity of females. In <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term39" group-by="f">fraternal polyandry</span>, brothers marry a single wife. This is the most common type of polyandry in Nepal, although it is practiced by a minority of mainly rural families. Fraternal polyandry offers several benefits for societies like Nepal with scarce resources and dense population. Where there is extreme scarcity of land acreage, it allows brothers to share an inheritance of land instead of dividing it up. They can thus collectively subsist on the land as a family unit. Also, in areas where land is scattered over large distances, it allows brothers to take turns living away from home to tend herds of animals or fields and then spending time at home with their shared wife. It also minimizes reproduction and population growth in a society where there is a very dense population (Goldstein 1987).</p>

          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-69">
Following marriage, a couple begins a new family and establishes a shared residence, whether as a separate family unit or as part of an already-established family group. The social rules that determine where a newly married couple will reside are called <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term40" group-by="p">post-marital residence rules</span> and are directly related to the descent rules that operate in the society. These rules may be adapted due to extenuating circumstances such as economic need or lack of housing. In the U.S. today, for example, it is increasingly common for newly married couples to postpone the establishment of a separate household when work, schooling, or children create a need for familial support.
There are five post-marital residence patterns:
</p>
          <ul id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-413">
            <li>Under <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term41" group-by="n">neolocal residence</span>, a newly married couple establishes an independent household not connected to either spouse&#x2019;s family. This pattern of residence is mostly associated with bilateral descent. While this is a norm in our own society, during times of economic stress or familial need, couples in the U.S. do occasionally live in the household of one of the spouse&#x2019;s parents. </li>
            <li>More common worldwide is <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term42" group-by="p">patrilocal residence</span>, associated with societies practicing patrilineal descent. In patrilocal residence the newly married couple establishes their new household with or near the groom&#x2019;s father or the groom&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s relatives. What this means is that at marriage the groom remains within his household and/or family group, while the bride leaves her parents. Their future children will belong to the groom&#x2019;s lineage. </li>
            <li><span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term43" group-by="M">Matrilocal residence</span> is associated with societies practicing matrilineal descent. In matrilocal residence the newly married couple establishes their new household with or near the bride&#x2019;s mother or the bride&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s relatives. At marriage the bride remains within her household and/or family group, while the groom leaves his parents. Their future children will belong to the bride&#x2019;s lineage. </li>
            <li>Less frequent but also associated with matrilineal descent, is <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term44" group-by="a">avunculocal residence</span>, in which the newly married couple resides with or near the groom&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s brother. In societies that practice avunculocal residence the groom has commonly had a long-term relationship with his maternal uncle, who is part of his own mother&#x2019;s matriline. By joining with household of the groom&#x2019;s maternal uncle, the couple is able to benefit from both the husband&#x2019;s and the wife&#x2019;s matrilines. </li>
            <li>Under <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term45" group-by="a">ambilocal residence</span>, the couple decides which spouse&#x2019;s family to live with or near.  Ambilocal residence is associated with ambilineal descent. In ambilocal residence, the newly married couple will usually have made their decision about which spouse&#x2019;s family to join with prior to their marriage. Their future children will then trace descent through that particular line.<a href="#auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-idm222493632" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[footnote]</a><aside role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-idm222493632">I am a footnote.</aside></li>

          <h3 data-type="title">Marriage Compensation</h3>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-654">
In all cultures, marriage is a consequential matter not only to the adults immediately involved, but also to their families and to the broader community. In societies that practice unilineal descent, the newly married couple moves away from one family and toward another. This creates a disadvantage for the family that has &#x201C;lost&#x201D; a son or daughter. For example, in a patrilineal society, while the wife will remain a member of her birth lineage (that of her father), her children and her labor will now be invested mostly in her husband&#x2019;s lineage. As a result, in societies practicing unilineal descent, there is a <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term46" group-by="m">marriage compensation</span> from one family to the other for this perceived loss. Marriage compensation is the transfer of some form of wealth (in money, material goods, or labor) from one family to another to legitimate the marriage as a creation of a new social and economic household. It is not seen as payment for a spouse, but as recognition that the marriage and future children are part of one lineage rather than another (Stone 1998:77). There are several forms of marriage compensation, each symbolically marked by specific cultural practices.
</p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-558"><span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term47" group-by="B">Bride wealth</span> (also called bride price) is the transfer of material and symbolic value from the groom&#x2019;s to the bride&#x2019;s family. Depending on the cultural group, this may involve transfer of money, cattle, house goods, jewelry, or even symbolic ritual artifacts. Bride wealth is the most common form of marriage compensation across cultures In her study of the Thadou Kukis of northeast India, Burma, and Bangladesh, Indian sociologist Hoineilhing Sitlhou (2018) explores how bride wealth has changed over time. Historically, the items exchanged included cows, copper gongs, silver earrings, and ceremonial clothing for the bride&#x2019;s parents. Today, more contemporary items are offered, such as gold jewelry, cars, furniture, appliances, and land. One practice that has not changed is paying a portion of the bride wealth prior to the marriage ceremony and the remainder at some later point, so that the groom remains in respectful debt to the bride&#x2019;s family. In other societies, bride wealth must be paid in full before the marriage is considered legitimate. If marriages conducted using bride wealth end in divorce, normally the bride wealth (or equivalent value) is returned to the groom&#x2019;s family to signify the dissolution of the contract.
</p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-216">Similar to bride wealth, <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term48" group-by="b">bride service</span> involves a transfer of something of value from the groom&#x2019;s to the bride&#x2019;s family, but in this case the arrangement involves the contracted labor of the groom, whether before or after the marriage. Future grooms may work for months or years for the bride&#x2019;s family (usually her father&#x2019;s household) prior to the marriage or husbands may work for months or years with the bride&#x2019;s family after the marriage. In first case, the groom completes his service prior to the marriage and then moves with the bride back to his family after the marriage. In the second case, the newly married couple remains in residence with the bride&#x2019;s family until the service was concluded. The advantage of the second type of service is that frequently the wife is living with her mother when her first child (or children) is born. While her children are aligned with her husband&#x2019;s family as far as descent (and inheritance), her parents are able to support the couple and their first child or children for a period of time. </p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-495">The contractual obligations of bride wealth and bride service are not without conflict. In many unilineal societies, these obligations create a great deal of strife and conflict that can go on for years. What if the marriage is temperamentally difficult? What if the wife is barren or a child dies? What if the husband&#x2019;s family suffers economic challenges that create a disparity between what he can offer their family of procreation and what the wife&#x2019;s lineage could offer the children? Each of these situations creates conflict. Sometimes these conflicts between lineages (because marriage is seen as a contract with the larger family) spill over into the larger society and create larger social divisions.
</p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-705">An interesting example of bride service appears in the story of the marriage of Jacob to the sisters Leah and Rachel from the Christian Bible (Genesis 29). The Israelites were a patrilineal descent society, in which some men had polygynous marriages. Tricked by his father-in-law into marrying the eldest sister Leah, rather than the sister he preferred, Rachel, Jacob ends up taking both sisters as wives. He performs bride service for both, working for his father-in-law for 14 years in order to complete his bride service, 7 years for each of his wives. After completing his bride service, Jacob then takes his wives, children, and flocks and returns to his father&#x2019;s household, according to his culture&#x2019;s practice of patrilocal residence.
</p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-535"><span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term49" group-by="D">Dowry</span>, a third form of marriage compensation, functions differently than bride wealth and bride price. Dowry is a form of material value, such as money, jewelry, house goods, or family heirlooms, that the bride brings into her own marriage to provide her with wealth within her husband&#x2019;s lineage. In some societies women turn their dowry over to their husbands, but in other societies they retain rights to this wealth as a married woman. Among Nepalese Brahmans, sons inherit land and property equally at the death of the father, while women receive a dowry of clothing, jewelry, and household utensils from their own patriline at marriage (Stone 1998). They will use this wealth for status within the marriage. In other societies, women create a dual inheritance for their own daughters from their dowry, passing their dowry down through their daughters. Regardless of how the wealth is used, a woman&#x2019;s most stable route to higher status within a patrilineal society is through the birth of her sons. It is sons within the patriline who will bring wives into their father&#x2019;s household and increase the size and prominence of the patriline through the birth of their children. In patrilineal societies women with many sons typically carry a higher social status.

          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-255">While marriage compensation is most commonly associated with patrilineal societies, it is important to note that almost all marriages represent shared investments of one kind or another. Since marriage is the creation of a new family, spouses most often bring with them into their marriage their skills, traditions, and social networks, all of which carry symbolic weight within societies.

          <h3 data-type="title">Remarriage Obligations</h3>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-807">
The many rules and corresponding obligations specific to marriage in unilineal societies (such as residence rules and marriage compensation) are evidence that families and communities invest a great deal in marriages and the formation of new families. So what happens if a young and newly married spouse dies? What about the marriage compensation and the new household? In many unilineal societies (most especially in patrilineal societies), <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term50" group-by="r">remarriage obligations</span> ensure that in these cases the marriage contract endures. Remarriage obligations require the widowed spouse to remarry someone from the same lineage in order to maintain the stability of the family unit.
</p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-383">There are numerous issues that affect when and how remarriage obligations are enacted. The factors that most affect remarriage obligations are the ages of the spouses and amount of time that has passed since the marriage occurred, the ages of the offspring and whether there are young children within the family unit, and the particular marriage contract and value of the marriage compensation. Cultures (and families) determine how best to enact these rules within their own value systems and based on current need. But the primary underlying purpose of remarriage obligations is to maintain the alliance that was made between the two lineages at the time of the marriage. These are intended to be enduring ties that benefit all members of each lineage.
</p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-76">If the husband dies and there is a surviving wife (now, widow), under the <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term51" group-by="l">levirate</span> remarriage rule she will marry one of her husband&#x2019;s surviving brothers. While levirate will not be invoked in every case, it is quite common when there are young children remaining within the immediate family unit. Because levirate is usually practiced in societies with polygynous families, a married brother taking an additional wife will not disrupt his existing family and the new wife and her children will remain within the lineage where they were born.
</p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-761">The <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term52" group-by="s">sororate</span> applies to situations in which the wife dies and there is a surviving widower. Under this remarriage rule, the deceased wife&#x2019;s lineage must provide a replacement female, preferably the former wife&#x2019;s sister. If her sisters are already married or there are no sisters available, another female from the same lineage can be sent as a replacement. Sororate allows young children from the first marriage to remain with their father in his lineage and also maintain a symbolic and emotional bond with their biological mother&#x2019;s kindred.</p>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-40">Finally, there is also the highly variable practice of <span data-type="term" id="auto_page_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_term53" group-by="g">ghost marriage</span>, where a marriage is performed between one or two deceased individuals in order to create an alliance between lineages. Among the Dinka and Nuer of South Sudan, a ghost marriage is similar to the levirate, with the deceased husband&#x2019;s brother standing in for him in a ghost marriage. Unlike the levirate itself, any children from this second (ghost) marriage will be attributed to the deceased husband and not to the brother or the wider lineage itself. Among Chinese immigrants to Singapore, there are ghost marriage claims in which both spouses may be deceased (Schwartze 2010), continuing a tradition that began generations earlier (Topley 1955).

          <h3 data-type="title">Arranged Marriages</h3>
          <p id="auto_e7f690ce-7a8f-41a1-a3db-113965a30a7a_eip-470">
All marriages are arranged, whether between the spouses involved and/or their families, or through a third party. Today, an interesting adaptation of arranged marriages has developed involving online websites and hired marriage brokers to help individuals living in different countries find a suitable spouse from their birth culture. As transnational corporations spread worldwide, and individuals become more highly mobile (even nomadic) for work, finding a spouse who shares the same cultural values can be difficult. Although there are marriage brokers for many different cultural groups, there is a proliferation of matchmakers for individuals of Indian nationality or descent with names like the American Indian Matrimony Service in USA for Indians, Indian Marriage Bureau in USA, and Gujarati Marriage Bureau. As one site says, &#x201C;It is the dream of any Indian parent to see their sons and daughters get married to the person with whom they can stay happy the rest of their lives&#x201D; (desijodi.net). While not all of these sites are reputable, the explosion of marriage brokering businesses reminds us that marriage is, first and foremost, a cultural institution.

As a socio-cultural construction, it is defined differently across cultures to adapt to the specific needs of a society. While most of us think of kinship as a biological relationship, it is, in fact, a relationship defined by culture. Historically, anthropology approached the study of kinship as a collection of terms and relationships. Lewis Henry Morgan did early research on the diversity of kinship across societies. Bronislaw Malinowski and A.R. Radcliffe-Brown revealed kinship&#x2019;s institutional nature and how it connects to other aspects of social life, such as politics, economics, and subsistence. Today, anthropologists view kinship as one of the foundational social structures and institutions within a society. It defines the way an individual (EGO) fits within a larger kindred (depicted by terms of reference) and also the rights and obligations that EGO has to these individuals (depicted by terms of address).
Embedded within the kinship structure is the family, those believed to be related to each other. Some families live together with mutual goals and others are disperse, claiming ancestral kinship ties. Families also include individuals who share ties of descent (consanguineal ties) and ties of marriage (affinal ties). A household is a group of individuals who live within the same residence and share socio-economic needs. This may or may not include more than one family. There are various types of families across cultures, including the nuclear family, extended family, nontraditional family, and blended family. Many families also include fictive kin, individuals who are included within the intimate family and perceived to have relationships as close as those of blood or marriage. Godparenthood, called <em data-effect="italics">compadrazgo</em> in Latin American, is an example of fictive kin.
Kinship is graphically depicted by means of a kinship chart, which shows the kindred connected by consanguineal and affinal ties. All kinship charts use a point of reference referred to as EGO, the individual whose relationships are traced on the chart. There are three major types of kinship structure, lineal kinship, which highlights the nuclear family; bifurcate merging kinship, which distinguishes between parallel and cross cousins; and generational kinship, which greatly expands the family of orientation to include all kindred within the same generation. Ties of descent, whether unilineal, ambilineal, or bilateral, drive connections within a kinship chart. In some families descent (and inheritance) are traced only through only one of EGO&#x2019;s parents (unilineal or ambilineal) and in others descent is traced through both parental lines (bilateral).
EGO&#x2019;s family of orientation is ideally created through a marriage (affinal tie), but what constitutes marriage varies greatly across cultures. In short, marriage is best defined as the formation of a new, socially sanctioned family. Some societies practice monogamy, the marriage of only two adults at a time. Where individuals can and do change partners during their lifetimes, they may practice serial monogamy. In other societies, polygamy is the marriage ideal. While polygamous unions usually begin as two adults, polygamy sanctions a marriage of more than two adults. When there is an ideal of one man with multiple wives, it is known as polygyny, and where there is one woman with more than one husband, it is called polyandry. How and who one marries is also regulated by rules of post-marital residence including neolocal, patrilocal, matrilocal, avunculocal, and ambilocal types. Each of these is adapted to the descent rule utilized by the society in reckoning kinship.
Unilineal descent, with the creation of lineages distinguishing the husband from the wife, also involves marriage compensations, such as bride wealth, bride service, and dowry. Marriage compensation formalizes the alliance between the two lineages involved in the marriage and also compensates one lineage for the loss of a young person and their offspring (as residence rules will require them to live with the lineage of their spouse). Remarriage obligations are also common in unilineal societies where the marriage is structure to endure even beyond death.
